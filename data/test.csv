" a small group of palestinian protesters on sunday set fire to placards printed with images of u.s. vice president mike pence and middle east negotiator jason greenblatt outside jesus s traditional birthplace, days before their arrival in the region. with bethlehem s illuminated christmas tree behind them, about 30 people stood quietly holding candles at manger square next to the church of the nativity, the site christians believe marks jesus s birthplace, before setting the placards alight.  bethlehem welcomes the messengers of peace, not the messengers of war , read some placards with pictures of pence and greenblatt as they went up in flames. the u.s. vice president is due in the region later this week but the palestinians have said he is not welcome and president mahmoud abbas will not meet him during his visit, palestinian foreign minister riyad al maliki said last week, a move the white house described as  unfortunate . greenblatt, who has held several rounds of discussions with israeli and palestinian officials during the past few months in an effort to restart peace talks that have been frozen since 2014, is also due to arrive this week. violent protests have been held almost daily in the palestinian territories over u.s. president donald trump s dec. 6 announcement in which he overturned long standing u.s. policy on jerusalem and said he was recognizing it as israel s capital. palestinian militants have also increased the firing of rockets at israel since trump s announcement and two were launched on sunday. one landed in an israeli community close to the gaza border and damaged property but no casualties were reported initially, a police spokesman said. most countries consider east jerusalem, which israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be decided at future israeli palestinian talks.  israel has welcomed trump s announcement as recognizing political reality and biblical jewish roots in jerusalem. it says that all of jerusalem   a city holy to jews, muslims and christians   is its capital, while palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

" the u.s. missile attack on a syrian airbase on friday will elevate political tensions but is not expected to lead to a military escalation, said a senior official in the military alliance supporting president bashar al assad. “no doubt this will leave great tension on the political level, but i do not expect a military escalation. currently i do not believe that we are going towards a big war in the region,” the official told reuters. the official, a non syrian, spoke on condition of anonymity, saying this was a personal assessment and not said as a spokesman for the alliance. assad has been backed in the six year old war by russia, iran and shi’ite militias from countries including iraq, lebanon and afghanistan. “i doubt that the russians will escalate towards military friction with the americans,” the official said.

" u.s. president donald trump struck a blow against the 2015 iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. trump announced the major shift in u.s. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the middle east. he accused iran of “not living up to the spirit” of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to congress.  he singled out iran’s islamic revolutionary guard corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in syria, yemen and iraq. “we will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of iran’s nuclear breakout,” trump said. trump’s hardline remarks drew praise from israel, iran’s arch foe, but was criticized by european allies. the move by trump was part of his “america first” approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord and the trans pacific partnership trade talks and renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico. his iran strategy angered tehran and put washington at odds with other signatories of the accord   britain, france, germany, russia, china and the european union   some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with iran. responding to trump, iranian president hassan rouhani said on friday on television that tehran was committed to the deal and accused trump of making baseless accusations. “the iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,” he said. “iran and the deal are stronger than ever.” european allies have warned of a split with the united states over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as trump has done undermines u.s. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say iran is in compliance with the accord.                 the chief of the u.n. atomic watchdog reiterated that iran was under the world’s “most robust nuclear verification regime.” “the nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under the jcpoa are being implemented,” yukiya amano, director general of the international atomic energy agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name. u.s. democrats expressed skepticism at trump’s decision. senator ben cardin said: “at a moment when the united states and its allies face a nuclear crisis with north korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.” while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement, he gave the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact. if congress reimposes the sanctions, the united states would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. if lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker was working on amending the iran nuclear agreement review act law to include “trigger points” that if crossed by iran would automatically reimpose u.s. sanctions. the trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, iran’s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal’s “sunset clauses” under which some of the restrictions on iran’s nuclear program expire over time.  trump directed u.s. intelligence agencies to probe whether iran might be working with north korea on its weapons programs. the president, who took office in january, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as “the worst deal ever.” it was negotiated under his predecessor, former president barack obama. trump warned that if “we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.” “we’ll see what happens over the next short period of time and i can do that instantaneously,” he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now. the trump administration designated the entire islamic revolutionary guard corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. the administration stopped short of labeling the group a foreign terrorist organization, a list maintained by the state department. the revolutionary guard is the single most dominant player in iran’s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in iran’s domestic and foreign policies. it had already previously been sanctioned by the united states under other authorities, and the immediate impact of friday’s measure is likely to be symbolic. the u.s. military said on friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on iran in support of trump’s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of u.s. forces. but u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and iran had not responded to trump’s announcement with any provocative acts so far.

" if hillary clinton decided to run as an independent for new york city mayor this year, she would open with a sizable lead over incumbent democrat bill de blasio, according to quinnipiac university poll released on wednesday. clinton led de blasio 49 percent to 30 percent in the survey of 1,138 city voters. it had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. since democrat clinton’s loss to republican president elect donald trump in november, there has been speculation that the former u.s. secretary of state and u.s. senator from new york state might set her sights on the new york city mayoralty this year. political analysts have dismissed the rumors, saying there is little chance clinton, 69, would seek de blasio’s office after coming so close to winning the white house. clinton’s camp has not denied the possibility outright, though advisers have said they do not expect her to seek public office again. a spokesman for de blasio’s re election campaign and a clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the poll may also be a reflection of de blasio’s public standing, which has had its ups and downs during his four year term. forty five percent of those surveyed approved of de blasio, while a nearly identical 46 percent did not. nevertheless, the poll showed de blasio ahead of other possible challengers, including former city council speaker christine quinn, who lost to de blasio in the 2013 democratic primary, and city comptroller scott stringer. “new yorkers aren’t in love with mayor bill de blasio, but they seem to like him better than other possible choices – except hillary clinton, who probably is an impossible choice,” tim malloy, the poll’s assistant director, said in a statement. the poll was apparently the first major survey to include clinton as a potential mayoral candidate. new york city has never had a female mayor. in the nov. 8 presidential election, clinton captured more than 80 percent of new york city votes, even though trump was born and raised in the heavily democratic city. she moved in 1999 to chappaqua, new york, about 30 miles north of the city, in order to run for the u.s. senate.

" president barack obama on friday vetoed legislation allowing families of victims of the sept. 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia, which could prompt congress to overturn his decision with a rare veto override, the first of his presidency. obama said the justice against sponsors of terrorism act would hurt u.s. national security and harm important alliances, while shifting crucial terrorism related issues from policy officials into the hands of the courts. the bill passed the senate and house of representatives in reaction to long running suspicions, denied by saudi arabia, that hijackers of the four u.s. jetliners that attacked the united states in 2001 were backed by the saudi government. fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals. obama said other countries could use the law, known as jasta, as an excuse to sue u.s. diplomats, members of the military or companies   even for actions of foreign organizations that had received u.s. aid, equipment or training. “removing sovereign immunity in u.s. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments’ actions abroad had a connection to terrorism related injuries on u.s. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the united states, our forces, and our personnel,” obama said in a statement. senator chuck schumer, who co wrote the legislation and has championed it, immediately made clear how difficult it will be for obama to sustain the veto. schumer, the no. 3 democrat in the senate, issued a statement within moments of receiving the veto, promising that it would be “swiftly and soundly overturned.” he represents new york, home of most of the sept. 11 victims. both the democratic and republican candidates for president, hillary clinton and donald trump, said they would have signed the bill into law if they were in the white house. if two thirds of the lawmakers in both the senate and house vote to override, the law would stand, the first such override since he became president in 2009, and possibly the last.  obama leaves office in january. friday’s veto was the twelfth of his presidency. an override has been expected, despite some lawmakers saying they had doubts about the measure. in a letter seen by reuters on friday, republican representative mac thornberry, chairman of the powerful house armed services committee, said he would oppose the override. “my primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to american military and intelligence personnel, diplomats and others serving our country around the world,” thornberry wrote in a letter encouraging his fellow republicans to sustain the veto. house speaker paul ryan said wednesday he thought there were enough votes to override a veto, but had concerns. “i worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. and i do worry about the precedent,” he told reporters. the “9/11 families & survivors united for justice against terrorism” group, which has pressed congress to uphold the legislation, called obama’s veto explanation “unconvincing and unsupportable.” the saudi government has lobbied heavily to stop the bill,  the european union has formally opposed it and gulf states have condemned it. major u.s. corporations such as general electric and dow chemical have also pressed lawmakers to reconsider. “the bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize vital bilateral relationships and the global economy,” ge chief executive jeffrey immelt said in a letter to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who supports the bill.

" china s foreign ministry on monday defended trade with the united states as a win win scenario ahead of a speech by u.s. president donald trump laying out a new national security strategy that makes clear that china is a competitor. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping while also demanding that beijing increase pressure on north korea over its nuclear program and changes in trade practices to make them more favorable to the united states. chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said she was unable to comment on the strategy until it was unveiled. but in principle, china hopes the strategy can play a constructive role in promoting world peace and stability and promoting china u.s. strategic mutual trust, hua told a daily news conference. the essence of china u.s. trade and economic ties is mutually beneficial and win win, directly and indirectly supporting 2.6 million u.s. jobs, she added.  in 2015, the profits of u.s. firms that invested in china reached $36.2 billion, and china will continue to support trade and investment liberalization, hua said.  we are willing to work hard with the u.s. side to dedicate ourselves to building a robust, stable and healthy trade and economic relationship,  she added. that was in the interests of both sides and the expectation of the international community, hua said.  the national security strategy to be rolled out in trump s speech, should not be seen as a bid to contain china but rather to offer a clear eyed look at the challenges it poses, said u.s. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.  trump made his first visit as president to china last month, where he lauded his meetings on trade and north korea as  very productive . washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs china s cooperation on north korea, though xi, at least in public when trump was in beijing, went no further than reiterating china s determination to achieve denuclearization through talks. china and the united states have also repeatedly clashed over trade issues, including state support for chinese firms and intellectual property rights violations in china. on friday, china s finance ministry said it would cut export taxes on some steel products and ditch those for sales abroad of steel wire, rod and bars from jan. 1, stirring concern in the united states and europe that the world s top steel producer may be looking to sell its excess product abroad. it follows a ministerial level g20 meeting in berlin last month, where china and the united states remained at odds over how to tackle excess steel capacity. the global steel sector is worth about $900 billion a year.

" armed men in masks blocked off the center of ukraine s rebel controlled city of luhansk on tuesday in what the rebel leader said was a revolt by supporters of a sacked regional police chief. in fighting that broke out in 2014, russian backed rebels threw off rule by a new pro western leadership in kiev and set up two self proclaimed separatist statelets in eastern ukraine, one centered on luhansk and another around the city of donetsk. those separatist regions are aided by moscow but not recognized by any state, and they have been dogged by outbreaks of internal tensions that have on occasion turned violent. the organisation for security and co operation in europe, which monitors the implementation of a much violated ceasefire agreement with ukraine, said on tuesday it had observed military style vehicles and armed men in central luhansk. the tension in luhansk did not appear to have any direct connection to the conflict between the rebels and ukraine s government, but president petro poroshenko called a meeting of his security and defense council late on tuesday.  the ukrainian armed forces are ready for all developments to ensure the safety of civilians,  poroshenko said in a statement. residents of luhansk, capital of the self proclaimed luhansk people s republic (lnr), saw unidentified armed men blocking access to downtown streets on tuesday morning, according to local media and a resident of the city. the osce s monitoring mission posted photos on twitter that showed lines of heavy military trucks and armored personnel carriers in central luhansk. the lnr s rebel leader, igor plotnitsky, blamed disgruntled supporters of igor kornet, his chief of police whom he said he had fired on monday.  the attempts by certain elements in the interior ministry in this way to challenge the decision .... (to remove kornet) have gone beyond the bounds of what is acceptable,  plotnitsky said in a statement on his administration s web site.  i can say with confidence that the attempts by certain persons to stay in power by destabilizing the situation ... are futile, and in the very near future will be neutralized.  but kornet said he was still in his job, and demanded that senior figures in the region s rebel leadership be prosecuted.  i want to dispel rumors that i ve been removed,  he said in a video message, clad in field camouflage.  we have the situation completely under control.  he said that he had uncovered evidence that several senior lnr officials, acting in collusion with kiev, were  involved in criminal activity to the detriment of the interests of the republic and the people of luhansk .  last night i provided all the documents available to the ...igor plotnitsky, who decided to launch criminal cases and arrest those involved,  kornet said. in his statement the luhansk rebel leader contradicted this, saying there were no grounds to arrest the officials identified by kornet. the conflict in the country s east between ukrainian government forces and pro russian separatists has killed over 10,000 people. russia denies accusations from ukraine and nato that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.

" the blue cross blue shield association, which represents insurers in every state, cigna corp and humana inc said on friday they would attend a meeting between the health insurance industry and president donald trump on monday.  cigna’s chief executive officer, david cordani, and humana ceo bruce broussard will attend, spokesmen for both companies said. bloomberg reported earlier on friday that top executives from u.s. health insurers would attend a meeting, based on unnamed sources. the white house has not confirmed the bloomberg report. trump has pledged to repeal and replace obamacare, former president barack obama’s national healthcare law that redesigned the u.s. insurance market for individuals. it is not clear yet what republicans will agree upon to replace the current insurance. insurers say any new plans are not likely to hit the market before 2019. insurers have also asked for changes to the individual insurance market that would go into effect for 2018 to make the market more attractive to the industry, where some plans have lost hundreds of millions of dollars because member costs were higher than they expected. the trump administration proposed a rule last week to address some insurer concerns, but insurers would also like to see the elimination of an industry wide tax on health insurance premiums   though the tax is on hiatus this year    and a promise that the government will continue to provide cost sharing subsidies to certain individual insurance members.  since taking office on jan. 20, trump has held a series of white house meetings with executives from different sectors including those from manufacturing companies, pharmaceutical makers, technology businesses and car makers.

" rohingya refugees in bangladesh could die due to a lack of  food, shelter and water, given the huge numbers fleeing violence in myanmar, an aid agency warned on sunday, as authorities began moving people to camps to streamline the distribution of help. nearly 410,000 members of the rohingya muslim minority fled from myanmar s western rakhine state to bangladesh to escape a military offensive that the united nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,  mark pierce, bangladesh country director for the save the children aid agency said in a statement.  i m particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. if families can t meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.  bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of rohingya fleeing persecution in buddhist majority myanmar, where the rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants. bangladesh was already home to 400,000 rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp in the western state of rakhine, killing a dozen people. pierce said the humanitarian response needed to be rapidly scaled up.  that can only be done if the international community steps up funding,  he said. rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say myanmar security forces and rakhine buddhist vigilantes responded to the aug. 25 insurgent attacks with what they say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the muslim population. myanmar rejects that, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army, which claimed responsibility for the august attacks and similar, smaller, raids in october. the myanmar government has declared the group a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. bangladesh border guards said the flow of refugees leaving myanmar had eased off over the past day, apparently because bad weather had discouraged people from taking to boats to reach bangladesh.  heavy rain has turned roads into mud, with refugees huddling under shelters of bamboo and plastic sheets beside them. bangladeshi authorities said they had started moving an estimated 100,000 rohingya living by the roads to camps designated as aid points.  we re not allowing any distribution to anyone from the side of the road,  said district government official kazi abdur rahman.  we want to convince them there s everything in the camp and nothing here.  a big new camp is planned but it is unclear how long it would take to build.  people are living in these muddy, awful conditions. you have to get them to some sort of space where aid can be delivered,  said chris lom of the international organization for migration.   clean water and sanitation can only be delivered in a structured environment.  there is no sign that violence has stopped in myanmar, with smoke, apparently from burning villages, seen as recently as friday, meaning more refugees are likely to cross. human rights watch said satellite imagery showed 62 rohingya villages had been torched since the violence erupted. myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, and about 30,000 non muslim villagers have been displaced.  myanmar government leader and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. the military remains in full control of security policy and there is little sympathy for the rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities, and the military campaign in rakhine state is widely supported. suu kyi is due to make her first address to the nation on the crisis on tuesday. her foreign supporters and western governments that backed her campaign against military rule, and see her as the best hope for myanmar s future, will be hoping to see her make a commitment to protect the rights of the muslim minority. suu kyi s supporters at home could be disappointed if she is perceived to be caving in to foreign pressure and taking the side of a muslim minority blamed for initiating the violence. the united states has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state, patrick murphy, is due in myanmar this week. he will travel to sittwe, the capital of rakhine state, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern rakhine state. the military has called for unity on the issue. the political party founded by retired officers and trounced by suu kyi s party in the 2015 election, could be expected to take heart to see her support eroded by the crisis.

" nigeria s military has repelled an attempt by suspected boko haram militants to seize the northeastern town of magumeri, a spokesman said on sunday, a day after the attack. the assault was the latest in a series of attacks in northeast nigeria, where the conflict with the islamist insurgency has dragged into a ninth year with little sign of an end. three soldiers were killed and six others wounded while fighting the militants in magumeri, which lies 50 km (30 miles) from borno state capital maiduguri, which has been the center of the conflict, the military spokesman said. a member of a vigilante group formed to fight boko haram put the death toll at six soldiers and three vigilantes, while a resident of magumeri told reuters by telephone that at least three civilians were also killed. a suicide bomber killed at least 58 people on tuesday at a mosque in neighboring adamawa state, one of the deadliest attacks since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end the boko haram insurgency.

" a senior leader of al qaeda s yemeni branch has called for attacks on myanmar authorities in support of minority rohingya muslims, the site monitoring center said on saturday as thousands fled what they say is a government assault on their villages. myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingya pose one of the biggest challenges facing leader aung san suu kyi, accused by western critics of failing to support the muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. in a video message released by al qaeda s al malahem media foundation, khaled batarfi called on muslims in bangladesh, india, indonesia and malaysia to support their rohingya muslim brethren against the  enemies of allah.  batarfi, who was freed from a yemeni prison in 2015 when al qaeda in the arabian peninsula (aqap) seized the port city of mukalla, also urged al qaeda s indian subcontinent (aqis) branch to carry out attacks.  so spare no effort in waging jihad against them and repulsing their attacks, and beware of letting down our brothers in burma (myanmar),  batarfi said, according to the u.s. based monitoring center. about 58,600 rohingya have fled into neighboring bangladesh from myanmar, according to u.n. refugee agency unhcr. myanmar officials accuse the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) of burning homes. the group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter offensive. but rohingya fleeing to bangladesh say the myanmar army is conducting a campaign of arson and killings to drive them out. the rohingya are denied citizenship in myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. bangladesh, where more than 400,000 rohingya live since they began fleeing myanmar in the 1990s, is also growing increasingly hostile to the minority.

" three men wanted for the killing of kim jong nam were driven to the murder site in a car bought by a north korean embassy official, a malaysian court was told on wednesday, bringing into focus the embassy s role in the sensational murder. two women, indonesian siti aisyah and doan thi huong, a vietnamese, are charged with conspiring with four north korean fugitives to kill the north korean leader s half brother using banned chemical weapon vx, at the kuala lumpur international airport on feb. 13. defense lawyers say the women were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality tv show. closed circuit television recordings played in court on wednesday showed three of the fugitives at the airport in a car registered to a north korean suspect named ri jong chol. jong chol, who was arrested and deported shortly after the murder, told investigators the car had been bought in his name by a north korean embassy official named chal su in october 2016, lead investigator wan azirul nizam che wan aziz said.  we made a request to the north korean embassy to identify and question chal su, but did not receive any cooperation,  wan azirul told the court. airport video recordings screened in court earlier showed the embassy s second secretary and a manager for north korean airline air koryo helping the four fugitives flee immediately after the murder. wan azirul on wednesday named the two individuals as north korean embassy second secretary hyon kwang song and air koryo manager kim uk il. both men had gone into hiding at the embassy in kuala lumpur, along with ri ji u, a 30 year old north korean also known as james, after warrants were issued for their arrest, wan azirul said. police took statements from the embassy s second secretary and the air koryo official before releasing them, but did not pursue ji u or chal su in the absence of instructions to do so, wan azirul said.  during this probe, which involves international issues, i faced many constraints in investigating and needed to refer to my superior officers before taking any action,  he added. north korea has vehemently denied accusations by south korean and u.s. officials that kim jong un s regime was behind the killing. kim jong nam, who was living in exile in macau, had criticized his family s dynastic rule of north korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some south korean lawmakers have said. the murder unraveled once close ties between malaysia and north korea. malaysia was forced to return kim jong nam s body and allow the suspects hiding in the embassy to return home, in exchange for the release of nine malaysians barred from leaving pyongyang.

" hamas  security chief in the gaza strip was wounded in a car bombing on friday in what the islamist group called a failed assassination attempt. the attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10 year rift that has effectively split the palestinian territories between hamas in gaza and the more mainstream fatah in the occupied west bank. tawfeeq abu naeem, hamas  head of security in gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal, was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque, hamas said in a statement. hamas, which has been quick to blame israel for similar attacks in the past, did not say who it believed was behind the bombing, suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist salafi group that opposes the palestinian rapprochement. asked about the explosion in gaza, israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports. hamas has stepped up a security campaign against salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative. hamas also has improved ties with egypt, which is battling islamist groups across the border in the sinai peninsula. some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal. senior fatah officials traveled to gaza this week from the west bank to take control of two government offices there, but they turned back, saying hamas officials refused their authority. a fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved.

" (this story corrects sixth paragraph to say matt schlapp was white house political director, not deputy.) dozens of former appointees of the administration of former president george w. bush announced their support for republican presidential nominee donald trump on sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of trump’s first debate with democrat hillary clinton. the bush family and many connected to it remain cool to trump. former president george h.w. bush reportedly plans to vote for clinton in the nov. 8 election while his jeb, a former trump rival, has said he will not vote for clinton or trump. george w. bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for republican congressional candidates. but a number of former bush appointees have decided to endorse trump, the new york businessman who is in a tight race with clinton and is to debate her one one one at hofstra university on monday night in hempstead, new york. fifty former bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of bush alumni supportive of trump. the list was provided by a republican official close to the trump campaign. the list included former white house press secretary ari fleischer, former u.s. attorney general john ashcroft, former labor secretary elaine chao, former treasury secretary john snow and former health and human services secretary tommy thompson. the list also included former defense secretary donald rumsfeld, former veterans affairs secretary anthony principi and former white house political director matt schlapp, who is chairman of the american conservative union. thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list. “americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight forward and honest with them,” thompson said. trump has struggled to rally many in the republican party behind him. on friday, he received the endorsement of former rival ted cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as ohio governor john kasich.

" president barack obama wants to boost u.s. aid to colombia to help remove landmines and implement the government’s peace accord with a leftist rebel group, the white house said on tuesday. obama would discuss the plan with colombian president juan manual santos during a white house visit on thursday, and invite u.s. lawmakers to participate in two events aimed at showing support for the potential deal that would end latin america’s longest war. the fight between the colombian government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions more since it began in 1964. three previous attempts at a peace accord failed. after almost four years of talks, an elusive peace deal may finally be in sight, said bernard aronson, the u.s. envoy to the negotiations. “i think there’s a real prospect for success and signing of a peace accord this year, hopefully within the first half of this year,” aronson told reporters on a conference call. under the deal, farc rebels would disarm, and the government would need to expand health and education services into areas of the country that had been controlled by the group   two areas where expanded u.s. financial aid could help, said mark feierstein, a senior director at the white house national security council. “one of the biggest challenges will be to demobilize the farc and ensure their reintegration into society as constructive members,” feierstein said. feierstein declined to comment on how much additional aid obama would propose. the united states has long been a donor to colombia, providing almost $10 billion in aid between 2000 and 2015 through a program called plan colombia, according to the congressional research service. colombia’s government on tuesday warned the country’s second largest rebel group, the national liberation army (eln), that time is running out to begin peace negotiations to end five decades of war. any eln talks would be independent of those with the farc. on thursday, santos meets with vice president joe biden and a group of u.s. senators at biden’s residence to talk about the peace process and the future of u.s. support for colombia, before later meeting obama in the oval office. obama and santos were also expected to discuss ways the two countries can work together to fight the zika virus, feierstein said.

" support for the far right, anti immigration sweden democrats party has fallen to its lowest level since surging during the migration crisis of 2015, a government poll showed on tuesday.  the sweden democrats  approval rating shot to nearly 20 percent in november 2015 after hundreds of thousands of people arrived in sweden to seek asylum. but a stricter immigration policy has led to a big reduction in numbers, and the issue has slipped from the top of the political agenda.  support for the sweden democrats stood at 14.8 percent in november, compared to 18.4 percent in june, sweden s statistics office found in its twice yearly poll for which it interviewed  9,000 people between oct. 27 and nov. 28.  the government, comprised of the social democrats and greens, had a 36.4 percent approval rating, compared with 35.6 percent in the june poll. prime minister stefan lofven has wooed voters with a pledge to boost spending by almost 44 billion crowns ($5.23 billion) in the budget for 2018 with much of the money going on welfare, education and the police.  immigration is no longer dominating the political debate in sweden,  jonas hinnfors, political scientist at gothenburg university said. together with the left party, which supports the coalition in parliament, the government has 43.4 percent support, up from 41.9 percent in june.     at its current level of support, the sweden democrats would still have enough clout to block either the centre left or centre right blocs from forming a government after the next election in september 2018, should they fail to reach a majority.  the sweden democrats, shunned by all the major parties due to their far right roots, have said they would help vote down either a centre left or centre right coalition in 2018, making it unclear how either bloc will be able to form a government.

" a hardline sunni muslim cleric was sentenced to death in lebanon on thursday for inciting attacks on the army, as his supporters protested outside the court. sheikh ahmad al assir, who refused to recognize the hearing, was convicted for his part in clashes that erupted amid heightened sectarian tensions in 2013, exacerbated by the war in neighboring syria. assir rose to prominence supporting the mostly sunni insurgents in syria and condemning the backers of the syrian government, including lebanon s shi ite muslim hezbollah group. lebanese soldiers raided a mosque complex belonging to assir in june 2013, after skirmishes between his supporters and opponents in the southern mediterranean port city of sidon. the army said at least 18 soldiers died in fighting with assir's supporters, which raised fears at the time of sectarian violence spreading in lebanon.

" the threat from north korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level  and the united states, japan and south korea must address the matter, japanese defense minister itsunori onodera told his u.s. and south korean counterparts in talks on monday. onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in tokyo after north korean weapons tests, including test firing missiles over japan, as pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of reaching the united states.  his comments broke from more measured language on monday by u.s. defense secretary jim mattis and south korean defense minister song young moo, as the three men met on the sidelines of a gathering of asian defense chiefs in the philippines.  (the) threat posed by north korea has grown to the unprecedented, critical and imminent level. therefore, we have to take calibrated and different responses to meet with that level of threat,  he said, speaking through a translator, at the start of talks in the philippines.  south korea s song also acknowledged that  north korea s provocative behavior is becoming worse and worse,  in public remarks before reporters were escorted out of the meeting room.  mattis renewed sharp criticism of north korea s tests, saying they  threaten regional and global security.  mattis, who kicked off a week long trip to the region on monday, has been eager to emphasize diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully as escalating tension between washington and pyongyang stoked fears of  armed confrontation.  asked about his conversation with onodera after the two met earlier in the day, before joining south korea s song, mattis said they discussed  maintaining stability and peace in support of the diplomats.  meanwhile, former u.s. president jimmy carter said he is willing to travel to north korea on behalf of the trump administration to help diffuse the situation, the new york times reported.   mattis has been more cautious in his public remarks than u.s. president donald trump, who has been locked in a war of words with north korean leader kim jong un, threatening to destroy north korea if necessary to defend the united states and its allies.  kim has blasted trump as  mentally deranged.  mattis is at the start of a week long trip to asia and will attend meetings hosted by defense ministers from the association of southeast asian nations (asean) in the philippines. asean defense ministers, in a joint statement, expressed  grave concern  over north korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications. they underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de escalate tensions in the korean peninsula.  mattis  trip, which will include a stop in thailand, comes before trump s first visit to asia next month, including a stop in china.  trump has been pressuring china to do more to rein in north korea s missile and nuclear program. china is north korea s neighbor and biggest trading partner. mattis, while in the philippines, said he will commend the military for defeating insurgents in marawi city on the islandof mindanao.  the philippines said on monday it has ended five months of military operations in marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years.     some experts see the marawi insurgency as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by islamic state loyalists to exploit mindanao s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region.      it was a tough fight,  mattis told reporters on his flight to the philippines, adding he thought the philippines  military had sent  a very necessary message to the terrorists.      on thursday, mattis will lead the u.s. delegation inthailand for the cremation rites for the late king bhumibol adulyadej.

" a saudi arabian businessman whose family s commercial empire is involved in a multi billion dollar debt dispute has been released from detention in the kingdom s eastern province, according to sources familiar with the matter. abdulaziz al sanea s release comes as the government steps up efforts to find a company to run a struggling 750 bed hospital owned by his family, a search that has turned the spotlight on the kingdom s effort to bring overseas investors into the healthcare sector. al sanea was freed late last week after being detained in october for unpaid debts, related at least in part to the hospital, according to the sources. an arrest warrant, issued in october for his brother mishal for the same reason, was also lifted, according to the same sources. at the same time, the authorities approved a plan intended to restart operations at saad specialist hospital in the city of khobar in eastern province, which has been closed in recent weeks after being unable to pay staff and contractors, according to the sources. a special committee, formed by the government to find solutions for the hospital s future, concluded that the facility should be operated under the guidance of the ministry of health for seven years, the sources said. the revenue would be deposited into the account of the court handling the liquidation of saad group, the family s company that owns the hospital, the sources added.   the ministry of justice did not respond to a reuters request for comment. london listed nmc healthcare is among companies in talks with the government to take over the running of the hospital, one of the top cancer treatment facilities in the gulf, reuters reported on thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. maan al sanea, the owner of saad group and the father of abdulaziz and mishal, is still in a civil detention center in khobar, according to the sources. he was also detained by authorities in october for unpaid debts. saad group, which at its height employed about 12,000 staff and has interests in sectors spanning banking to healthcare, ran into difficulties in 2009 because of heavy debts, unleashing a series of long running legal battles and a saudi court enforced liquidation of the company. reemas group, a financial consultancy hired by saad group, last month outlined a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt under a plan to repay part of the money owed to creditors. the legal action against the family is believed to be separate from a crackdown on corruption by crown prince mohammed bin salman in which dozens of saudi princes and businessmen are being held. the kingdom has released 23 of the 200 or so powerful individuals detained since november on corruption charges after they reached deals with the government, okaz newspaper reported on tuesday.

" president barack obama’s white house set up one last fight with the republican controlled congress over defense spending on monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day to day military programs. the house of representatives draft of the $602 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, which sets spending policy for the department of defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime overseas contingency operations, or oco, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs. the obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens u.s. security and unfairly spares the pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education. “by gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep america safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies,” the white house said in a statement. house republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in afghanistan and against islamic state militants in iraq and syria. the obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at guantanamo bay in cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in iraq and syria. obama vetoed one version of the 2016 ndaa over its use of oco funding and the guantanamo restrictions. he later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the guantanamo measures in place. it will be months before the legislation passes congress and arrives on obama’s desk. the house draft has passed the house armed services committee, and republican leaders would like a vote by the full house as soon as wednesday. however, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. the rules committee was meeting late on monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote. the senate is also drafting its version of the ndaa, which must be reconciled with the house’s before being subject to vote in both chambers. if passed, that version would be sent to the white house for obama’s signature, or veto.

" a staff writer for the trump organization took responsibility on wednesday for the “chaos” caused by a speech given by the wife of u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the party’s convention this week. the writer, meredith mciver, apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with melania trump’s speech on monday night. the republican convention in cleveland, which formally anointed trump on tuesday as the party nominee for the nov. 8 presidential election, was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox white house candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign. but the accusations of plagiarism, and the trump campaign’s responses to them, have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating democratic candidate hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. in a statement, mciver said she had inserted passages into the melania trump speech that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady michelle obama to the 2008 democratic national convention, when barack obama was in his first campaign for the presidency. mciver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy, but trump and his family had rejected the offer.  the trump organization is owned by donald trump. trump defended mciver in an abc news interview on wednesday, saying: “she made a mistake. people make mistakes. you’ve made mistakes. we all make mistakes.” he said mciver had been with him for a long time and was a “good person.” trump added: “i thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, ‘look, it was a mistake that i made.’ she thought it was very unfair to melania.” in her speech on monday, melania trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that “the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.” “my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,” melania trump told the cleveland convention. in denver eight years ago, michelle obama said she and her husband, barack, “were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you’re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.”     mciver said melania trump had read passages from michelle obama’s speech over the phone to her as examples. mciver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became melania trump’s speech. mciver said in her statement that michelle obama is a person melania trump “has always liked.”  “i did not check mrs. obama’s speeches. this was my mistake and i feel terrible for the chaos i have caused melania and the trumps, as well as to mrs. obama. no harm was meant,” mciver said. nowhere in the statement by mciver and comments by trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the republican nominee was inspired by the words of michelle obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the republican convention, echoing trump, assailed her husband’s policies. democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the trump campaign’s various explanations over the ensuing 48 hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time. the charge was all the more embarrassing because trump has repeatedly slammed clinton as untrustworthy. white house spokesman josh earnest said on wednesday the similarities showed the country’s values were largely shared, even if political leaders had differences. “that certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late, about the country not being as divided as it might seem,” earnest told reporters.  questions have lingered over why the trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other people’s words, and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem. republican strategist ted newton, president of gravity strategic communications and a staffer in republican mitt romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign, said the trump campaign should have come clean much sooner. “it sort of reflects the old adage: it’s not the crime, it’s the cover up,” newton said. “to have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her.” if the campaign had admitted what happened sooner, newton said, “it would have been a bump in the road.” hours before giving the speech, melania trump, a slovenian born jewelry designer and former model, told nbc’s “today” that she had written it with as little help as possible. but her husband’s campaign manager, paul manafort, told cbs’ “this morning” on tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers. as late as wednesday, just hours before mciver’s statement, manafort was pressed again on the issue on cnn. he did not say words had been lifted from the michelle obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech. “the controversy that you’re talking about is not meaningful at all,” he said.  mciver is listed as a writer on some of trump’s most popular books, including “trump: how to get rich” and “trump: think like a billionaire.” her author’s biography in “how to get rich” says she was a ford foundation scholar who graduated from the university of utah, as well as a member of the trump organization.

" a vatican diplomat working in washington has been recalled to the holy see after the u.s. state department said the priest may have violated child pornography laws, the vatican said on friday. prosecutors in the vatican have opened an investigation into the case, which represents a fresh blow to the roman catholic church as it struggles to overcome repeated sex abuse scandals among its clergy.  the state department notified the holy see in august  of a possible violation of laws relating to child pornography images by a member of the diplomatic corps of the holy see accredited to washington,  the vatican statement said. a state department spokesman said the united states had requested that the man s diplomatic immunity be waived to open the way for possible prosecution, but the vatican refused. the priest, who was not named, has returned to vatican city and is awaiting the outcome of the holy see investigation, which could lead to a trial in the tiny city state.  the u.s. based survivors network of those abused by priests (snap) said possession of child pornography was not a victimless crime because the children involved were being abused.  (pope francis) must bring the diplomat back to the united states in order to adhere to his promises of complying with investigations by civil authorities in cases of child sexual abuse,  snap managing director barbara dorris said. pope francis has declared zero tolerance over abuse scandals that have beset the church for decades, but has appeared to struggle to overcome resistance within the vatican hierarchy. the state department spokesman said the pope had promised to  act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse  and punish those found guilty of wrongdoing.  the united states encourages the holy see to ensure full implementation of its reforms and policies designed to protect minors and provide justice regarding allegations,  the spokesman said. two years ago the vatican put the former papal ambassador to the dominican republic on trial for child sex offences, a case that was seen as showing the pope s determination to clean up the church. the priest, jozef wesolowski, was charged with paying boys to perform sexual acts, of downloading and buying pedophile material. he died before a verdict was reached. he was the first high ranking catholic official to stand trial in the vatican on such sex charges and the case was closely watched by victims of priestly abuse, who have accused the vatican of repeatedly hushing up previous scandals. earlier this year, cardinal george pell, a top adviser to pope francis, was charged with multiple historical sex crimes in his native australia. the highest ranking church official to face such accusations, pell has denied any wrongdoing. just last month, in the foreword to a new book written by a swiss man who was raped by a priest when he was eight years old, pope francis said sexual abuse of children by priests was a  monstrosity  and pledged to take action against perpetrators.

" president donald trump’s nominee to be u.s. trade representative, robert lighthizer, said on tuesday he is  “awaiting instructions” from trump on whether to support a restoration of the export import bank’s full lending powers. the u.s. government trade bank’s loans have been capped at $10 million for more than a year because it has too few board members, with republican opponents to the bank blocking recent nominees. the cap means that exim cannot finance the largest export u.s. products such as boeing co aircraft or westinghouse nuclear reactors. asked by senator maria cantwell at his confirmation hearing whether he supports nominating new board members at the bank as part of a broad trade strategy aimed at reducing u.s. trade deficits and boosting exports, lighthizer said that decision would ultimately be up to trump. “i expect to do what the president instructs me to do when he instructs me to do it,” said lighthizer, a former ustr deputy in the reagan administration and a steel industry trade lawyer. conservative republicans in congress have tried to kill exim because they view it as providing unnecessary “corporate welfare” and putting u.s. taxpayers at risk for foreign projects.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump has fired his national political director after six weeks on the job, campaign sources said on wednesday. trump told staffers and supporters gathered backstage before a campaign rally in california on wednesday that political director rick wiley “should be fired” for his handling of a fundraising deal with the republican national committee, according to the sources.  the rnc fundraising agreement included 11 states but not nevada, where republicans in the state are angling for key victories in the november elections. three sources confirmed trump said wiley should be fired after nevada republican party chairman michael mcdonald told trump that wiley was responsible for leaving nevada out of the deal. mcdonald did not return calls seeking comment. wiley did not respond to emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment. the move is the latest in a tug of war between trump’s original campaign team, including press secretary hope hicks and  campaign manager corey lewandowski, and a group of professionals he brought in later to shore up support from more traditional corners of the republican party. the new arrivals, led by veteran strategist paul manafort, whom trump hired in late march, have urged trump to tone down some of his most provocative positions, such as his proposed ban on muslims entering the united states. but trump reprimanded manafort, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, after manafort told a gathering of rnc members at an april meeting in florida that trump was only “acting” when describing his proposed muslim ban or his plan to build a wall along the u.s. mexico border. manafort hired wiley on april 13. a statement issued by the trump campaign said wiley had been hired on a “short term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam” and it thanked him for “for helping us during this transition period.” manafort did not responds to calls and emails seeking comment.

" the u.s. house of representatives passed a defense policy bill on friday without some controversial provisions that had worried democrats, but republican lawmakers said they expect to revisit the issues once republican donald trump is in the white house. the national defense authorization act (ndaa) passed by 375 34, sending it to the u.s. senate, which is expected to vote next week on the $618.7 billion measure setting policy for the pentagon. after months of negotiation, the house and senate armed services committees unveiled a compromise version of the ndaa this week that did not include provisions such as the russell amendment, a “religious freedom” measure that democrats said would have let federal contractors discriminate against workers on the basis of gender or sexual orientation, overturning an executive order by democratic president barack obama. during debate before friday’s vote, some republicans said they wanted to revisit the issue. republicans will control both houses of congress and the white house after trump is sworn in on jan. 20. “we look forward to working directly with the incoming administration to address the concerns, not just for the dod. (department of defense), but for the government nationwide,” said republican representative mac thornberry, the house armed services committee chairman. the ndaa also includes $3.2 billion more for the pentagon than obama requested in his budget bill. some democrats objected to the increase, part of a continuing debate between the two parties over whether defense spending should be matched by non defense spending. thornberry also said he hoped the trump administration would send congress a supplemental budget request to provide even more money for the pentagon.

" the u.s. embassy to russia said on monday it would restart some visa services in u.s. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short staffed. the united states began to scale back its visa services in russia in august, drawing an angry reaction from moscow three weeks after president vladimir putin ordered washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff. the u.s. step meant russian citizens wanting to visit the united states for business, tourism or educational reasons were  no longer able to apply via u.s. consulates outside moscow and had to travel to the russian capital instead. the embassy said in a statement on monday some visa services would resume on dec. 11. “on december 11, the u.s. consulates in st. petersburg, yekaterinburg, and vladivostok will begin to offer limited interviews for non immigrant visas,” it said.

" china and pakistan will look at extending their $57 billion china pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan, chinese foreign minister wang yi said on tuesday, part of china s ambitious belt and road plan linking china with asia, europe and beyond. china has tried to position itself as a helpful party to promote talks between pakistan and afghanistan, both uneasy neighbors ever since pakistan s independence in 1947. their ties have been poisoned in recent years by afghan accusations that pakistan is supporting taliban insurgents fighting the u.s. backed kabul in order to limit the influence of its old rival, india, in afghanistan. pakistan denies that and says it wants to see a peaceful, stable afghanistan. speaking after the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of china, pakistan and afghanistan, wang said china hoped the economic corridor could benefit the whole region and act as an impetus for development. afghanistan has urgent need to develop and improve people s lives and hopes it can join inter connectivity initiatives, wang told reporters, as he announced that pakistan and afghanistan had agreed to mend their strained relations.  so china and pakistan are willing to look at with afghanistan, on the basis of win win, mutually beneficial principles, using an appropriate means to extend the china pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan,  he added. how that could happen needs the three countries to reach a gradual consensus, tackling easier, smaller projects first, wang said, without giving details. pakistani foreign minister khawaja asif said his country and china were  iron brothers , but did not directly mention the prospect of afghanistan joining the corridor.  the successful implementation of cpec (china pakistan economic corridor) projects will serve as a model for enhancing connectivity and cooperation through similar projects with neighboring countries, including afghanistan, iran and with central and west asia,  he said. india has looked askance at the project as parts of it run through pakistan administered kashmir that india considers its own territory, though wang said the plan had nothing to do with territorial disputes. china has sought to bring kabul and islamabad together partly due to chinese fears about the spread of islamist militancy from pakistan and afghanistan to the unrest prone far western chinese region of xinjiang. as such, china has pushed for pakistan and afghanistan to improve their own ties so they can better tackle the violence in their respective countries, and has also tried to broker peace talks with afghan taliban militants, to limited effect. a tentative talks process collapsed in 2015. wang said china fully supported peace talks between the afghan government and taliban and would continue to provide  necessary facilitation . the belt and road infrastructure drive aims to build a modern day  silk road  connecting china to economies in southeast and central asia by land and the middle east and europe by sea.

" retired neurosurgeon ben carson, a rival turned supporter of donald trump, overcame his stated qualms about a lack of government experience on monday to accept the president elect’s nomination to lead the department of housing and urban development. democrats criticized the republican president elect’s latest pick for his incoming administration, calling carson unqualified to take over $48 billion agency that oversees public housing. carson, a popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, has been a close adviser to trump since he dropped out of the 2016 republican presidential primary contest and he is a vice chairman of trump’s transition team. trump discussed the job with carson before the thanksgiving day holiday last month, although   despite his own presidential run   carson had previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in federal government. picking up that theme, house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on monday, “dr. ben carson is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as housing and urban development.” trump, a real estate magnate who also has no government experience and has never held public office, expressed confidence carson could do the job, saying in a statement that he “has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities.” carson, 65, is the first african american picked for a cabinet spot by trump, who takes office on jan. 20 and has been gradually filling out his administration since beating democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 presidential election. carson said he was honored to accept the post, which requires confirmation by the u.s. senate. “i feel that i can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need,” he said in the statement. republicans control the senate and senator lindsey graham, who has been a sometimes strong critic of trump, praised carson in a statement, saying “i’m sure he will be an agent of change in a department that could stand some change.” carson, a respected neurosurgeon at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore, had been considered for u.s. surgeon general and head of health and human services department. his business manager, armstrong williams, said last month that carson had decided not to serve in trump’s administration because “his life has not prepared him to be a cabinet secretary.” but carson said after meeting with trump he believed he could make a contribution. like many of the initial field of 17 white house hopefuls who vied for the republican party’s 2016 presidential nomination, carson was a frequent target of trump attacks during the campaign. but he became one of his most high profile african american supporters after trump secured the nomination. carson enjoyed a brief surge early in the presidential campaign that took him to the top of the republican polls in late 2015. but trump went after him, questioning his mental stability because of childhood incidents in which carson said he attacked his mother with a hammer and tried to stab another boy. carson’s campaign sputtered after that and he dropped out of the race in march. he would take over a department whose mission has been to help middle  and low income people find housing by offering a combination of public housing, rent subsidies and mortgage assistance. the agency oversees mortgage lending and is also responsible for enforcing laws intended to prevent discrimination against those attempting to rent or buy homes. carson has been critical of hud efforts under the administration of democratic president barack obama to compel local governments to actively seek to end discrimination, instead of just responding to instances of racial discrimination. in a column he wrote in 2015 for the washington times, carson called the program a “mandated social engineering scheme.” if confirmed to the post, he could seek to end the obama program. other picks by trump so far for his administration include: marine corps general james mattis as defense secretary, u.s.  representative mike pompeo as cia director, senator jeff sessions as attorney general, retired general michael flynn as national security adviser, republican national committee chairman reince priebus as chief of staff and right wing media executive steve bannon as chief white house strategist. trump is still considering various candidates to fill the post of u.s. secretary of state. former vice president al gore, a democrat and a longtime advocate for strong steps to tackle climate change, was scheduled to meet on monday with trump’s daughter ivanka. in the past, trump has dismissed the idea of man made climate change as a hoax and he said during the campaign that he would seek to get the united states out of the paris agreement to reduce global emissions of fossil fuels. but last month he told the new york times he had an open mind on this. meanwhile, green party presidential nominee jill stein  filed suit in federal court in pennsylvania on monday in an attempt to force a statewide recount of voting there, adding to recounts in michigan and wisconsin. even if the recounts were to proceed in all three states, there is almost no chance that they would overturn trump’s victory in last month’s election.

"federal lawmakers are investigating how a former iraqi insurgent fighter was able to lie about his identity and still get through america s  extreme  vetting process.the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee has asked attorney general jeff sessions to find out why the terror suspect s pending arrest was allegedly spiked just over a week before the election. trump had run on a tough-on-terror platform and had been critical of president obama s refugee policy. when [joint terrorism task force] and the u.s. attorney s office for the western district of texas sought to prosecute this refugee, the local law enforcement and prosecutors allegedly  met resistance  from officials within the national security division s counter terrorism section in washington dc,  committee chairman ron johnson, r-wis., said in a march 6 letter to u.s. attorney general jeff sessions. the  resistance  allegedly occurred a few weeks before the 2016 election, and local authorities believed the lack of progress in this case was handled inadequately,  johnson wrote.the suspect is an iraqi man who had entered the u.s. under a false name. his real name was not released.fox news has learned the jttf confirmed through u.s. special forces who encountered the suspect during operations that he claimed to have participated in attacks against american troops as an insurgent.at some point, the iraqi entered the u.s. through the refugee program. his activities in the u.s. triggered an investigation by jttf members, who planned to charge him with visa fraud while they investigated possible further charges.sources say the case demonstrates the challenge of vetting people with little documented history in countries where there s no paper trail.officials from the u.s. department of justice, the u.s. attorney s office in western texas and the joint terrorism task force refused comment.u.s. officials said earlier this week that nearly a third of the fbi s 1,000 ongoing domestic terrorism investigations involve those admitted to the u.s. as refugees.here s the fox national news story that doesn t include the update about the alleged obama doj coverup. fox",1
" islamic state militants set fire to three oil wells near hawija, west of the oil city of kirkuk, one of two areas of iraq still under their control, military and oil officials said on monday. iraqi security forces were using bulldozers to control the fires started by the militants in the early hours of saturday to slow the advance of u.s. backed iraqi forces and shi ite militia groups toward hawija town, military officials said.  the allas oilfield, 35 km (20 miles) south of hawija, was one of the main sources of revenue for islamic state, which in 2014 declared a caliphate in parts of syria and iraq.  terrorists are trying to use the rising smoke to avert air strikes while retreating from the area toward hawija,  said army colonel mohammed al jabouri. military officials said the fire had been brought under control at one of the wells, while the other two were still burning. they said it would take about three days to put out the fires. oil officials from the state run north oil company said it was still too risky to send its crews in to assess damage at the wells as militants may have left bombs and landmines. iraq launched an offensive on sept. 21 to dislodge islamic state from hawija. islamic state, the ultra hardline sunni muslim group, has lost control of all the oilfields it once controlled in the north of iraq.

" a republican tax bill unveiled on thursday included cuts to renewable energy tax credits considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants, but tax breaks for solar power were left largely intact. the credits, which receive broad bipartisan support, were extended by congress less than two years ago. the wind industry decried the proposal, saying it put $50 billion in planned investment at risk, while the solar sector expressed relief the bill mostly preserved the timeline laid out in 2015 for its primary tax credit. in the same legislation, republicans proposed eliminating the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. greg wetstone, president of the non profit american council on renewable energy, said the move was “mystifying.” “wind has particularly been a boon in rural areas where there aren’t a lot of economic choices,” wetstone said, noting that wind had strong support in the senate, which has yet to weigh in on the bill. of major concern to wind developers, the legislation called for a reduced credit for every kilowatt hour of energy produced from wind projects.  in 2015 and 2016, the credit was worth 2.4 cents, dropping by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019. in the proposed bill, that credit would drop to 1.5 cents per kwh. in addition, projects must show that there is continuous construction in order to claim the tax credit available on the day construction starts.  the provision would increase tax revenue by $12.3 billion from 2018 to 2027, according to the bill summary. in a statement, the american wind energy association trade group said investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy enacted in 2015 in planning billions of dollars of investment in wind energy. “the house proposal would pull the rug out from under 100,000 u.s. wind workers and 500 american factories,” awea chief executive tom kiernan said in a statement. the solar industry’s main trade group, the solar energy industries association, said it was encouraged that a tax credit worth 30 percent of the value of a solar project had been left mostly intact. under current law, that credit is scheduled to step down in value gradually until 2022, when it becomes a permanent 10 percent credit only for utility and commercial projects. the bill unveiled on thursday would eliminate the 10 percent tax credit, but not until after 2027.

" countries involved in the trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade pact will continue working to bring a deal to fruition despite a pledge by u.s. president elect donald trump to withdraw from the accord, chile’s foreign minister said on tuesday. “whether it be with the united states or without the united states, there’s a willingness among the countries that make up the tpp to move forward,” heraldo munoz told a news conference ahead of a visit by chinese president xi jinping to the south american nation. “whether it’s to be the same framework as the current tpp, that remains to be seen.” on monday, trump released a video pledging to withdraw from the tpp on his first day in office, calling it “a potential disaster” for the united states.  world leaders have had varying reactions to trump’s comments, with japanese prime minister shinzo abe saying during a visit to buenos aires that u.s. abandonment of the deal would render it “meaningless.” the future of the 12 nation deal, which does not include china, was one of the key themes of summit talks between leaders of asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) economies in lima in recent days. there is debate over to what extent a u.s. free tpp might  advance without a complete renegotiation. china has been pushing its own alternative trade pact, which excludes the americas, although it has said other countries including chile are interested in joining. the chinese premier was due to arrive in santiago on tuesday, where he will meet with chilean president michelle bachelet and speak at the united nations’ latin american arm, eclac. munoz said china and chile plan to sign an agreement to deepen bilateral trade ties during xi’s visit. in a column in national newspaper el mercurio published on tuesday, xi wrote that chile and china should work together to facilitate free trade and business ties in areas such as mining, agriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications, clean energy and it.

" china’s state news agency xinhua described u.s. president donald trump’s decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord as a “global setback” and rejected trump’s claim that it would lead to many more jobs in america. in a commentary published on friday, xinhua suggested that no one country was now likely take up leadership of global efforts to fight climate change. china overtook the united states as the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007 but analysts see the u.s. withdrawal as an opportunity for china to burnish its image as a global leader. “trump’s decision to ditch the paris deal will leave a fairly big shoe for a single country to fill,” xinhua said, adding that major players such as china, the european union and india had reiterated their willingness to step up efforts. leaving the 2015 paris accord would hardly translate into a substantial increase in new jobs as the fossil fuel industries were highly automated, xinhua said. noting that trump said he had had “extensive discussions” with people on both sides of the climate debate, it said: “one can only assume that trump has very good reasons to leave the paris agreement, and that he knows the implications of u.s. retreat from the landmark deal”. trump, tapping into the “america first” message he used when he was elected president last year, said the paris accord would undermine the u.s. economy, cost u.s. jobs, weaken american national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other countries such as china. the global times, an influential state run tabloid, said in an editorial published on thursday before trump’s announcement that china was not interested in discussions about the leadership of fighting climate change and would focus on its own promises to reduce emissions. it called the withdrawal “reckless” and would “waste  increasingly finite u.s. diplomatic resources.” “there are indeed some underprivileged people in the u.s, but their troubles are mainly caused by bad internal governance. seeking external reasons for domestic woes is by no means what the world’s largest economy should do,” it said.

" china’s foreign minister on thursday called on north korea not to go further in a “dangerous direction” with its nuclear program and said negotiations were the only way out of the crisis over pyongyang’s weapons development. wang yi also told the annual u.n. general assembly china was committed to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and there should be no new nuclear weapons north or south of the border, or elsewhere in northeast asia. he urged the united states to honor its “four ‘no’ commitment,” an apparent reference to an aug. 1 statement by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, in which he said washington did not seek the collapse or change of the north korean government, accelerated reunification of the peninsula, or to send its military north of the border. “we urge the dprk not to go further along a dangerous direction,” wang said, referring to north korea by the acronym of its official name, the democratic people’s republic of korea. “and we call upon all parties to play a constructive role in easing tensions. there is still hope for peace and we must not give up. negotiation is the only way out, which deserves every effort. parties should meet each other half way, by addressing each other’s legitimate concerns.” wang made no mention in his speech of u.s. president donald trump’s announcement of new sanctions on thursday that open the door wider to blacklisting people and entities doing business with north korea, including its shipping and trade networks. china, north korea’s main trading partner, has backed successive rounds of united nations sanctions over north korean nuclear bomb tests, but has repeatedly said it is opposed to unilateral sanctions and especially “long arm jurisdiction” over chinese entities and individuals.

" illinois governor bruce rauner said on monday the state has the power to block any debt offerings by financially distressed school districts, including the cash strapped chicago public schools (cps), which has been dependent on borrowing to fund operations.  the republican governor last week launched a financial probe of the nation’s third largest public school system through the illinois state board of education. rauner, who has called for a state takeover of the school district, said the board has the legal authority to block borrowings by districts found to be in financial duress.   “the state board has never chosen to do that for the city of chicago. i hope that never becomes necessary. but we’ve got to be ready to take action,” rauner told reporters. rauner’s office pointed to a provision of the school code that it says applies to cps. the provision prohibits the sale of bonds, notes or other debt by a district certified to be in financial difficulty until a financial plan is approved by the state board of education. cps chief executive forrest claypool contended that the authority rauner seeks to exercise does not apply to cps, according to a school district spokeswoman. cps is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit, caused largely by escalating annual pension payments that will reach $676 million this fiscal year. the district’s efforts to gain an additional $480 million in state dollars to pay its pension bill have become entangled in an ongoing impasse between rauner and democrats who control the legislature. to keep operating in anticipation of $1 billion in property tax revenue next month, cps turned to short term borrowing and a $725 million bond sale earlier this month for cash flow. the district said it plans to seek additional short term borrowing authority from its governing board in the future. rauner said accusations by chicago officials that he attempted to derail the feb. 3 bond sale by pushing for a state takeover or possible bankruptcy for cps were “completely false.” skittish investors demanded hefty yields for the “junk” rated bonds, which will cost the district nearly $1.9 billion to pay off by 2044.

" the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) will have proportionally more lawmakers with an immigrant background in the new parliament than chancellor angela s conservatives, according to a survey. the afd, which enters parliament for the first time after winning 12.6 percent of the vote in sunday s election, has been sharply critical of merkel s decision to take in 1.3 million mainly muslim migrants and says islam has no place in germany. yet 7.5 percent of the afd s 93 lawmakers have an immigrant background compared with only 2.5 percent of the conservatives, according to the survey by mediendienst integration, an online portal that collects data on immigration and asylum. that leaves the afd and the conservative bloc each with seven lawmakers with a recent immigrant background.  ironically, by entering parliament, the anti immigrant afd has contributed to a rise in the number of deputies with an immigration background,  said jannis panagiotidis of osnabrueck university. some 22.5 percent of germany s 82 million population have an immigrant background, which means they did not have german citizenship at birth or were born to at least one parent who was not born german. merkel s christian democrats (cdu) and their christian social union (csu) bavarian allies won most seats in the election on sept. 24, which secured merkel a fourth term but saw her conservatives  support plunge to its lowest level in the post war period. the cdu/csu, which together have 246 seats in the bundestag lower house, are expected to try to build a coalition with the pro business free democrats (fdp) and the greens. the afd is the third largest party in the new lower house bundestag, behind the center left social democrats. the new 709 seat assembly will have a total 57 members with an immigration background, 20 more than in the outgoing bundestag, which had 630 seats. the far left die linke has the highest percentage of immigrant deputies   nearly 19 percent.

" syrian americans on friday hailed the u.s. missile attack on a syrian air base as a blow for human rights, but said they were wary of both president donald trump’s motives and what comes next. many who had been angered by trump’s efforts to ban syrians, along with visitors from several other muslim majority nations, welcomed what they saw as his new role as the avenger of civilians killed in this week’s chemical weapons attack. “we needed to take some action, show some backbone,” said judy asghar, 35, an american born to syrian immigrants who lives in dearborn, michigan, epicenter of one of the largest arab american communities in the united states.   some called thursday night’s military action overdue, voicing disappointment with then president barack obama’s refusal to attack the government of syrian president bashar al assad following a 2013 chemical weapons attack. “i was very glad that it finally happened, something that should have happened years ago,” ali homsi, 59, a civil engineer who moved to the united states from syria as a student in 1978, said in a telephone interview. homsi lives in tempe, arizona, but still has family in syria. many highlighted the human rights abuses that have characterized the six year civil war and what they see as the impunity of assad’s government and pro assad forces. “no one’s been enforcing that up until yesterday,” shireen jasser, a houston social worker whose father immigrated to the united states from syria, said by phone. “we’re just thankful to president trump for making this swift decision,” said jasser, president of her city’s chapter of the syrian american council. the washington based group advocates “a free, democratic, and pluralistic syria through american support.”  u.s. officials said the air base targeted on thursday was the launching point for tuesday’s poison gas attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children. some syrian americans and syrians in the united states said trump’s response to the chemical attack transformed him in their eyes. “a lot of syrian americans are now cheering the president, are elated,” said dr. mohammad kabbesh, 45, a physician who grew up in damascus but now lives in sacramento, california, said by phone. syrian refugee motaz al afandi, 49, of texas said that if trump pursues aggressive action toward assad, he could end up solving the refugee problem.  “if we get rid of al assad, we won’t need to be refugees anymore,” said al afandi, who runs a tow truck business in the dallas area and sought asylum in the united states with his wife and three children after fleeing his country’s conflict. still, some who cheered the military action said the travel ban first launched in january had left them with mixed feelings about trump, and they reserved judgment as they awaited his next steps. “we’re partway there,” said youmun alhlou, 23, of san jose, california, who works as a legal specialist at google and whose parents immigrated to the united states from syria. others questioned whether the white house was using the humanitarian crisis as an excuse for more overseas wars. “it’s part of the plan to invade more countries for various reasons, whether its oil or power,” said amir alshakarna, 31, of southfield, michigan, who became an american citizen last year and works for his family’s construction company. “the trump who did the travel ban, that’s the real trump.” asghar of dearborn said trump could be using military might to distract from the stumbles seen during his first months in office. those include the failure to persuade congress to repeal and replace obamacare, legal challenges to trump’s travel ban and continuing investigations into alleged russian meddling in the election, which russia has denied, and into potential trump associates’ ties to russia. “if this is all we do, it will mean very little except good politics for trump,” asghar said.  “americans seem to love presidents who bomb people.”  ",0

" president donald trump may do another round of interviews for the position of national security adviser with new or existing candidates on monday as he scrambles to fill the post following the ouster of michael flynn. trump interviewed four finalists on sunday and may meet with some of them again on monday, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters. the president interviewed acting adviser keith kellogg, former u.s. ambassador to the united nations john bolton, lieutenant general h.r. mcmaster and lieutenant general robert caslen at his mar a lago resort. “we may have some additional meetings and names tomorrow, and may also meet with a couple of those people again,” sanders said in florida. trump returns to washington on monday. the national security adviser is one of the most senior jobs at the white house, holding broad influence over u.s. foreign policy across the globe and presiding over the national security council staff. white house officials made clear on sunday that the new adviser would have autonomy over staffing decisions, an issue that has been reported to have thwarted some other candidates. trump’s first choice to fill the job after flynn’s departure, vice admiral robert harward, turned it down, citing family and financial reasons. another potential choice, david petraeus, a retired general and former cia chief who resigned in 2012 over an extramarital affair, was cut from the president’s short list. sources familiar with the candidates’ thinking said they both wanted control over staffing of their team, and trump was reluctant to grant that authority. white house chief of staff reince priebus denied the reports that harward and petraeus wanted more control than trump was prepared to give, and said in an interview on “fox news sunday with chris wallace” that the new adviser “can do whatever he or she wants to do with the staffing.” he said the issue never came up in discussions with harward and they “hadn’t really gone down the road” with petraeus. the white house confirmed that craig deare, the nsc’s senior director for western hemisphere affairs, had left that role. politico reported that he was dismissed for criticizing the president and his top aides. “he was just sent back to his original position, so he wasn’t fired,” sanders said. deare is on the faculty of the national defense university. asked if government employees should be concerned that they would lose their jobs if they criticized trump, sanders said: “i don’t think that any person that is there in order to carry out the president’s agenda should be against the president’s agenda.” the national security adviser is an independent aide to the president and does not require confirmation by the u.s. senate. the role has varied from administration to administration, but the adviser attends national security council meetings along with the heads of the state department, the department of defense and key security agencies.  trump has added steve bannon, his chief white house strategist, as a regular attendee of nsc meetings. political strategists have not typically been among nsc participants and bannon’s addition has drawn sharp criticism because of his previous role heading right wing website breitbart news. for a graphic on trump assembles his administration, click: here ",0

" chinese president xi jinping s vast  belt and road  infrastructure project was unexpectedly included in the ruling communist party s constitution on tuesday, giving it greater policy heft and added pressure to succeed. the party s amended charter, approved at the close of its twice a decade congress, pledged to  pursue the belt and road initiative , a further sign of xi s expanding power and evidence that the ambitious  silk road  like initiative will endure beyond xi s tenure. it also underscores how the communist party has increased its attention to foreign policy and reflects xi s growing desire for china to take a global leadership role, analysts said.  everyone knows that the belt and road is very important to xi, it has his personal stamp and authority,  said peter cai, a non resident fellow at sydney based think tank lowy institute.  but to have major policy, especially an external engagement policy, to be written into a party constitution, at least in recent memory, it is something quite significant,  he said. first mentioned during a speech xi gave to university students in kazakhstan in 2013, the plan is a vehicle for china to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries. xi has heavily promoted the initiative, inviting world leaders to beijing in may for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion ( 94 billion) in funding for the plan. local chinese governments as well as state and private firms have rushed to offer support by investing overseas and making loans.  some critics argue that china is exporting excess industrial capacity to spread its influence, and that the initiative, which has seen developing countries take on heavy debt, needs higher standards of governance and transparency.  china has made commitments and pledges to many developing countries and it will take that length of time, 10 years or more, to complete the initiative,  said rajiv biswas, asia pacific chief economist at ihs markit.  this has also strengthened china s soft power globally, so it wouldn t make sense for china s point of view to suddenly pull away from all of this,  he said.   other analysts said its inclusion could be a double edged sword that adds pressure for the initiative, which remains broadly defined and leaves much to interpretation, to succeed.  the danger of having given it greater visibility is that actually there are going to be more of those efforts to play to the policy in a political way rather than considering carefully the costs and benefits of each portion of what one is doing,  said dali yang, a professor at the university of chicago. many private investors have jumped on the bandwagon to describe their projects as belt and road related, while local governments have rolled out individual belt and road plans.  the heads of chinese firms including china communications construction co and china aerospace science and industry corporation [sasaai.ul] told reuters during the week long congress that they would place greater focus on developing their overseas businesses in support of the belt and road initiative. the party congress saw xi cement his power ahead of a second five year term and put him in the same company as the founder of modern china, mao zedong, with the enshrinement of his political thought into the country s constitution.

" french counter terrorism investigators questioned five people on tuesday after police over the weekend found what appeared to be a ready to detonate bomb at an apartment building in one of paris s poshest neighborhoods. interior minister gerard collomb said one of those arrested was on an intelligence services list of  radicalized  persons   a list that includes the names of potential islamist militants.  we are still in a state of war,  collomb, speaking after a sunday attack in which a man stabbed and killed two women outside the train station in marseille, told france inter radio. judicial sources said the explosive device included two gas canisters inside the building in the affluent 16th district of western paris and two outside, some of them doused with petrol and wired to connect to a mobile phone. more than 230 people have been killed in attacks by islamist militants in france over the past three years. the islamic state militant group, whose bases in syria and iraq are being bombed by french war planes, has urged followers to attack france. most of those killed died when islamist gunmen and suicide bombers targeted paris in 2015, and when a man drove a large truck into crowds in the riviera resort of nice in 2016. since then, there has been a string of attacks perpetrated by lone assailants, often targeting police or soldiers.  the threat is changing form,  said collomb. a counter terrorism investigation is also under way after the attack on sunday, when a man slit the throat of one of his victims and killed her cousin before being shot dead by soldiers in the southern port city. tunisian authorities have identified the attacker as ahmed hanachi, collomb told parliament. he lived in france from 2005 to 2006 and was known to police under several alias  for petty crimes, but had not previously caught the attention of french intelligence agencies. hanachi was arrested in the city of lyon on friday on suspicion of theft. he was carrying a tunisian passport and released 24 hours later, a day before committing the attack.  all these years, he used multiple identities in france as well as in italy, declaring himself to be moroccan, algerian, tunisian,  collomb said.  france declared a state of emergency in late 2015 after the paris attack, giving police special search and arrest powers to combat would be terrorists. lawmakers will vote later on tuesday on a bill to convert many of those emergency measures into common law.

" the trump international hotel in washington is not in violation of federal conflict of interest rules that bar elected officials from taking part in a lease of federal property, the u.s. general services administration said on thursday. critics argued that the luxury hotel housed in the historic old post office a few blocks from the white house was a conflict of interest for republican president donald trump because he is both landlord and tenant of the building. lawyers for the hotel said the claim had no merit. democratic lawmakers asked the gsa, which oversees federal property, to clarify the status of the lease arrangement. “we would like to thank the gsa for their diligent review of this matter,” amanda miller, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said in an email.  in january, trump said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire, but hand control to his two oldest sons while president. his eldest son, donald trump jr., subsequently took the reins of the washington hotel. in a letter from gsa contracting officer kevin terry to donald trump jr., the agency said the issue had been resolved by the younger trump taking over as head of the company that runs the hotel and by changes to its internal operating agreement. the gsa said the company, the trump old post office llc, was in full compliance with the section of the lease prohibiting elected federal officials from having any part of it. the hotel on pennsylvania avenue has become a rallying point for anti trump protesters. two democratic u.s. congressmen, elijah cummings of maryland and peter defazio of oregon, voiced displeasure with the gsa decision. “any elected official can now defy the restriction by following this blueprint,” they said in an email statement, calling the agency’s letter “completely inadequate.” “this decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so donald trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the white house,” they added. “this is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent.”  a washington restaurant sued the president and trump old post office llc this month, claiming patrons had shifted business there to curry favor with his administration. a trump organization attorney said the lawsuit lacked merit.

"this ex-ice agent reminds us of how ridiculous jill stein s  cherry-picked  3 state vote recount effort really is. meanwhile, the left and the leftist media completely ignore states like ca, where illegal aliens rioted against trump and anyone who supported him, before and after the election over fear of deportation or loss of taxpayer funded benefits. ca was largely responsible for hillary s slight edge in the popular vote. without california s lopsided votes for hillary, trump would have won the popular vote by a large margin.a california state bill was just signed in to law in october, 2015, by gov. jerry brown, that registers and allows illegal aliens to vote in us elections. the motor voter act (a.b.1461) automatically registers residents of california to vote at the dmv. according to the law and a report by the washington times, the new motor voter act automatically registers to vote all eligible voters when they obtain or renew their drivers licenses at the department of motor vehicles instead of requiring them to fill out a form. the goal is to ease barriers to voting, but election-integrity advocates warn that the measure could inadvertently add millions of illegal voters to the rolls given that california allows undocumented aliens to obtain drivers licenses.   california state officials are praising the law and alex padilla, california s secretary of state says,  citizens should not be required to opt in to their fundamental right to vote.  we do not have to opt in to other rights, such as free speech or due process.  the right to vote should be no different.  state assemblywoman lorena gonzalez from san diego said,  this bill will lead to millions more registered california voters, which means more people we can talk to. critics of the law have called it for what it really is.  absolute and complete voter fraud and corruption on a grand scale.  stephen frank from california political review issued a statement saying,  a.b. 1461 assures corruption of our elections.  our elections will look like those of mexico and other corrupt nations and honest people will stop voting, since illegals will out vote them.   linda paine of the elections integrity project says,  citizens must oppose this treasonous attempt to turn california into a form of government that gives control to non-citizens. -raw conservativewhen trump tweeted about illegal aliens affecting the outcome of the vote, specifically in ca, politfact was quick to accuse him of being dishonest:grabbing the attention of the golden state, president-elect donald trump claimed in a recent tweet there was  serious voter fraud  in three states won by hillary clinton during the general election, including california.trump made this claim on sunday during a flood of tweets about voter fraud. the president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for  the millions of people who voted illegally.  politifact national examined that claim and rated it pants on fire.we decided to fact-check trump s eye-opening claim about  serious voter fraud  in california.our researchtrump offered no evidence about california voter fraud in his series of tweets. his allegations are completely unfounded,  california secretary of state alex padilla said in an interview.  i think it s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. if anything, a message back to mr. trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. but as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades. padilla s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it s received for this and past general elections.hillary clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over trump as of nov. 28, a margin that s grown substantially as california continues to count the state s many absentee ballots. broad brush allegations dean logan, president of the california association of clerks and election officials and the top elections official in los angeles county, said in a statement responding to trump s tweets, that the state has  a history of accurate and accountable elections. logan described trump s voter fraud claims as  broad brush allegations. logan added in an email to politifact california that:  quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track.  that alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other. he added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter s eligibility. but none were used before or after the election, he said. and i think that sort of goes to the point that there s nothing to back up those allegations,  logan said.trump s unsupported claim about voter fraud in california may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: ab 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver s licenses; and the new motor voter act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver s license.  politifact ca",1

" democrat hillary clinton went on the attack against rival bernie sanders on thursday in their most contentious presidential debate yet, questioning whether his ambitious proposals were viable and accusing him of an “artful smear” in suggesting she could be bought by political donations. sanders fought back repeatedly, questioning clinton’s progressive credentials and portraying her as a creature of the political establishment in a debate that featured heated exchanges on healthcare, college tuition funding and efforts to rein in wall street. the intensity reflected a race that has seen clinton’s once prohibitive lead in polls shrivel against sanders as the two vie for the democratic nomination for the nov. 8 election. one of clinton’s most forceful remarks came in response to a suggestion by sanders that she could be influenced by political donations by wall street.  “enough is enough. if you’ve got something to say, say it directly,” she said. “but you will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that i ever received. “so i think it’s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out,” she said. clinton charged that sanders’ proposal for single payer universal healthcare coverage would jeopardize obamacare, calling it “a great mistake,” and said his plans for free college education would be too costly to be realistic. “i can get things done. i’m not making promises i can’t keep,” clinton said. sanders said he would not dismantle obamacare but would expand it, pointing to the many other countries that provide universal healthcare. “i do not accept the belief that the united states of america can’t do that,” sanders said. “by moving forward, rallying the american people, i do believe we should have healthcare for all.” sanders said his proposal for free tuition at public universities would be paid with a tax on wall street speculation. “the middle class bailed out wall street in their time of need. now, it is wall street’s time to help the middle class,” he said. five days before new hampshire holds the second of the state by state presidential nominating contests, opinion polls show sanders, a u.s. senator from neighboring vermont, with a double digit lead over clinton after surprising the front runner by finishing just barely behind her in iowa on monday. clinton seemed energized by her underdog status in new hampshire, delivering her most aggressive debate performance of the campaign. it was reminiscent of her 2008 run against barack obama, when she also began as the front runner but became a sharper and less cautious candidate as she began to lose. the debate was the first since former maryland governor martin o’malley dropped out on monday after a poor finish in iowa, giving the two candidates more freedom to directly engage each other. sanders accused clinton of representing “the establishment,” while saying he represented “ordinary working americans.” he also noted her super pac had taken contributions from wall street firms and that clinton received big speaking fees from goldman sachs. clinton disputed the establishment label, saying it was “quite amusing” to accuse “a woman, running to be the first woman president, as the establishment.” the two battled over who best represented progressive ideals. sanders said he would lead a “political revolution,” but clinton questioned his ability to get his proposals through a republican led congress. “a progressive is someone who makes progress,” she said. and she attacked sanders’ own credentials as a progressive, bringing up his votes against the 1993 brady bill that mandated federal background checks on gun purchases and his 2005 vote for a bill to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. “if we’re going to get into labels, i don’t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the brady bill five times,” she said. “i don’t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.”  sanders repeated his earlier pledge not to attack clinton on the controversy over her use of a private email account and a private server for government business when she was secretary of state. “i will not politicize it,” he said. but sanders renewed his attacks on clinton for her senate vote to authorize the u.s. invasion of iraq, which she has since called a mistake. he pointed out he voted against the war, which he said had led to the rise of the islamic state militant group. “look we did differ,” clinton responded. “a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis. “we have to look at the threats that we face right now.” clinton has tried to play down expectations for her performance in new hampshire, where she came from behind for an upset victory in the 2008 campaign just days after losing badly to obama in iowa. the surprisingly strong performance by sanders in iowa is likely to prolong a race that clinton entered as the presumptive front runner. in addition to previously scheduled debates in wisconsin and florida, the candidates added one in march in flint, michigan, to draw attention to the city’s contaminated water crisis ahead of the michigan primary. they also will debate in april and may.

" deadly ethnic fighting in central african republic could descend into a much larger scale conflict if nothing is done to disarm combatants and defuse tensions, a u.n. report said on friday. with a fifth of the population displaced since the mainly muslim seleka rebels ousted the president in 2013, provoking a backlash from christian anti balaka militias, u.n. peacekeepers are struggling to contain simmering violence. the u.n. human rights working group on mercenaries and foreign fighters said it  strongly senses that the possibility of another armed conflict is likely, if foreign armed actors, along with local armed groups, are not effectively dismantled and suppressed.  national security forces are too weak to tackle armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries, and u.n. military personnel, who number just over 10,000, have failed to convince locals that they can protect them, the report said. ugandan and u.s. forces pulled out earlier this year,  declaring  success  against the lord s resistance army, a regional militia notorious for two decades of abducting children to use as fighters and sex slaves. on thursday, amnesty international issued its own report detailing what it said was the systematic rape and murder of civilians in ethnic fighting.       if the u.n. s mandate in the central african republic is to mean anything, civilians must be better protected,  the rights group s joanne mariner said. u.n. peacekeeping chief jean pierre lacroix said the u.n. mission in central african republic (minusca) had to make changes and was  slightly  short of the necessary personnel.  we have currently a troop ceiling which we think is slightly under what we would need,  he said on friday. minusca s mandate authorizes it to have 10,750 military personnel, a recent u.n. report said there were 10,098 on the ground.      we are seeing a surge in ... very negative and antagonistic messages to the effect that  foreigners  should be eliminated, putting one ethnic or religious component of this country against the other,  lacroix told reporters in geneva.  the working group report said the word  foreigners  was constantly used to label muslims.

" twenty four hours after spain removed him from power, catalonia s leader had resolved to leave the country and take his independence campaign to the heart of the european union, but first he needed to tie off an important loose end. carles puigdemont s secessionist alliance was threatening to unravel, with the region s biggest grass roots independence organization unhappy about his plan. so he called a meeting of political allies on the eve of his departure for brussels, according to three sources with first hand knowledge of the events. in the rural hamlet of vilahur, near puigdemont s home town, he and seven others, including the deputy chief of the grass roots catalan national assembly (anc), met over dinner at a farmhouse in the expectation puigdemont and others present would be arrested for rebellion within hours, one source said. puigdemont told the group he was not running away from a fight, as anc officials feared it would be perceived, and that he would use brussels, home to the eu parliament and commission, as a stage to continue to speak out against spain s crackdown on the independence movement, the source added. after adjourning for the night, the group resumed the next morning at the farmhouse and agreed to back his plan. crucially, that plan also included a commitment to contest snap regional elections called by madrid for dec. 21 rather than boycott them as the anc first envisaged.   on reaching agreement, puigdemont told them he was prepared to  spend 30 years in prison  for the cause and the others embraced him in what the source described as an emotional farewell. anc deputy leader agusti alcoberro was among them.   the account of the meeting reveals how the independence movement s leadership managed to overcome deep rooted internal divisions and agree a rough game plan for the weeks ahead. while the two main pro independence parties finally chose on tuesday to contest the elections under their own brand rather than a joint ticket, their manifestos will be coordinated and they are still expected to join forces after the vote.   an opinion poll this week showed that pro independence parties would win the largest share of the vote, though a majority was not assured and question marks remain over puigdemont s leadership of the pro independence cause. puigdemont could not be reached for comment.  wrong footed at the time of the vilahur talks, prime minister mariano rajoy seemed to hold the upper hand. he had surprised the secessionists by calling elections much sooner than they had expected, according to sources close to puigdemont. a disparate collection of parties whose only common thread is independence, puigdemont s coalition had been bickering over what some saw as his timid tactics. some had even been talking of boycotting the election, which could have spelled the end of the movement.  he was wrong footed by rajoy s tough response,  said an  ally of puigdemont. when rajoy dropped his election bombshell, puigdemont was still celebrating the regional assembly s vote earlier that day to declare catalonia a republic. the catalan leader had to move quickly to secure consensus for the brussels plan and, more importantly, for his unwieldy coalition to contest the elections, which had been called by a nation they no longer considered themselves to be a part of. in puigdemont s first meeting late on oct. 27, in barcelona s regional parliament building, the coalition decided that only a few ministers would go with him to brussels and the rest would stay and defend themselves against any prosecution for sedition, said sources briefed on that meeting. afterwards, he drove to girona, the town he had run as mayor. in a courtyard of a government building, he filmed a message calling for non violent opposition to rajoy s takeover of the region. it was televised by catalan public broadcaster tv3 which called him  president . later, he lunched with his wife and two friends at a local wine bar and walked with them to girona s placa de la independencia (independence square) where he posed for photos while applauding onlookers shouted  long live catalonia . despite the defiant scene, the day was not going well for the newly declared catalan republic. rajoy was receiving backing from world powers including france, germany and the united states. spanish authorities were already taking over catalan government offices. however, puigdemont got some news that appeared to justify his brussels strategy just as he and four of his ex ministers were making their way there. belgium s migration minister, theo francken, said that if puigdemont were to seek political asylum in belgium, it would be  not unrealistic  to grant it. belgium is one of few eu states where eu citizens can request asylum. francken belongs to flemish nationalist party n va, which  is supportive of catalan self determination. he said no asylum request had yet been made but events were  moving fast . puigdemont was meanwhile in a friend s car heading for marseilles, southern france, where he would board a flight to brussels. to elude spanish police, someone drove his official car in a different direction. since arriving in brussels, puigdemont and the four ex ministers who accompanied him there have been slapped with european arrest warrants for rebellion and sedition, crimes carrying up to 30 years in jail. back in spain, eight other ex ministers have been jailed pending an investigation and potential trial for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. puigdemont has not sought asylum but is at liberty in belgium pending a hearing on extradition, which his lawyer has said he will oppose.

" u.s. president donald trump called hurricane irma  some big monster  as it battered the florida coast, saying he wanted to go to the state very soon and praising emergency officials for their efforts to protect people.  the bad news is that this is some big monster,  trump told reporters at the white house, saying damage from the storm would be very costly.  right now, we are worried about lives, not cost,  trump said after returning from camp david, the presidential retreat in maryland where he monitored the storm and met with his cabinet. the path of the storm, tracking the west coast of florida, meant it might be less destructive than it would otherwise have been, trump said, noting the next five or six hours would be critical.  i hope there aren t too many people in the path,  he said.  you don t want to be in that path.   the u.s. house of representatives canceled votes scheduled for monday because of the hurricane. trump said the u.s. coast guard had been heroic and that the federal emergency management agency was doing a good job to help coordinate the response with states. he added, however:  i think the hard part is now beginning.  trump has offered the full resources of the federal government to florida and the affected states, vice president mike pence told reporters during a visit to fema s washington headquarters on sunday.  wherever hurricane irma goes, we ll be there first,  pence said.  we ll be there with resources and support, both to save lives and to help to recover and rebuild these states and these communities.  on sunday, trump also issued a disaster declaration for the u.s. territory of puerto rico, and expanded federal funds available to the u.s. virgin islands in the aftermath of irma, the white house said. trump owns a resort in palm beach, florida, where he has often traveled during his presidency, as well as three golf courses in the state. he told reporters he hoped to travel to the state soon.  we re going to florida very soon,  trump said.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he supported efforts to quickly act on legislation to impose new sanctions on russia and iran that passed the senate nearly unanimously but has stalled in the house. republican representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, “has indicated he wants to get moving on this quickly, and we want to honor that,” ryan said at his weekly news conference. the countering iran’s destabilizing activities act, which also includes new sanctions against russia, passed the senate 98 2 last week, a vote that looked like it might complicate president donald trump’s desire for warmer relations with moscow. the measure must pass the house before it can be sent to trump to sign into law or veto. the house parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the house, something known as a “blue slip” violation. democrats said they were skeptical about the explanation, noting that previous “blue slip” issues had been resolved in a matter of minutes. kevin brady, the republican chairman of the house ways and means committee, told reporters he had sent the senate a solution clearing the way for it to take the bill back, change it and move it forward. ben cardin, ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, told reuters the change did not appear to substantively alter the legislation and that staff was reviewing it to determine how to move ahead. senior senate democratic aides said any bill involving sanctions or fines could be interpreted as affecting u.s. revenues. trump’s fellow republicans hold a larger majority in the house than in the senate. some lawmakers and congressional aides said the white house was concerned about a provision that would require trump to obtain congress’ approval before easing any sanctions on russia. secretary of state rex tillerson urged congress last week to ensure that any sanctions package would give trump the flexibility to adjust sanctions. white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration would not take a position before the bill advanced through the house. however, he acknowledged the white house needed to work with congress on some areas of the measure. ryan said he did not yet know if it would go through the formal markup debate and amendment process. democrats have said that process could delay the bill for months. asked if he supported the policy in the bill, ryan said he supported sanctions.

" u.s. republican senator marco rubio reluctantly backed president donald trump’s nominee for secretary of state, rex tillerson, in a move that all but secures senate confirmation of the former exxon mobil corp chief executive as the nation’s top diplomat later on monday.  rubio said he was troubled by tillerson’s recent responses before lawmakers regarding russia as well as other countries, but that he ultimately decided he would vote to approve the nominee in deference to trump, as well as to fill a critical top job. “despite my reservations, i will support mr. tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full senate,” rubio said in a statement ahead of the senate foreign relations committee’s vote on tillerson.  a vote in the republican controlled senate was expected shortly after the committee vote. tillerson was expected to win confirmation, despite opposition from democrats.  rubio, a onetime rival to trump for the republican presidential nomination, said he would not be so deferential regarding trump’s other nominees for top state department posts.   at a confirmation hearing earlier this month, tillerson’s views appeared to be at odds with trump’s on key foreign policy issues such as nuclear proliferation, trade deals, climate change and relations with mexico. the nominee also had a tense exchange with rubio on whether he believed russian president vladimir putin was a war criminal, in reference to russia’s military actions in support of syria’s government. tillerson said he would not use that term.  tillerson, 64, also sidestepped questions on human rights, declining to condemn countries like saudi arabia and the philippines for rights abuses.    over the weekend, fellow republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham said they would back tillerson despite their concerns over his relationship with putin as ceo of one of the world’s largest corporations.     republican senator rob portman on monday also voiced his support and said he was reassured by tillerson’s commitment at the jan. 11 hearing to support nato, an organization that trump has voiced differing opinions about. earlier on monday, the most senior democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, ben cardin, said he would not support tillerson. “the power of the secretary of state to call out wrong, to name and shame, and to fight each day on behalf of the american people and freedom seeking people the world over is an enduring symbol,” cardin said in a prepared statement.

" germany s highest court ruled on wednesday in favor of the introduction of a third gender category for people who do not identify as either male or female or are born with an ambiguous sexual anatomy. the federal constitutional court called on lawmakers to enact legislation by the end of 2018 to either allow the introduction of a third category or dispense with gender altogether in civil status documents. in 2013, germany became the first european country to recognize indeterminate sex by allowing babies born with no clear gender determining anatomy to be put on the birth register without a male or female classification. wednesday s decision overturned a ruling by a lower court last year in a case brought by a german citizen born in 1989, identified as vanja by the third option campaign group that supported the plaintiff in the case. the lower court said it was not possible to be registered as third gender because vanja could leave the gender identity blank. however, the federal constitutional court said germany s basic law, or constitution, protected the personality rights of individuals who do not define themselves as male or female, adding that the current law on civil status interfered with that right.  the basic law does not require that civil status be exclusively binary in terms of gender,  the court said in a statement. the third option group described the ruling as  historic , but said it is only the  first step on improving the situation of inter and transgender people .  finally it s recognized by the federal constitutional court that there are more genders than man or woman,  said mortiz schmidt, the spokesman of the group. antke engel, the director of the institute of queer theory in berlin, said she was impressed that ruling gave lawmakers the possibility of dropping the gender category altogether.   of course that would be the more radical version,  engel said. jamie zulauf, a 30 year old medical student who identifies as transgender, welcomed the move but said it could mean new problems when traveling to countries where a third gender is not accepted.   it s going to be visible and it s not always safe to be visible,  jamie said. the government in berlin estimated in 2013 there were 8,000 to 10,000 intersex people in germany but interest groups say the number could be closer to 80,000.

" president emmanuel macron may have won the first round of his battle to overhaul france s economy, but the coming 10 days promise to bring far more protests and unrest to the streets as labor unions and the political left step up their opposition. last week s demonstration by the communist party linked cgt union against changes to the labor code drew many fewer protesters than expected, with police saying 220,000 people turned out nationwide, against union estimates of 400,000. despite opposition, the government will adopt the labor reform, which simplifies employment rules and makes hiring and firing easier, on sept. 22. but even if that battle may be lost for the unions, many workers, retirees, civil servants and youth are not giving up as they look warily toward macron s longer term plans to overhaul the unemployment benefit and pensions systems as well. jean luc melenchon, head of the left wing la france insoumise (france unbowed) party, who sees himself as the main voice of opposition, has described macron s proposals as a  social coup d etat . he is calling for a mass march on paris by the party s 530,000 mostly young members on sept. 23. on monday, truck drivers belonging to the cfdt union, the largest in the country although politically more centrist, blocked some highways, including in the busy pas de calais area in the northeast, to protest the labor code changes.   today is a warning,  patrick blaise, secretary general of cfdt s truck drivers, told le parisien newspaper.  if they don t listen to us, cfdt s truckers won t stop there.  on sept. 21, the cgt union is calling for another round of nationwide protests and on sept. 25 truck drivers belonging to cgt and force ouvriere, the third largest union, will begin rolling strikes, including targeting petrol stations. keeping the pressure on, union groups are calling on retirees to demonstrate on sept. 28 against increases to social charges, which in france are applied to a variety of income sources and used to fund health care and welfare.  we don t intend to wait until the pension reform proposals to act,  said fabrice angei, a senior cgt official.  we need to put an end to the destruction of our social model.  while macron, 39, has seen his approval rating slump since his resounding election victory in may, he shows no sign of diluting his ambitious plans to retool the economy, including bringing down unemployment stuck above 9 percent for a decade. but both he and prime minister edouard philippe acknowledge that the changes to the labor code are just the first step in a long program, with the other measures likely to provoke much greater opposition and cause more social disruption.  this second phase is going to take longer than the current one,  philippe said last week.  behind these reforms isn t only the desire to relaunch the economy,  he said.  it s about our collective ability to be a country that acts decisively.

" retired lieutenant general michael flynn, who has been advising donald trump informally on foreign policy, will join drone aviation holding corp as vice chairman of its board of directors, the company said in a statement on wednesday. flynn, who was chief of the defense intelligence agency under president barack obama from 2012 2014 and has since been advising trump, the republican presidential front runner, wants the united states to work more closely with russia to resolve global security issues. “having evaluated the (company’s) technologies, i believe they can positively impact our military’s defense and situational awareness and that is why i am joining jay and his team in expanding the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace,” flynn said in the statement, referring to company ceo jay nussbaum.  drone aviation develops and manufactures aerostats and electric powered drones to give its customers “enhanced surveillance and communication capabilities.” the company’s customers include the u.s. military, saudi arabia and the ecuadorian air force, according to its website. flynn resigned as the head of the pentagon’s main intelligence agency a year before his term was officially due to end. he raised eyebrows among some u.s. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with russian president vladimir putin at a banquet in moscow late last year celebrating russia today, an international broadcasting network funded by the russian government. he told russia today in an interview published on dec. 10 that the united states and russia should work together to resolve the syrian civil war and defeat the islamic state militant group. flynn’s experience would “help ensure that our tethered solutions, today and in the future, will continue to meet the needs of our soldiers and security forces at home and abroad as they respond to evolving threats,” nussbaum said in the same statement.

" thousands of assault rifles and helmets were among the military gear russia donated to the philippines in a bid to widen its arms market in southeast asia at a time when manila is seeking to diversify weapons systems, officials said on wednesday. manila received about 5,000 kalashnikov rifles, 5,000 steel helmets, about a million rounds of ammunition for the rifles and 20 army trucks in a ceremony attended by president rodrigo duterte, who also toured one of five visiting russian warships. the gift came a day after russia and the philippines signed two military pacts, including a sales contract with rosoboronexport, a state owned vendor of russian defense equipment.    we are looking at acquiring some equipment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, but there are no specifics yet,  defense secretary delfin lorenzana told reuters.  we are still discussing.  lorenzana said the rosoboronexport contract was not a sales deal but signaled the philippines  intention to acquire small arms, vehicles and special equipment for disaster operations. but the philippines  biggest source of arms, the united states, was not worried at the prospect of equipment donated by its rivals china and russia.  i don t attach very much significance to it, some trucks or guns being dropped off to a country that s fighting terrorists right now,  u.s. defense secretary jim mattis told reporters on the plane to bangkok.  it s a sovereign decision by the philippines,  he added.  so it s not a big issue...other nations are coming to their help.  the united states and china dominate regional arms trade.  since 2000, the united states has donated close to $1 billion worth of military equipment to the philippines, ranging from surveillance planes, drones and boats to small arms.  china, which promised to donate a third shipment of small arms after a meeting on wednesday between lorenzana and his chinese counterpart, general chang wanquan, has already given the philippines about $7 million in small arms.   the deals with the philippines will allow russia to expand its arms market in the region, said another senior philippine official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.  the philippines is now open to buying russian arms as manila cultivates closer ties with moscow, he added, particularly as the military looks to diversify its equipment, reining in costs while maintaining quality.  moscow has been offering to sell arms to us since the mid 1990s and they are willing to barter guns for bananas,  he said, adding that russia was selling fighters, helicopters and submarines to the philippines.

" russia s communications regulator on friday accused u.s. tv channel cnn international of violating russian media law and said it had summoned the broadcaster s representatives in connection with the matter. the russian foreign ministry accused washington on thursday of putting unwarranted pressure on the u.s operations of kremlin backed media outlet rt, and warned that moscow could take tit for tat measures. president vladimir putin told a meeting of russia s security council on friday that russian media outlets working abroad were facing growing and unacceptable pressure, his spokesman dmitry peskov said. the communications regulator, roskomnadzor, said in a statement on its website that it would look at warning cnn about the alleged violations, which it said also breached the terms of its broadcast license. it did not say what breaches of russian laws the u.s. broadcaster had made, adding it would continue its  systematic monitoring  of foreign mass media outlets registered in russia. asked if the regulator s move was politically motivated, roskomnadzor head alexander zharov, was quoted by interfax news agency as saying:  i don t work in a political agency. i work in a regulatory service.   russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said on thursday the u.s. authorities were demanding that russian state controlled broadcaster russia today (rt) be registered as a  foreign agent  in the united states. she said that move endangered the safety of the channel s staff, because it included an obligation to disclose their personal data.  in the atmosphere of a witch hunt unfolding in the united states, this may present a real threat,  she said. putin, meeting permanent members of his security council,  touched upon the issue of ongoing and at times growing pressure on russian mass media outlets in some foreign countries , peskov told a conference call with reporters.  it was stressed that such pressure on russian media is unacceptable,  he added. he did not name the countries where the kremlin was concerned russian media were coming under pressure.    the foreign ministry s zakharova said any move made against russian media working in the united states  will get a tit for tat response .  and who it falls on, this should be easy for washington to work out. the clock is ticking,  she said at a weekly briefing on thursday.

" a second prototype of china s home built c919 passenger jet took off for a test flight in shanghai on sunday, state television reported, another step forward in the country s ambitions to muscle in to the global jet market. a total of six prototypes will eventually conduct test flights, china central television reported, with engine tests to be a particular focus. the aim was to conduct another long distance test flight in late january, chief engineer wang wei was quoted as saying. more than 1,000 tests would be carried out. the narrow body aircraft, which will compete with boeing s 737 and the airbus a320, is a symbol of china s ambitions to penetrate the global passenger jet market, estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. the c919 made its maiden flight on may 5 after numerous delays. analysts have questioned the long periods between previous test flights. it completed its first long distance flight on nov. 10, flying for 2 hours and 23 minutes from shanghai to the central chinese city of xi an, covering more than 1,300 km (800 miles) and reaching an altitude of 7,800 meters (25,590 feet). its manufacturer, the commercial aircraft corp of china ltd (comac) [cmafc.ul], called the maiden flight a milestone that  marked the plane s move into an airworthiness certification phase. comac is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from chinese regulators as well as europe s aviation safety regulator, which agreed in april to start the certification process. the plane has dozens of customers who have placed orders and commitments for 785 jets, comac has said.

" a u.s. judge on tuesday blocked president donald trump’s latest bid to impose restrictions on citizens from several countries entering the united states, which would have taken effect this week.   the open ended ban, announced last month, targeted people from iran, libya, syria, yemen, somalia, chad and north korea, as well as certain government officials from venezuela. it was the third version of a policy that had previously targeted some muslim majority countries but had been restricted by the courts.  tuesday’s ruling sets up another high stakes battle over trump’s executive authority which legal experts expect will ultimately land in the u.s. supreme court. trump’s first travel ban in january caused chaos and protests at u.s. airports before judges halted it. the state of hawaii sued to block trump’s latest travel restrictions, arguing that federal immigration law did not give him the authority to impose them on six of those countries. hawaii did not challenge entry restrictions relating to north korea and venezuela. u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu said hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that trump’s latest travel ban violates federal immigration law. the policy “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be ‘detrimental to the interests of the united states,’” watson wrote. the white house in a statement said the ruling was  “dangerously flawed” and that it was confident the courts would ultimately uphold trump’s policy.  “these restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our nation,” the statement said. the justice department called watson’s ruling “incorrect” and said it would appeal “in an expeditious manner.”  following the ruling, the u.s. state department instructed embassies and consulates around the world to “resume regular processing of visas” for citizens of chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen, a department official said on condition of anonymity. the department will carry out the proclamation for north korea and venezuela “with the objective of maximizing national security,” the official said, because the order did not apply to  restrictions on those countries. as a candidate, trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” in announcing the newest travel restrictions, the white house had portrayed them as necessary consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. those requirements were shared in july with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the white house said. a number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. others did not, sparking the restrictions. immigrant advocacy groups cheered the hawaii ruling.  “we’re glad, but not surprised, that president trump’s illegal and unconstitutional muslim ban has been blocked once again,” omar jadwat, director of the american civil liberties union immigrants rights project, said in a statement. the aclu and other groups have filed separate challenges to trump’s policy in a maryland federal court. a ruling is still pending. in the hawaii case, the judge said that the ban’s national security rationale was undermined by not knowing how the president settled on the countries designated by the ban.  the judge also said the proclamation likely runs afoul of a prohibition in immigration law on nationality based discrimination in issuing visas. watson had blocked trump’s second travel ban in march. in a statement on tuesday, hawaii attorney general doug chin said: “today is another victory for the rule of law.” kiyanoush razaghi, an immigration attorney with the catholic legal immigration network who has many iranian clients, said  iranians still have problems when applying for u.s. visas, including particularly lengthy wait times for security checks. razaghi said he has told his clients: “you can celebrate, there is no travel ban right now, but be careful because that doesn’t mean you are going to get a visa in a reasonable amount of time.” ",0
" two aging holocaust survivors joined forces with a younger israeli singer to perform songs of hope at berlin s brandenburg gate on wednesday at a time when germany is seeing a rise in anti semitism. saul dreier, a drummer aged 92, and reuwen  ruby  sosnowicz, an 89 year old accordionist, backed up gad elbaz at a site once used by adolf hitler for anti semitic speeches.  i don t want to cry. if i can be 92 and be here after what i went through   there are no words,  dreier told reuters at the end of a long and emotional day      this is a miracle. i lost 30 people in my family,  he told a crowd of around 80 people before the performance. dreier said recent news of neo nazi marches in the united states and germany made him sick and brought back memories of the horrors of the nazi regime that killed 6 million jews.  it s very frightening. young people have to make sure it never happens again.  the men, who both live in florida, formed their  holocaust survivors band  in 2014 and went on to play in front of packed audiences from warsaw and las vegas to washington, d.c.  elbaz said the event in berlin was meant to make sure younger people remained vigilant about the dangers of anti semitism.  this is about reviving history and showing our generation how important it is not to forget where we came from, what we ve been through, and that it should never happen again,  he said. organizers plan to release a music video filmed during the performance of one of the songs,  let the light shine on . shani ramer, 48, who was born in israel but grew up and lives in berlin, said the concert reminded her of family members who perished.  it touched my heart,  she said. she welcomed the concert s message of hope.  it s saying we are still here. no one will kill us now.  abida ali, a muslim tourist visiting germany from pakistan, joined other bystanders dancing to the upbeat music. ali said she had experienced no discrimination during her visit despite her head scarf.  it s only a small percentage of the people who are violent,  she said.  there is hope. everyone really wants peace.  a study by bielefeld university carried out last year showed that 78 percent of jews living in germany believe anti semitism has increased to some extent, or to a large extent, in the previous five years.

" republicans in the house of representatives are preparing legal action in case president barack obama tries to transfer detainees at the military prison at guantanamo bay to the united states, house speaker paul ryan said on wednesday. ryan told reporters it would be against the law for obama to bring detainees from the prison in cuba to the united states, because it would violate a ban on such transfers passed by congress in 2015. he was speaking a day after the president, seeking to make good on a pledge he made in 2008 before he was first elected to the white house, launched a final push to persuade congress to close the military prison for foreign terrorism suspects. the pentagon authored plan proposes 13 potential sites on u.s. soil to hold some 30 to 60 detainees in maximum security prisons. obama is also considering taking executive action to close guantanamo, situated at a u.s. naval station in southeast cuba, if congress does not drop its opposition. “our law is really clear,” ryan told reporters after a meeting of house republicans. “these detainees cannot come to american soil.”  “we are making legal preparations if the president tries to break the law,” ryan said. “and what boggles my mind is that the president is contemplating directing the military to knowingly break the law.”  the speaker said that obama is trying to extend the president’s executive authority beyond its limits of the u.s. constitution. ryan added that not only republicans but also many in obama’s own democratic party oppose detainee transfers to u.s. soil. democrats accused house republicans of wasting taxpayer dollars on litigation. in recent years the house republican majority has spent nearly $3 million in this way, said drew hammill, a spokesman for house democratic leader nancy pelosi. house republicans have spent $189,498 since november 2014 on litigation challenging the administration’s obamacare healthcare program, and recently agreed to spend up to $150,000 on legal advice on the possible guantanamo litigation, pelosi’s office said. a spokesman for ryan, brendan buck, defended the spending, saying “we wouldn’t have to spend so much money if the president wasn’t overreaching.” pelosi’s office said that under former house speaker john boehner, house republicans spent $2.5 million defending a law that denied federal benefits to same sex couples, before the language was struck down by the supreme court.

" u.s. treasury secretary jack lew on monday called on the senate to take immediate action this week to address puerto rico’s $70 billion debt crisis before the critical july 1 deadline for the island territory’s next debt payments. “the senate should take up the matter immediately,” lew said in a letter to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. “delay will only jeopardize the ability of congress to conclude its work before july 1, a critical deadline puerto rico’s leadership has publicly highlighted for months.” if no action is taken, the crisis there will only ratchet higher, he said in the letter. puerto rico faces a deadline on friday to pay off $2 billion of its debts. senator james inhofe of oklahoma, chairman of the senate environment and public works committee, said later in a floor speech that the vote would take place on wednesday. “i really do think that we can go ahead and support the bill,” he said.  a senior republican aide could not confirm that a vote would take place on wednesday.    the financially ailing island is staring down $70 billion worth of debt that it says it cannot repay in full, adding to its 45 percent poverty rate and rising emigration to the u.s. mainland that is also cutting into its economic growth. the republican led u.s. house of representatives already passed legislation to address puerto rico’s debt before leaving washington for the july 4 holiday break. the senate is expected to recess at the end of this week. the house bill, a rare piece of bipartisan legislation,  would establish a federal oversight board to negotiate various debt restructurings while seeking to institute balanced budgets on the island, a u.s. territory with 3.5 million residents. lew called on senators to also pass the house measure   the “puerto rico oversight, management and economic stability act,” or promesa   this week to get it to president barack obama to sign into law before friday’s payment deadline. the senate, also controlled by republicans, is expected to debate the measure this week, but democrats have said they want changes   a move that could complicate its passage. a vote is expected this week.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson delivered a message of support to european allies in brussels on tuesday but their concerns about president donald trump’s foreign policy have created a rift on a host of issues. european allies are troubled by trump’s “america first” rhetoric, his decision not to certify iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, his withdrawal from the paris climate accord and now plans to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem.  tillerson told europe’s foreign ministers at the european union and nato that the u.s. government remains committed to transatlantic ties that trump has previously questioned.  tillerson also sought to reassure u.s. diplomats posted abroad that his ideas to revamp the country’s foreign service were bearing fruit, saying he would reveal a modernization plan for the u.s. state department soon. tillerson, the former chief executive of exxon mobil, said his visit showed “the strong commitment the u.s. has to the european alliance, the important role that the european alliance plays in our shared security objectives.” before a lunch with eu foreign ministers, tillerson stressed “shared values, shared objectives for security and prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.” trump visited the u.s. led nato alliance in may to admonish european leaders on their low defense spending. during his visit on tuesday, tillerson offered a more generous appraisal and gave an “unwavering” u.s. commitment to nato’s mutual defense clause, which considers an attack on one ally as an attack on all. tillerson ignored questions from reporters about whether he would be ousted from the white house, while his senior adviser r.c. hammond said no eu or nato foreign ministers raised the issue of whether tillerson’s job was secure. in his first substantive public comments since reports last week of a white house plan for cia director mike pompeo to replace him, tillerson said despite “a little criticism”, he was on top of his job. “while we don’t have any wins on the board yet, i can tell you we’re in a much better position to advance america’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” he told senior u.s. diplomats and u.s. embassy staff at the u.s. mission to belgium in brussels.  tillerson’s trip will also take him to vienna and paris. while trump said last week he was not leaving and tillerson said the reports were untrue,, trump has also said he alone determines u.s. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on friday: “i call the final shots.”  tillerson told u.s. diplomats gathered at the embassy in belgium that it had been “a bit of a shock” to meet trump for the first time when he was approached as a possible secretary of state late last year.   diplomats said eu governments face a dilemma because tillerson’s views are more closely aligned with theirs but may not reflect those of trump. foreign ministers had been open about sharing disagreements with the united states on various issues, hammond said. one eu diplomat said it was “fairly predictable” given tensions on issues, including trump’s handling of the north korea nuclear crisis and his threat to “totally destroy” the secretive country. “allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” hammond said, although he said it was important to be honest, adding that: “dialogues only work if they go two ways.” in a speech in berlin before flying to brussels, german foreign minister sigmar gabriel warned that the european union could no longer rely on the united states as its closest ally. “the withdrawal of the united states under donald trump from its reliable role as a guarantor of western led multilateralism accelerates a change of the world order with immediate consequences for german and european interests,” gabriel said. standing next to tillerson on the podium at the eu headquarters in brussels, eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini also warned the trump administration about a possible plan to the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem. trump is considering recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, which gabriel also said could unleash turmoil. “a lot of member states, including us, are concerned that the recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel will not calm the conflict but rather inflame it,” gabriel said at nato after the eu ministers’ lunch with tillerson. the european union, as the palestinians’ biggest aid donor and israel’s top trade partner, says it has a right to make its voice heard in any u.s. initiatives in the middle east.

" south africa s justice minister michael masutha on friday denied parole to the killer of anti apartheid leader chris hani, saying he had not expressed remorse for the murder. janusz walus has served more than 20 years of a life sentence for the assassination of hani, who was a senior member of the now ruling african national congress (anc) and head of the south african communist party. walus, 64, emigrated from communist poland in 1981 and became involved in far right politics in south africa.  he shot hani outside the anti apartheid activist s home in 1993. the killing triggered nationwide riots that threatened to derail south africa s 1994 transition to multi racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule. masutha also blocked walus  parole application in 2015, a decision that triggered several court challenges. the supreme court of appeal referred the matter back to the justice minister for reconsideration.  masutha said on friday a psychologist s report had highlighted walus  political ideology as a risk factor. the report said walus  expressed remorse for the fact that the victim s children are fatherless and the wife is a widow .  however, he showed no remorse for murdering chris hani. he still rationalizes his actions and insists that they were politically motivated. his ideas about communism still stand.

" takuya yokota vividly remembers clutching a flashlight and running to the ocean with his mother and twin brother to look for his older sister in the dark, shouting her name. megumi, then 13, had disappeared on her way home from school on a cold november day 40 years ago, kidnapped   it emerged decades later   by north korean agents to help train spies. none of them has ever seen her again, one of scores japan believes were snatched away in the 1970s and 80s.  our house was thrust into a bottomless darkness,  yokota, nine at the time, told reuters.  every day after that was silent and hard.  now, as tensions rise after north korean missile launches over japan and nuclear tests, u.s. president donald trump has made megumi s case part of his attacks on pyongyang. he mentioned her in a september speech at the united nations and during his japan visit next week plans to meet her parents and other families whose loved ones were stolen. prime minister shinzo abe has made the abductions a keystone of his political career and said he won t rest until all 13 of those pyongyang admits to kidnapping have returned and divulges information about the others japan suspects were taken. megumi yokota has become the poster child for the cause. but progress has largely stalled since 2002, when five of the 13 returned home. pyongyang said the other eight, including megumi, were dead.  trump is the third u.s. president abductee families have met, following george w. bush and barack obama. yokota hopes the trump meeting will give the issue new life. with abe in charge, megumi s return may be closer, although yokota shows hints of impatience with abe, in office since late 2012.   i d like (abe) to put his reputation and his government on the line and lead this issue to a resolution,  he said. toru hasuike, the brother of abductee kaoru hasuike, one of those who returned to japan, says the trump meeting is merely a nod to abe s conservative base.  this is a performance, making political use of them,  he told reuters, referring to the yokotas.  asking america for help is strange. it s our country, so the japanese government should take responsibility to help them.  raising the issue will generate more awareness, but progress is unlikely, said robert boynton, a journalism professor at new york university and author of a 2016 book on the abductions.  the sad thing is i think the north koreans are playing a waiting game   waiting for people like the yokotas to pass away, that the next generation won t be as exercised and the issue will just go away,  boynton said. takuya yokota hopes to once again meet the older sister who doted on her twin brothers.  i think of her at work, i think of her before i sleep,  he said.  when it gets cold and the snow falls ... i wonder if she s warm enough. i think of this every day.

" illinois’ republican governor, bruce rauner, has ordered lawmakers to return to work starting next wednesday to pass a budget as the clock ticks down to the july 1 start of a new fiscal year. but there is no sign in the democratic led legislature that a breakthrough in the 23 month impasse could be imminent. rauner warned on thursday that the inability to pass a budget could bring “devastating and long lasting ramifications” for the nation’s fifth largest state. those include possible “junk” credit ratings, a halt to state funded road projects, and suspension from national lotteries. illinois is limping toward the june 30 end of an unprecedented second straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between rauner and democratic leaders.  rauner said he would sign into law a bill package unveiled by republican legislators on wednesday that includes a $36 billion budget, a school funding revamp, and several measures he has sought such as a local property tax freeze, term limits for top state officials and cost saving changes to the system that compensates injured workers. the bills require three fifths majority votes for passage instead of a simple majority. “it is a true compromise – and one i hope the majority in the general assembly will accept,” the governor said in a facebook video posted on thursday. rauner and democrats continued to blame each other for the budget crisis. “house democrats will continue our work on the budget from springfield, but as governor rauner has met each of our attempts to date with refusal, it’s clear that the onus is on the governor to show that he is finally serious about working in good faith to end the crisis he has manufactured,” house speaker michael madigan said in a statement. if illinois still lacks a budget when the new fiscal year dawns, the consequences could be big. the state’s credit ratings could sink to “junk,” a first for any u.s. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state’s debt and others to demand even fatter yields. the state will be suspended from participating in the powerball and mega millions lotteries due to the lack of fiscal 2018 appropriations to pay winning ticket holders, illinois lottery spokesman jason schaumburg said. the games have generated about $240 million in sales in illinois so far in fiscal 2017. with no money to pay road contractors, illinois’ transportation department is shutting down about 700 ongoing projects that carry a price tag of $2.3 billion, according to department spokeswoman gianna urgo. the budget impasse has ballooned illinois’ pile of unpaid bills to $15 billion as of wednesday, fueling litigation by unpaid vendors and others. a u.s. judge has set a june 20 deadline for illinois to start paying more of the $2 billion it owes medicaid providers.

" arabs denounced president donald trump s plan to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem as a slap in the face but few thought their governments would do much in response. trump phoned allies in the middle east late on tuesday to tell them the united states would acknowledge jerusalem as the capital of israel on wednesday and prepare to move its embassy there.  it incites feelings of anger among all muslims and threatens world peace,  said sheikh ahmed al tayeb, imam of egypt s al azhar mosque, one of islam s most important institutions.     the gates of hell will be opened in the west before the east,  he added, warning of the possible reaction.  israel s sovereignty over east jerusalem, which it seized in the 1967 war, is not recognized internationally, and under the u.s. brokered oslo accords of 1993 the city s status was to be decided in negotiations with palestinians.  arab governments issued statements of concern or condemnation and emergency meetings of both the arab league and the organisation of islamic cooperation have been called. but the u.s. decision has been taken.    in a bitterly divided region, backing for palestinians is often seen as a unifying position, but it is also often a source of internal recriminations over the extent of that support.  a cartoon in al arabi al jadeed, a london based arabic news website, showed trump raising a hand against an arab as if to slap him, wearing a large glove marked with the israeli flag.   in lebanon, the daily star newspaper ran a full page photograph of jerusalem on its cover with the headline  no offense mr. president, jerusalem is the capital of palestine .  around the arab world   including egypt and jordan, its only two countries to recognize israel   and across the bitter divide between allies of regional rivals saudi arabia and iran, people denounced the move.   neither i nor my children nor my children s children will give up our right to palestine and jerusalem,  said hilmi aqel, a palestinian refugee born in jordan s al baqaa camp after his family fled the fighting that accompanied israel s creation.    america does what it wants because it s powerful and thinks it won t feel the consequences ... jerusalem is the capital of palestine, not of israel. it never can be,  said nada saeed, 24, a property broker in cairo.   this is a provocation for the arabs,  said mahdi msheikh, 43, a taxi driver in beirut s hamra district.  however, few people reuters interviewed on wednesday expected their governments to take any real action.   what saddens me most about this is that palestine in the past was an ultimate rights cause for us as syrians and arabs ... palestine has retreated from our priorities,  said a lecturer at damascus university, who asked not to be named.       saudi arabia, home to islam s holiest sites, pushed a plan in 2002 offering israel peace with all arab countries in return for a palestinian state including east jerusalem.  but a recent newspaper report suggested it was willing to compromise on several areas that are regarded by palestinians and some other arab countries as red lines. riyadh has denied that and called on trump not to move the embassy.   the current events on the world stage and especially in the gulf help trump take this step because the most important thing is that saudi arabia is not against it,  said adnan, a 52 year old trader in beirut.  the kingdom s top clergy issued a mild statement saying saudi arabia supported jerusalem, but did not explicitly denounce trump s move.  many saudi twitter users posting under the hashtag  jerusalem is the eternal capital of palestine , shared a film clip of the late king faisal, who launched the 1973 arab oil embargo against the west, pledging never to accept israel.  but one twitter user posting with a common saudi family name said that while muslims and arabs would be provoked by the move, its top royals would not be. instead, they would  suppress any move or call to jihad against the zionist enemy , he wrote. in cairo, khaled abdelkhalik, a lawyer, said:  we paraded trump as an ally of the arabs, but he turned out dirtier than his predecessors.   jordan, which agreed peace with israel in 1994 while the peace process with the palestinians still seemed on track, held a special session of parliament.   i call on my colleagues to tear up the treaty of humiliation and shame,  said mp yahya saoud, referring to the peace deal. jordan, like lebanon, is home to hundreds of thousands of palestinian refugees.   this is a conspiracy that is denying us our rights, the first of which is to return. they think we are a branch of thorns that they can step on and break,  said fadia, a social worker with two daughters in lebanon s burj al barajneh palestinian refugee camp.   but we are a bomb. if they step on it, it explodes,  she said.  in israel, analysts said that despite such warnings, they expected little violence or opposition.   the moderate camp in the arab world needs the united states as well as israel in order to face their main threat, which is iran,  said efraim inbar, president of the jerusalem institute for strategic studies.   we may see some public announcements maybe denouncing the american decision, but in substantive terms i don t think much will change.

" new york city mayor bill de blasio warned republican presidential candidate donald trump on thursday against embracing the “stop and frisk” police tactic that he said would worsen relations between police and community in the country. trump has praised the anti crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband and said on fox news on thursday it “massively changed” the crime statistics in new york city. “stop and frisk worked,” trump said on fox & friends on thursday. he said the crime ridden city of chicago needed to adopt the tactic.  de blasio rejected that claim and attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by bill bratton, the city’s longtime police commissioner who retired less than a week ago. bratton championed the “broken windows” policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor. in his resignation letter he attributed the decline in crime in new york city, the nation’s largest with 8.5 million people, to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods.  “donald trump talks about stop and frisk like he knows the facts,” de blasio said in an interview with cnn. “he has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety.  “he should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop and frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.” police tactics and deadly encounters with african americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country. a state of emergency was declared in charlotte, north carolina, after a second night of unrest sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man. there have also been protests in tulsa, oklahoma, in recent days demanding the arrest of a police officer seen in a video last week fatally shooting an unarmed black man who had his hands in clear view at the time.  the stop and frisk policy gained traction in new york city under mayor rudy giuliani, now a top trump supporter. de blasio promised to end the practice during his 2013 mayoral campaign. de blasio also credited the continued drop in crime in new york city in recent decades to a crime reduction strategy adopted by bratton called compstat, which adopts statistical strategies to achieve more effective policing. “that’s what changed things in new york city,” de blasio said, adding crime has gone down in the three years since his administration curtailed the use of stop and frisk. (fixes ninth paragraph to say protesters demanding arrest, officer not arrested.) ",0
" two prominent u.s. democratic senators are raising questions about president donald trump’s special adviser, carl icahn, asking in a letter on thursday if the activist investor is attempting to persuade the government to lift its “too big to fail” tag from insurer american international group. on friday, the financial stability oversight council, comprising the chiefs of u.s. financial regulatory agencies, will discuss aig’s designation as a “systemically important financial institution,” commonly known as one that is “too big to fail.” in an agenda for the meeting, the council did not say which institution it will discuss.  however, there are only two non banks designated as so large and interconnected that they would ruin the financial system if they failed   aig and prudential insurance (pru.n). the labels trigger stricter oversight and greater capital requirements. trump has ordered a review of the designation process, currently at the heart of a lawsuit involving metlife inc. (met.n), which many expect will lead his administration to rescind the current designations to try to lighten regulation it considers burdensome.  in a letter to u.s. treasury secretary steve mnuchin, senators elizabeth warren and sheldon whitehouse said icahn has retained “his massive business interests” while advising trump on regulation, including his sizable investment in aig (aig.n).  aig company received a $182 billion taxpayer bailout during the 2007 09 financial crisis, which prompted congress to call for the designations of non banks in the dodd frank wall street reform law as systemically important. icahn owned a 4.95 percent stake in aig as of march 31. concerned about compliance costs, icahn had publicly pressed aig to shrink, and tried to convince the fsoc that aig no longer qualified for the label. recently though, after aig sold some assets and appointed a new chief executive, icahn has not pushed the issue further.      senators warren and whitehouse also noted icahn met with one current fsoc member, securities and exchange commission (sec) chair jay clayton, after clayton was nominated for the position. “given mr. icahn’s recent modification of his position on the breakup of aig, and his past interactions with administration officials, we write to seek assurances that mr. icahn has not provided input on or received information on the pending fsoc decision on aig’s sifi status,” they said. the two senators asked about any fsoc measures to ensure  individuals with an interest in its decisions do not inappropriately influence its members. they also asked if any members are subject to recusal on aig because of interactions with icahn, and about any staff level conversations regarding icahn’s investments. aig declined to comment, and the white house and treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

" after the crushing electoral losses that swept donald trump into the white house and sealed republican control of the u.s. congress, the democrats’ road to recovery winds through the leafy, well heeled suburbs of north atlanta.  here, democrats are threatening a stunning special election upset that could signal how well the party can turn trump’s low approval ratings into political gains. and they appear to have an ally in the april 18 vote: trump himself.  in the most watched congressional race so far in the trump era, a wave of grassroots anti trump fervor has positioned democrat jon ossoff, a 30 year old political newcomer, to possibly capture a house of representatives seat held by republicans for decades, one of 24 seats democrats need nationwide to reclaim the house.  more from reuters: russian naval activity in europe exceeds cold war levels: u.s. admiraliran chides gulf arabsrussian computer programmer arrested in spain: embassy “the grassroots intensity here is electric, and it’s because folks are concerned that what is happening in washington doesn’t represent our values,” ossoff said in an interview. “this is a chance for this community to stand up and make a statement about what we believe.”  with democrats desperate for signs of hope after hillary clinton’s loss to trump, ossoff’s underdog “make trump furious” campaign has endeared him to national anti trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls. the documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide raised a jaw dropping $8.3 million in the first quarter, his campaign said.  “i’ve never seen the democrats around here so engaged, and it’s donald trump who got us so engaged,” said carolyn hadaway, 77, a veteran party activist and retired software engineer from marietta, a city of about 60,000 people in georgia’s central cobb county.  georgia would seem an unlikely venue for a democratic revival. trump won it by about 5 percentage points in november. and its voters backed republican nominees in eight of the last nine presidential contests, including the last six in a row.  but demographic changes are brewing. growing minority communities and transplants from other regions have made atlanta’s suburbs increasingly competitive for democrats. georgia’s sixth congressional district, the location for april’s special election, exemplifies changes common in booming southern cities like atlanta, charlotte and nashville.  the district is white collar, educated and doing well economically, with median household incomes of $80,000 versus $50,000 statewide, and nearly 60 percent of adults holding a college or professional degree, more than twice the statewide average. it is also increasingly diverse, and in recent years became a magnet for well educated immigrants from india and other parts of asia.  the district was about 80 percent white at the turn of the century. but since then, the black share of the population has grown from 10 percent to 13 percent, the hispanic share has doubled to 12.5 percent and asian representation doubled to more than 10 percent.  about a fifth of the district is now foreign born – twice the statewide average, according to census data.  though newer immigrants may not be eligible to vote, census data indicate more than 40 percent are naturalized citizens, potentially bringing a different set of views on issues like immigration to the table than the voters in this district who sent trump adviser and former speaker of the house newt gingrich to congress for 10 straight terms.  april’s special election fills the seat vacated by tom price, the new secretary of health and human services. it gives both parties a chance to test their messages for election battles next year in suburban districts where democrats need to make inroads and where trump’s populist economic message did not sell well in november.  while price sailed to re election with 62 percent of the vote, trump barely beat clinton in georgia’s sixth district by one percentage point. in 2012, republican mitt romney beat democratic president barack obama in the district by 23 points.  republican candidates nationwide will closely watch the result as they calculate whether to embrace the president.  the 11 republicans in the race have split between those who portray themselves as trump supporters and establishment candidates who keep a respectful and sometimes wary distance.  “i’m ready to support him,” former state senator dan moody, who was endorsed by u.s. senator david perdue, said of trump in an interview. but “i’m not going to jump over a cliff with him.”  grassroots democratic groups flood the district’s tidy suburban neighborhoods on the weekends, busing in volunteers from as far away as maryland to go door to door on ossoff’s behalf.  the ossoff momentum worries republicans, say party officials, and outside help has arrived. a super pac aligned with house republican leaders put more than $2 million into ads painting ossoff as too young and inexperienced.  ossoff played down the strategic value of a possible upset.  “the national implications here will be about how this affects the political calculus for folks in the republican conference in the house, not about how democrats are supposed to run in the midterms,” he said.  in a low turnout special election, getting supporters to the polls is vital, and democrats have voted early in greater numbers than republicans so far.  “we aren’t panicking, but there is concern,” said maggie holliman, a member of the republican state executive committee.  ossoff’s best chance is to win the april 18 vote, a “jungle primary” that features all 18 candidates from both parties on the same ballot. if no one reaches 50 percent, the top two vote getters square off on june 20.  republicans are confident they can win a one on one race with ossoff, as the party unites with organizational and financial help pouring into the republican majority district.  “there is a chance ossoff can win without a runoff, but that’s his only chance. he’s benefiting from unified democratic support and republicans being highly divided,” said georgia based republican strategist joel mcelhannon.  polls show ossoff hovering in the low 40s, not enough to avoid a runoff. the leading republican, former secretary of state karen handel, is well behind.  handel has been cautious in talking about trump. she said in an interview she expected to work with him on issues such as tax reform and border security, but “first and foremost” she would be a conservative advocate for her district.  by contrast republicans bob gray, a local business executive, and bruce levell, head of trump’s national diversity coalition, pledge undivided loyalty to the white house. gray said he was the republican in the race who performed the behind the scenes political groundwork for trump in the district.  levell pulled out his cellphone and showed a reporter text messages from trump aides kellyanne conway, sarah huckabee sanders and even trump son in law jared kushner to prove his insider status with the white house.  “if people are looking for someone to help trump,

" zimbabwe s first lady, grace mugabe, has denied assaulting south african model gabriella engels with an electric cable in a johannesburg hotel suite last month, saying an  intoxicated and unhinged  engels attacked her with a knife. in a previously unreported aug. 17 deposition seen exclusively by reuters, mugabe countered 20 year old engels  version, portraying herself as the victim after intervening on behalf of her adult sons chatunga and robert junior who were  in trouble with a drunken young woman . the statement said grace mugabe, 52 and a contender to replace her 93 year old husband as zimbabwe s president, was thinking about filing attempted murder charges. a group representing engels dismissed the allegations as lies. according to the model, an irate mugabe burst into the room where she was waiting with two friends to meet chatunga on aug. 13 and started laying into her with an electric cable. photographs taken by engels  mother soon after the incident showed gashes to the model s head. she also had bruising on her thighs. in her deposition, mugabe dismissed engels  version as  malicious allegations  and said she had been attacked after going to help her sons.  she was worried about them and went to see them at their hotel suite,  the statement said.  upon her arrival, ms engels, who was intoxicated and unhinged, attacked dr. grace mugabe with a knife after she was asked to leave the hotel.   security was left with no other option but to remove ms engels from the hotel suite,  it continued. the statement also alleged that engels had been in a fight with other women at johannesburg s taboo nightclub the previous evening and suggested that may have been the cause of her injuries. afriforum, an afrikaans civil society group acting on behalf of engels, denied both accusations.  gabriella never attacked grace mugabe in any way and she did not participate in the fight at taboo,  afriforum said.  it is clear that grace mugabe is desperately trying to escape responsibility for her own violent behavior by using lies to falsely portray the victim in this case as the perpetrator.  south africa granted grace mugabe diplomatic immunity, allowing her to evade immediate prosecution for assault, although engels and afriforum have challenged that decision, saying mugabe was not in south africa on official business. they also argued that assault was a  grave crime  that was not covered by diplomatic immunity laws. the decision to let grace mugabe return home caused a row in south africa, with the opposition democratic alliance also going to court to overturn the immunity.  according to zimbabwean intelligence files seen by reuters, robert mugabe lobbied his south african counterpart, jacob zuma, to have the issue  solved amicably  and out of court but was stymied by engels  refusal to accept a settlement.  he is trying to avoid the embarrassment of his wife appearing before the court,  one file, dated aug. 30, reads.  the problem he is facing is that the woman who was assaulted is refusing to accept any money and she just wants justice to be delivered upon grace.  afriforum lawyer gerrie nel   best known for prosecuting  south african track star oscar pistorius over the shooting of his girlfriend   said last month engels had been approached with a cash offer but had turned it down. the intelligence report is a part of a series of hundreds of files dating back to 2009 that have come from within zimbabwe s central intelligence organisation (cio). reuters has not been able to establish their original author or final audience. the aug. 30 report said mugabe was  changing his attitude  to the case and was now backing grace while accusing engels of impropriety.  mugabe wants people to stop castigating his wife and calling her all sorts of names,  it said.  mugabe is saying that his wife acted in an angry mood like all other women who find their children being involved with sleeping with whores.  afriforum chief executive kallie kriel said this allegation was an  absolute lie  and part of a deliberate attempt by harare to undermine engels  credibility as a witness. a spokesman for zimbabwe s presidency, which has direct oversight of the cio, was not immediately available for comment. zimbabwe s ambassador to south africa did not respond to a request for comment. zuma has denied any hand in the affair, telling parliament on aug. 31:  i am not a lawyer. i don t know the point of law and i was not involved in this process. how it was done, i would be lying if i speculate.  his spokesman declined to elaborate.

" the kremlin said on monday that talks with saudi arabia over moscow supplying riyadh with advanced s 400 air defense missile systems had gone well so far despite talk of a possible u.s. saudi arms deal. russian president vladimir putin hosted saudi arabia s king salman for talks at the kremlin last week during which saudi arabia said it had signed a memorandum of understanding on the purchase of the s 400s. a day later, the pentagon said the u.s. state department had approved the possible sale of a thaad anti missile defense system to saudi arabia at an estimated cost of $15 billion. when asked whether a possible u.s. deal with riyadh might affect the russian arrangement, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov, on a conference call with reporters, said talks had been progressing well.  we can speak only for ourselves,  said peskov.  (but)contacts to implement this contract have been very positive and have had very good preliminary results.  maria vorobyova, an official at a russian government agency dealing with military and technical cooperation, was cited earlier on monday as saying that a firm agreement had been reached with saudi arabia on the s 400s.  an agreement has been reached with the kingdom of saudi arabia to deliver the s 400 air defense system, anti tank kornet em rocket systems, tos 1a (multiple rocket launcher) systems, ags 30 automated grenade launchers, and kalashnikov ak 103 assault rifles,  the ria news agency cited her as saying.  russia also signed a contract last week for saudi to produce the ak 103 rifles under license along with ammunition. saudi arabia is a longstanding u.s. ally in the middle east and its arms deals with moscow have caused disquiet in washington.  when asked about fears that saudi arabia could use the  s 400 system against iran, a russian ally, peskov said moscow s decision to offer the missiles to riyadh was not aimed at any third party.  military technical cooperation between moscow and riyadh is absolutely self contained and does not target third countries in this region or other regions of the world,  said peskov.  therefore we are confident that this cooperation should not be a worry for anyone.

" springer nature, which publishes science magazines nature and scientific american, said on wednesday it had pulled access to a small number of articles in china to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. the decision comes after britain s cambridge university press (cup) said in august it had removed from its website in china about 300 papers and book reviews published in the china quarterly journal, after a request from the chinese government. cup, the publishing arm of elite cambridge university, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles, following an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. in a statement, germany based springer nature said that less than one percent of its content had been  limited  in mainland china.  this action is deeply regrettable, but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors,  it said.   this is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world. it is a local content access decision in china done to comply with specific local regulations,  it added. the financial times said at least 1,000 springer nature articles had been blocked in china, containing sensitive key words like taiwan, tibet and cultural revolution. under president xi jinping, beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and strengthened communist party authority over academia and other institutions. beijing said in september that chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products were legal. china s state council information office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours.  in not taking action we ran the very real risk of all of our content being blocked,  springer nature said.  we do not believe that it is in the interests of our authors, customers, or the wider scientific and academic community, or to the advancement of research, for us to be banned from distributing our content in china.  cambridge university press had said it had blocked articles on topics including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests, the 1960s cultural revolution and tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on sunday: aides to trump attack the credibility of the nonpartisan agency that will analyze the costs of a replacement for obamacare, as the white house seeks to quell opposition from many conservative republicans. two days before u.s. attorney preet bharara was fired, trump tried to call the high profile new york prosecutor in what a white house official says was an effort to “thank him for his service and to wish him good luck.” german chancellor angela merkel is controlled and cautious, a physicist from east germany who takes her time making decisions and has never relished the attention that comes from being europe’s most powerful leader. trump is a wealthy real estate magnate from new york who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight. on tuesday, they meet for the first time. when trump unveils his budget for the 2018 fiscal year on thursday, conservative republicans will be cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup. but more moderate republicans are less enthusiastic and worry they could be forced to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly. white house economic adviser gary cohn says the federal reserve “has been doing a good job” and the trump administration respects its independence, even if the u.s. central bank raises interest rates this week.

" a battle over who should run the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) in the coming months was set for court as obama era holdovers sought to maintain their control over a powerful watchdog which president donald trump is seeking to curb. cfpb staff returning to work on monday after the u.s. thanksgiving holiday break were left scratching their heads over who was in charge after outgoing director richard cordray formally resigned on friday and elevated his former chief of staff, leandra english, to replace him temporarily. hours later, president donald trump sought to over rule that move by naming his budget chief mick mulvaney — a harsh critic of the agency — as acting director. trump wants mulvaney to run the cfpb until he can get a permanent successor confirmed by the senate, a process which could take months. in yet another twist late on sunday, english sued the trump administration seeking to block mulvaney’s appointment. the move means a federal court will now decide which law applies when filling a temporary leadership vacancy at the relatively new agency. the unprecedented battle reflects competing visions of how to regulate the u.s. financial system. created in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory lending, the cfpb is hated by republicans who think it wields too much power and burdens banks and other lenders with unnecessary red tape. president barack obama appointed cordray, a democrat, as the cfpb’s first director and he developed a reputation for drafting aggressive rules curbing products such as payday loans while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like wells fargo (wfc.n).  in a tweet over the weekend, trump called the agency a “total disaster” that had “devastated” financial institutions. he has pledged to roll back many of the obama era financial regulations. liberal groups and consumer advocates planned a rally in front of the cfpb headquarters on monday morning to demonstrate support for the agency. as acting director, mulvaney would have the power to make far reaching decisions on enforcement and supervision of financial firms. trump administration officials say the president has the power to appoint an acting director under the 1998 federal vacancies reform act and, in an powerful boost for them, the cfpb’s own general counsel, mary mcleod, issued a three page memo agreeing.  “i advise all bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that director mulvaney is the acting director of the cfpb,” mcleod’s memo, dated november 25, stated. such advice will stick in the throats of many cfpb staffers. mulvaney once described the agency as a “sad, sick joke” and tried to get rid of it when he was a lawmaker in the house of representatives. english alluded to mulvaney’s views on the cfpb in her lawsuit. she has argued that the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that created the cfpb  stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs. cordray named english as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. the cfpb was the brainchild of elizabeth warren, a democratic senator and liberal firebrand. over the weekend, lawmakers from both parties lined up to give opposing views of its role. dick durbin, the u.s. senate’s no. 2 democrat, told cnn on sunday that “wall street hates it like the devil hates holy water.” while the legal battle rages, the cfpb’s enforcement work will be put in limbo. “anything that the agency does or fails to do could be subject to challenge until this cloud is removed,” said harvard law school professor laurence tribe. the cfpb was preparing to sue santander (san.mc) as early as this week alleging that the spanish bank overcharged borrowers on auto loans, two sources familiar with the plans told reuters last week. it was not clear if that lawsuit will now go ahead. the agency’s rule making ability has already been halted by the republican controlled congress, which last month killed a cfpb rule that had allowed borrowers to join together to sue lenders. even if english prevails, trump’s permanent nominee is expected to neutralize much of the cfpb’s work. some of the names mentioned by lobbyists as potential permanent successors to cordray include republican representatives jeb hensarling and french hill, both cfpb critics.

" traces of a deadly nerve agent that killed the estranged half brother of north korean leader kim jong un were found on the clothes worn by the two women accused of the sensational murder, a malaysian court was told on thursday. indonesian siti aisyah, 25, and doan thi huong, 28, a vietnamese, are charged with murdering kim jong nam by smearing his face with vx, a chemical poison banned by the united nations, at kuala lumpur airport on feb. 13. a chemical weapons expert with the malaysian government said his analysis showed traces of vx, its precursors and degradation products on the sleeves of a t shirt worn by huong, as well as vx degradation products on siti aisyah s sleeveless shirt.      the presence of precursors and vx confirms the presence of vx itself,  the expert, raja subramaniam, told the court outside the malaysian capital.  i also found degradation products of vx, which confirms the presence of vx.  the testimony was used to back the prosecution s position that vx was used in the murder and was the sole cause of death, a scenario defense lawyers disputed this week. [nl4n1me159] in response to a prosecution question, raja agreed that vx could be applied on a bare palm and potentially have no effect on a person if washed off quickly enough. the lethality of vx depended on the dosage and where on the body it was applied, he added.  the concentration required varies by a factor of 26, from the cheek, which is sensitive, to the palm, which is least sensitive, to have the same effect,  raja said. raja said penetration of vx into the body is highest in areas with higher concentrations of blood, such as the head, neck, eyes and ears. on the least sensitive areas, such as the palm, where larger amounts of tissue and fat deposits block absorption, raja said an individual would have up to 15 minutes to wash off the nerve poison with running water.  if you decontaminate within 15 minutes, most likely no effect or delayed effect (from vx),  raja said, citing studies on human test subjects. the women have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in some sort of prank for a reality tv show. they face the death penalty if convicted. [nl4n1md1mk] the trial will resume on monday. ",0

" suspected boko haram militants killed 18 people in northeast nigeria on friday, according to local witnesses and officials, the latest in an escalating number of lethal attacks in the region. the knife wielding attackers, moving under cover of night,  targeted people in the town of banki, 80 miles (130 km) southeast of the city of maiduguri in borno state, the epicenter of the eight year conflict with boko haram, said a community leader and a local member of a vigilante group. the attack on the town, which sits on the border with cameroon, is the latest in a string of deadly boko haram raids and bombings that have undermined the nigerian military s statements that the insurgency is all but defeated. the frequency of attacks in northeastern nigeria has increased in the last few months, killing at least 172 people since june 1 before friday s attack, according to a reuters tally. the attack on banki left 18 dead, according to modu perobe, a member of the civilian joint task force, a regional vigilante group. abor ali, a local ruler, confirmed the death toll. boko haram s eight year insurgency has left at least 20,000 dead and sparked one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world, with tens of thousands already in famine like conditions, according to the united nations. some 8.5 million people in the worst affected parts of northeast nigeria are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, with 5.2 million people lacking secure access to food, the u.n. has said.

" the u.s. supreme court may weigh in this week on gun control, an issue smoldering again following the june 12 orlando massacre, with the justices due to decide whether to hear a challenge by gun rights advocates to assault weapon bans in two states. the connecticut and new york laws prohibit semiautomatic weapons like the one used by the gunman who fatally shot 49 people at a gay night club in orlando in the deadliest mass shooting in modern u.s. history. the supreme court will announce as soon as monday whether it will hear the challenge brought by gun rights groups and individual firearms owners asserting that the laws violate the u.s. constitution’s second amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms. the court has not decided a major gun case since 2010.  if they take up the matter, the justices would hear arguments in their next term, which begins in october. a decision not to hear the challenge would leave in place lower court rulings upholding the laws. the court’s action in another recent appeal indicated it may be disinclined to take up the matter. the justices in december opted not to hear a challenge to a highland park, illinois ordinance banning assault weapons and large capacity magazines. a national assault weapons ban expired in 2004. congressional republicans, backed by the influential national rifle association gun rights lobby, beat back efforts to restore it. some states and municipalities have enacted their own bans. in their petition asking the supreme court to hear the case, those challenging the connecticut law said the type of weapons banned by the state are used in self defense, hunting and recreational shooting. connecticut said its law targets firearms disproportionately used in gun crime, “particularly the most heinous forms of gun violence.” it said people in connecticut still can legally own more than 1,000 types of handguns, rifles and shotguns. there is a longstanding legal debate over the scope of second amendment rights. in the 2008 district of columbia v. heller case, the supreme court held for the first time that the second amendment guaranteed an individual’s right to bear arms, but the ruling applied only to firearms kept in the home for self defense. that ruling did not involve a state law, applying only to federal regulations. two years later, in the case mcdonald v. city of chicago, the court held that the heller ruling covered individual gun rights in states.

" u.s. senator bob menendez abused his power to help a wealthy benefactor in a years long bribery scheme that netted the new jersey democrat lavish gifts and major campaign donations, federal prosecutors told a jury on wednesday. “this case is about a corrupt politician who sold his senate office for a life of luxury he couldn’t afford,” the lead prosecutor, peter koski, said at the start of menendez’s corruption trial in newark. menendez’s lawyer, abbe lowell, said prosecutors had twisted a close, brother like relationship into something illicit. “acting out of friendship is not improper, it is not corrupt, and it is certainly not a crime,” he said. menendez is accused of intervening with federal officials to help his co defendant salomon melgen, a florida ophthalmologist who gave the senator private flights, stays at a caribbean villa and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money. the case comes at a crucial time in washington, d.c., where republicans hold a razor thin 52 48 edge in the senate. if menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled by his colleagues before january, his replacement would be named by new jersey governor chris christie, a republican. a group of supporters cheered menendez, 63, as he entered court on wednesday morning. the senator told reporters he had “never backed away from a fight.” he is running for a third six year term in 2018 despite the charges. koski told jurors menendez used his influence to help melgen, securing visas for melgen’s foreign girlfriends and pressuring the u.s. state department to resolve a contract dispute between a company melgen owned and the dominican republic. after medicare, the federal insurance plan for the elderly and disabled, concluded melgen had overbilled it by $8.9 million, menendez asked officials to change the reimbursement policy, koski said. melgen was convicted earlier this year of perpetrating a massive medicare fraud. he has yet to be sentenced. koski also urged jurors to pay attention to the timing of melgen’s gifts. in april 2012, for instance, menendez met with an assistant secretary of state regarding the dominican republic dispute; melgen gave menendez $80,000 on the same day. “robert menendez was salomon melgen’s personal united states senator,” koski said. lowell said menendez only acted at melgen’s suggestion after researching the issue with his staff and concluding it was sound policy. he also accused prosecutors of cherry picking a handful of examples amidst countless similar interventions that menendez has made over the years when matters were brought to his attention. the trial is expected to last up to eight weeks.

" french finance minister bruno le maire will meet german officials in berlin this week to discuss the future of the euro zone and assess his own prospects of becoming the next chairman of the eurogroup forum of finance ministers. french and german officials confirmed le maire would be in berlin on wednesday, when he will meet acting finance minister peter altmaier, a close ally of german chancellor angela merkel. le maire is also due to see christian lindner, leader of the liberal free democrats (fdp), and cem oezdemir, co leader of the greens party. both are in discussions with merkel s conservatives on forming a coalition government. france s emmanuel macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five year presidency. but any changes will require the support of merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before christmas. lindner has been critical of macron s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.   we want to follow up on the president s sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,  a french finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by macron in september when he laid out his vision for eu reform. while le maire s visit   his first to berlin since the german election   is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out berlin on the eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month. since it was created in 2005, the eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: luxembourg s jean claude juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former dutch finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in january. the position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. the post has been dubbed  mr euro . le maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. but some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either germany or france, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking. a further complication for le maire is france s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. german officials are not ruling out le maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country. last week, one official in berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: pierre gramegna of luxembourg and peter kazimir of slovakia. the official also floated the idea of extending dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of berlin, even though he is not part of the new dutch government.  it is still quite unclear who will come forward,  the german official said when asked about the presidency.  at this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. there is no natural candidate.  the eurogroup president will be chosen on dec. 4, an eu official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid november.  it is not a done thing,  the german official said of le maire s candidacy.  he will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.     the talks in berlin on wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring. if le maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. mario draghi will end his term as president of the european central bank on oct. 31, 2019, and germany s jens weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor. euro zone watchers say that if the french secure the presidency of the eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a german candidate taking over the ecb. still, as one senior french official told reuters on condition of anonymity last month, weidmann at the helm of the ecb  would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for france .

" panama s decision to ditch long standing ties with self ruled taiwan and switch recognition to china had nothing to do with  checkbook diplomacy , its president has told chinese state television. panama established diplomatic relations with china in june in a major victory for beijing, as it lures away the dwindling number of countries that have formal relations with the island china claims as its own. taiwan s government said at the time it was sorry and angry over panama s decision, and that it would not compete with china in what it described as a  diplomatic money game . china and taiwan have tried to poach each other s allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, although taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful china. panamanian president juan carlos varela said the decision was correct and was panama s alone.  i didn t ask anything from china,  varela told chinese state television s english language channel in an interview shown late monday.  i just think it was the right thing to do for my country, for the people of panama and for the future of a strong relationship between china and panama,  he said in response to a question about whether it was  checkbook diplomacy . varela said he told u.s. president donald trump about the decision a few hours before the official announcement and trump supported it, the report said. varela also said that visits to shanghai and beijing when he was vice president in 2010 inspired his decision.  in 2010, i went to shanghai for the world special olympic games and i was very impressed with the city and then i went to beijing and saw how china was opening its economy, i saw all these developments,  he said. china is deeply suspicious of taiwan president tsai ing wen, who it thinks wants to push for the island s formal independence, although she says she wants to maintain peace with beijing. china and taiwan had engaged in a diplomatic truce between 2008 and early 2016 under the leadership of taiwan s then president ma ying jeou from the china friendly nationalist party. since tsai assumed office last year, china has poached one other former taiwan ally, the tiny west african state of sao tome and principe. gambia also established ties with china last year, although it ditched taiwan before tsai came to office. beijing says taiwan has no right to diplomatic recognition because it is part of china. defeated nationalist forces fled to taiwan at the end of china s civil war in 1949.

" a senior texas health official who co authored a report that criticized the state’s funding cuts to planned parenthood for reducing access to reproductive healthcare will retire from his post next month, a texas commission said on friday. rick allgeyer, the texas health and human services commission’s director of research, faced criticism from the state’s republican leaders over the report published in the prestigious new england journal of medicine this month. the report said state funding cuts to planned parenthood and its affiliates had an adverse effect on family planning for lower income people. allgeyer is eligible to retire and decided to do so effective on march 31, the commission said. allgeyer, who has been at the commission for 16 years and was one of the study’s five listed authors, declined to comment. in 2011, the texas state legislature cut planned parenthood out of one family planning program and revamped the way another program hands out funds, placing it and other private clinics at the bottom of the list. top texas political leaders have said after cutting off funding for planned parenthood that the state has been able to rebuild its safety net.  independent health experts dispute the claim, saying texas still has a long way to go before it can provide the level of service it did when planned parenthood was an integral part of its family planning efforts. the texas plan has garnered attention among republicans in the u.s. congress who are looking to defund the nation’s largest family planning provider at the national level.    the study said the cuts appeared to lead to an increase of unintended pregnancies among lower income residents and a decrease in access to long acting reversible contraception. it also said the cuts appeared to increase the rate of childbirths covered by medicaid. some texas republicans said it was inappropriate for a state employee to be involved in such a study and that its results were flawed, putting political pressure on allgeyer.

" president donald trump invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to visit washington in early february during a phone call in which they discussed the importance of strengthening the u.s. israeli relationship, the white house said on sunday. in his first call with netanyahu since taking office on friday, trump stressed his “unprecedented commitment to israel’s security.” “the president and the prime minister agreed to continue to closely consult on a range of regional issues, including addressing the threats posed by iran,” the white house said in a statement. trump also said peace between israel and the palestinians could only be negotiated between the two parties, but that the united states would work with israel to achieve that goal. relations between israel and the obama administration ended on a contentious note, when the united states declined to veto a u.n. security council resolution calling for a halt to israeli settlement building. the readout from the white house did not include any mention of moving the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv, an action that would likely spark anger in the arab world. earlier on sunday, the white house said it was only in the early stages of talks to fulfill trump’s campaign pledge to relocate the embassy. “we are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject,” white house spokesman sean spicer said in a statement. aides said no announcement of an embassy move was imminent. washington’s embassy is in tel aviv, as are most foreign diplomatic posts. israel calls jerusalem its eternal capital, but palestinians also lay claim to the city as part of an eventual palestinian state. both sides cite biblical, historical and political claims. any decision to break with the status quo is likely to prompt protests from u.s. allies in the middle east such as saudi arabia, jordan and egypt. washington relies on those countries for help in fighting the islamic state militant group, which the new u.s. president has said is a priority. the u.s. congress passed a law in 1995 describing jerusalem as the capital of israel and saying it should not be divided, but successive republican and democratic presidents have used their foreign policy powers to maintain the embassy in tel aviv and to back negotiations between israel and the palestinians on the status of jerusalem. in early december, then president barack obama renewed the presidential waiver on an embassy move until the beginning of june. it is unclear whether trump would be able to legally override it and go ahead with relocation of the embassy. u.s. diplomats say that, despite the u.s. legislation, washington’s foreign policy is in practice broadly aligned with that of the united nations and other major powers, which do not view jerusalem as israel’s capital and do not recognize israel’s annexation of arab east jerusalem after its capture in the 1967 middle east war.   israel approved building permits on sunday for hundreds of homes in three east jerusalem settlements in expectation that trump will row back on the previous administration’s criticism of such projects.

" when the u.s. congress returns from summer vacation on tuesday, for the first time in years gutting obamacare will not be the main order of business on the healthcare agenda.  but leftover hard feelings in the wake of the long, partisan obamacare wars could poison other issues. among them will be a measure to keep federal funding flowing to an insurance program that helps millions of children and pregnant women. the children’s health insurance program (chip) must be reauthorized by a vote of congress by sept. 30. if that does not happen, the program is expected to run out of money. another issue will be stabilizing the individual insurance market created under the 2010 affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. in recent months, the trump administration has worked to undermine it and insurers have raised premiums by double digits or exited the market. republicans in congress spent six months trying to make good on a seven year campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare, also a top campaign promise by president donald trump, while democrats remained unanimously opposed.  the effort, which inflamed partisanship and exposed deep divisions within the republican party, ended with a dramatic failed senate vote in july, leaving the law in place, but damaged.  reauthorization of chip is typically not contentious. the program has bipartisan support. but lobbyists and industry officials said that any healthcare effort in congress could become partisan in this political climate. “anything having to do with healthcare after the process we’ve gone through is subject to being controversial,” one health industry lobbyist said last week.  serving as a backdrop for congress’ deliberations, including hearings scheduled for wednesday and thursday, will be trump and his twitter account. in several tweets, trump has chastised lawmakers, sometimes by name, for failing to deliver on their promise to get rid of obamacare. if that continues, already rocky relations between trump and fellow republicans could worsen. several congressional aides, lobbyists and industry officials said they were skeptical that lawmakers would be able to move past the bitter months long republican push to gut obamacare and somehow achieve bipartisan cooperation on healthcare. the obamacare markets’ problems have worsened amid conflicting messages from trump and the republicans’ effort to dismantle the healthcare law. republican aides and lobbyists said there was little appetite to try once more to repeal and replace it. they said republicans, controlling the white house, house of representatives and senate, were unlikely to take up the repeal and replace effort for the remainder of 2017. trump’s administration has moved to undercut obamacare, slashing its advertising budget by 90 percent and backing off enforcement of the so called individual mandate, the requirement that everyone purchase insurance or pay a fine.

" france has stopped a large shipment of belarus mushrooms contaminated with low level radioactivity probably from chernobyl and not linked to a radioactive cloud that appeared in southern russia last month, officials said on thursday. earlier, the head of french nuclear regulator asn pierre franck chevet told the french senate that traces of cesium had been found on imported mushrooms from russia and did not mention belarus. a spokesman for french nuclear safety institute irsn said that a few days ago customs officials found that a 3.5 tonne shipment of belarus mushrooms coming through frankfurt, germany was contaminated with cesium 137, a radioactive nuclide that is a waste product of nuclear reactors.  while the contaminated mushrooms did not represent a health threat to consumers, the shipment will be destroyed in a specialized incinerator in coming days, the irsn said.   there is no link with the ruthenium 106 pollution,  the official said.  earlier this month the irsn said that a cloud containing radioactive ruthenium 106 originating from southern russia had blown over large parts of europe in october but added that there was no danger to people.  russia later confirmed it had measured ruthenium pollution at nearly 1,000 times normal levels in the ural mountains, but did not acknowledge any accident.  as the mushrooms came from belarus, it is very likely the contamination originated in chernobyl,  the official said. asn did not reply to a number of reuters calls later on thursday.  chernobyl, ukraine is just south of the belarus border and was the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. cesium 137, which has a 30 year half life, is still widely found in the areas around chernobyl. the official said it was highly unusual for such a large shipment of mushrooms to be stopped and that none of the produce had made it onto french retail markets. mushrooms, more than any other vegetable, concentrate radioactivity because their thread like root systems spread over a large area for several meters on the surface around the plant. the irsn said eating tens of kilos of the belarus mushrooms would expose a consumer to a radioactivity level similar to natural ambient radioactivity during a whole year.  he added there had been no risk for the customs officials, even if they had touched the mushrooms with their bare hands. earlier, the head of the french nuclear regulator asn told the french senate that traces of cesium had been found on imported mushrooms and said there was no connection with the ruthenium pollution. french consumer protection agency dgccrf said in a statement that the belarus mushrooms had cesium 137 levels above legal limits but contained no ruthenium 106.  the agency said that following the discovery of the ruthenium, it had started testing samples of food products imported from the regions affected by the radioactive cloud. so far, it has not found food items with ruthenium 106 levels above legal thresholds.

" the administration of u.s. president donald trump opposed opening the door to grandparents from six muslim majority countries on monday, arguing in a court filing that the government’s interpretation of how to implement its temporary travel ban is based on u.s. immigration law. the u.s. supreme court in a ruling last monday revived parts of trump’s march 6 executive order that banned people from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts. the highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible “bona fide relationship” with a u.s. person or entity. trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. but opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against muslims. after the supreme court ruling, the government said that a “bona fide relationship” means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned.  the government’s definition, “hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by congress in the immigration and nationality act,” department of justice lawyers argued in court papers on monday.   the government’s filing came after the state of hawaii last week went to u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the supreme court’s ruling, arguing the government’s definition of “bona fide relationship” was too narrow. the government said hawaii, and refugee organizations that filed a “friend of the court” brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply “broader, free hand rules.” the refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the u.s. government, qualifies as a “bona fide” relationship with a u.s. entity. any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the supreme court ruling.  but the government said workers with offers of employment with a u.s. company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from u.s. resettlement agencies. “a refugee’s relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency,” the government said in its brief. “indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the united states.”  using the organization’s interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order “largely meaningless,” the government said.  u.s. refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until july 6, the state department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by trump’s executive order is likely to be reached.  late on thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fiancés, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. the court filing described a 72 hour scramble to “coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance” on how to implement the supreme court’s ruling.  the roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on friday compared to in january when trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

" german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives hope to draw the social democrats (spd) into coalition with offers on healthcare and employment, one of her ministers said, but the two camps remain far apart on tax issues. merkel s cdu/csu alliance won a national election in september, but she has so far failed to agree terms with other parties on a coalition that would enable her to serve a fourth term. her best chance now appears to be a reboot of the  grand coalition  with the centre left spd that ran germany from 2013 to 2017 and continues to govern in a caretaker capacity. peter altmaier, acting finance minister and merkel s chancellery chief, told newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung he thought such an alliance was again possible. the spd had previously said it intended to go into opposition after suffering its worst election result in more than eight decades. but germany s two biggest political groups are now set to start exploratory coalition talks next month and hope to decide by jan. 12 whether to open full blown negotiations. asked what offers the conservatives would make, altmaier said:  we ll of course talk with the spd about problems in hospitals and nursing care, improvements for families and children, broadband expansion, qualification for new jobs and how we can reach full employment.  there is overlap with the spd on these areas, he said, adding that helping germany s 900,000 long term unemployed needed to be a key project   an idea likely to go down well with the spd. taxation could be a sticking point, however. senior spd member andrea nahles told german magazine der spiegel her party wanted to press for a higher top rate of tax for individuals and non listed companies and ensure the wealthy paid more.  the conservatives have rejected the idea of higher taxes for the rich. altmaier said that while the conservatives would not draw any red lines ahead of the talks, they wanted a coalition treaty to include a pledge not to raise taxes or increase debt. the spd also wants to scrap germany s dual healthcare system of premium private care and more widely accessible public care to replace it with a single  citizen s insurance . the conservatives fear that would harm competition. nahles said employers and employees needed to pay the same amount towards public healthcare and doctors  fees for public and private healthcare systems should be reviewed. while the conservatives have made clear they are keen on another  grand coalition , the spd has kept the option of tolerating a minority merkel led government on the table. the chancellor rejects that idea. senior spd member and foreign minister sigmar gabriel told the funke newspaper consortium that some of his party colleagues were ready to live with a minority government. but he said he worried about the implications for europe s stability.  i m rather skeptical,  he said in an interview published on friday as political crisis gripped spain, where separatists were set to regain power in catalonia following regional elections.  a shaky government in germany would probably lead to an earthquake in europe   but we need to talk about it.

" u.s. president donald trump is set to formally announce a review of vehicle fuel efficiency rules locked in at the end of the obama administration when he meets with automaker chiefs this week, according to two sources briefed on the matter. the move by trump would be a victory for automakers after months of pushing the new administration to reconsider the rules, which they say would be too expensive, could cost jobs and are out of step with vehicles consumers want to buy. trump will visit an autonomous vehicle testing facility in a detroit suburb on wednesday and meet there with chief executives of several u.s. automakers. his administration has decided to review the feasibility of the vehicle emissions rules, which apply to the years 2022 through 2025, sources told reuters last week. former president barack obama moved to keep them in the final days of his administration. reuters reported on the planned announcement on march 3. a formal notice by u.s. regulators to restart the review is expected to be made public on wednesday.  white house spokesman sean spicer said on monday the trip is focused on “job creation and automobile manufacturing... highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth.” the chief executives of general motors co (gm.n), ford motor co (f.n) and fiat chrysler automobiles nv (fcha.mi) (fcau.n) will meet with the president in ypsilanti township, michigan, along with senior officials from japanese and german automakers, including toyota motor corp (7203.t), nissan motor co (7201.t) and daimler ag (daign.de). trump will hold a roundtable with ceos and then make a speech to autoworkers and others. the u.s. environmental protection agency had until april 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a “midterm review,” but moved up its decision to a week before obama left office in january. automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. they argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices. environmentalists, who favor the standards, say the rules will reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the trump administration weakens them. trade groups representing automakers, including general motors, volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de) and toyota, have asked the epa to withdraw the determination finalizing the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the u.s. government. changing the 2022 2025 fuel rules will require a lengthy regulatory process and environmentalists and democratic state attorneys general are likely to sue if the trump administration significantly weakens the requirements. the obama administration said in 2011 the changes would boost fuel efficiency to a fleet wide average of 54.5 mpg, save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. the fuel standards were a central part of obama’s legacy on addressing climate change. in july, the epa estimated the fleet would average only 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025 under the rules because americans were buying more sport utility vehicles and trucks and fewer cars. automakers briefed on the meeting do not expect the epa to take action this week to attempt to prevent california from setting its own vehicle emissions rules. a trump administration official confirmed it does not intend to address california’s authority this week. reuters reported last week the epa is considering taking steps to reverse california’s waiver under the clean air act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. trump has repeatedly met with automaker ceos since taking office and made boosting employment, especially in the auto sector, a top priority.

" when johnathan smith resigned from the u.s. justice department on inauguration day, he looked forward to spending time with his infant son, but that plan unraveled a week later when president donald trump unveiled his explosive foreign travel ban. within two weeks, smith had a new job as legal director of civil rights group muslim advocates and was drafting briefs for a successful court challenge to the ban, joining other former top obama administration lawyers now fighting trump. it is not surprising that smith and some of his colleagues, political appointees of democratic president barack obama, would leave the justice department now led by republicans. what is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be trump adversaries. some republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post election. george terwilliger, a senior justice department official under president george h.w. bush, described the obama lawyers’ actions as “unprecedented to my memory – and really bad form.” one reason for the obama lawyers’ quick moves, some of them said, was trump’s aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges. obama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for president george w. bush, over issues such as immigration and obamacare. but those came later in obama’s presidency.  besides smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former attorney general eric holder, who is advising california’s legislature on challenging trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general neal katyal, who is helping hawaii contest trump’s revised travel ban. influential manhattan prosecutor preet bharara and another 45 obama era u.s. attorneys are out of jobs after the trump administration asked them to resign on friday. many of the obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some republicans, that obama is behind resistance efforts. some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to trump’s hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests. “there’s a unique threat to our democracy and constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the muslim community,” said smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the justice department. norman eisen, who was obama’s top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the czech republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after trump’s election. but instead, he said, “the ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial obama role.”  eisen is now also chairing citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a watchdog group he co founded. the group has already sued trump over alleged ethics violations. other obama appointees taking on trump include former white house lawyer ian bassin who has founded united to protect democracy, a new group probing trump over ethics; and james cadogan, who worked with smith at the justice department, and is now at the naacp legal defense and education fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration. some career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose trump. one is sharon mcgowan, who worked on lgbt issues at the justice department. on inauguration day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at lambda legal, an lgbt advocacy group. mcgowan said she decided to leave justice when trump named jeff sessions, a hardline conservative alabama senator, to be attorney general. that was a “game changer,” she said. “i knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what i’ve been working on so hard.” ",0
" at least five ugandan lawmakers received hospital treatment for injuries sustained while being dragged out of the parliament by plain clothes security guards that opposition mps said were really soldiers from president yoweri museveni s special forces. the clashes erupted in the chamber on tuesday and wednesday over a motion to end a constitutional limit on the president s age, effectively allowing 73 year old museveni, one of africa s most entrenched  big men , to extend his 31 years in power.    reinforcing lawmakers  suggestions that soldiers had been involved in the incidents, television footage showed uganda s special forces commander was in parliament just before dozens of mps were forcibly removed. ugandan authorities have not commented on the suggestions. rights groups denounced the incidents as a violation of the parliament s bar on police or soldiers entering the chamber.  in effect what happened was an overthrow of the constitutional order,  said nicholas opiyo, a kampala based human rights lawyer and political analyst. one of the ejected mps, gaffa mbwatekamwa, sported a cracked left arm in bandages and a sling as he described his ordeal.  these guys grabbed me from behind and one twisted my arm. i started screaming and another one squeezed my balls,  he told reuters at a kampala hospital where he was visiting a fellow injured legislator. he and other mps said they had also been punched and kicked by the security guards. mbwatekamwa added that some of the alleged guards were recognized as members of the armed forces. that claim was backed up by footage aired on thursday by the private ntv uganda channel of special forces command (sfc) colonel don nabasa pacing the corridors of parliament moments before the security guards burst into the chamber. police chief kale kayihura also told the nbs television channel police had enlisted the help of  sister  security agencies to clear parliament, a term frequently used by police to refer to the armed forces. police spokesman asan kasigye denied legislators had been beaten by security personnel. a spokesman for the special forces command said he could not comment beyond the statement from the police chief. u.s. ambassador deborah malac criticized the  rough treatment  of the lawmakers and said she expected them to be treated  humanely . despite the growing cries of autocracy against museveni, washington has backed him as a strongman who has turned uganda into a bulwark of stability in africa s troubled great lakes region. nabasa s predecessor as head of the special forces was museveni s son, muhoozi kainerugaba, who many ugandans believe is being groomed as a successor to his father. uganda s next election is in 2021. museveni s moves to extend his term mirror similar attempts in neighboring democratic republic of congo and burundi, where they have sparked serious political instability, including armed insurrection.

" a high profile conference on libya planned for mid february in washington has been postponed, the organizers said on friday, citing u.s. president donald trump’s temporary ban on nationals of seven muslim majority countries, including libya, from entering the united states. the feb. 16 conference titled “libya u.s. relations 2017: new vision, hope and opportunities,” and co hosted by the national council on u.s. libya relations, had listed libyan speakers, including two former prime ministers and the head of the national oil corporation (noc). as a result of the executive order, “banning libyan citizens from entrance to the usa, it will not be feasible for the full complement of speakers, sponsors and guests to be in washington, d.c., as originally planned,” a statement from the conference organizers said.  a new date for the conference would be announced soon. the executive order by trump comes at a time of uncertainty over u.s. policy in libya, which remains mired in the chaos that followed the nato backed 2011 uprising against long time leader muammar gaddafi. “this administration recognizes the role of the oil industry in economic stability and recognizes the importance of economic stability for political stability,” rihab el haj, a member of the national council on u.s. libya relations, told reuters. “we have been working for visa waivers for speakers and key sponsors and based on our conversations with the various institutions involved in making the decision, there was consensus this was an important event and there is political will to facilitate the conference but it’s just a question of timing and we understand that humanitarian exceptions are a priority,” she said. the united nations backed government of national accord (gna) was strongly supported by the administration of former president barack obama, but has struggled to assert its authority in tripoli and beyond. factions in eastern libya aligned with a rival government and khalifa haftar, an influential military commander, welcomed trump’s election, hoping for more support for their anti islamist stance. several speakers who had been slated to attend the conference are connected with or loyal to eastern based factions. “generally speaking, the department of homeland security and department of state may on a case by case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked under this executive order,” said william cocks, spokesman for the state department’s bureau of consular affairs. “as visa records are confidential under u.s. law, i’m unable to discuss any individual cases.” ",0
" florida governor rick scott vowed on wednesday that the state would aggressively investigate how six people died at a nursing home that lost power when hurricane irma rampaged through the region, as millions coped with another day without electricity. the death toll from the storm approached 80 as officials continued to assess the damage after irma powered through the caribbean as one of the most powerful atlantic hurricanes on record and slammed into the florida keys archipelago with sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour). irma killed at least 36 people in florida, georgia and south carolina, according to officials. some 4.2 million homes and businesses, or about 9 million people, were without power on wednesday in florida and nearby states. police opened a criminal investigation at the rehabilitation center at hollywood hills in hollywood, north of miami, where three elderly residents were found dead at the facility and three later died at a nearby hospital, officials said.  i am going to work to aggressively demand answers on how this tragic event took place,  scott said in a statement.  this situation is unfathomable. every facility that is charged with caring for patients must take every action and precaution to keep their patients safe.  more than 100 patients at the nursing home were evacuated on wednesday along with 18 patients from a nearby facility that was cleared due to the criminal investigation, hollywood officials said.  most of the patients have been treated for respiratory distress, dehydration and heat related issues,  randy katz, a spokesman for memorial regional hospital, told reporters. memorial regional is located across the street from the nursing home.  police were first called to the facility at about 4:30 a.m. but did not arrive until after 6 a.m., officials said. the center had been without air conditioning, broward county mayor barbara sharief told reporters on wednesday.  the building has been sealed off and we are conducting a criminal investigation inside,  hollywood police chief tomas sanchez told reporters on wednesday.  it was very hot on the second floor.  florida power & light said it had provided power to some parts of the hollywood nursing home but that the facility was not on a county top tier list for emergency power restoration. irma caused about $25 billion in insured losses, including $18 billion in the united states and $7 billion in the caribbean, catastrophe modeler karen clark & co estimated on wednesday. the florida keys were particularly hard hit, with federal officials saying that 25 percent of homes were destroyed and 65 percent suffered major damage when irma barreled ashore on sunday as a category 4 hurricane. most residents had left by then and police have barred re entry to most of the keys to allow more time to restore electricity and medical service and bring water, food and fuel.  i don t have a house. i don t have a job. i have nothing,  said mercedes lopez, 50, whose family fled north from the keys town of marathon on friday and rode out the storm at an orlando hotel, only to learn their home was destroyed, along with the gasoline station where lopez worked. president donald trump is due to visit the region on thursday. irma wreaked total devastation in parts of the caribbean, where at least 43 people have died. people who fled their homes in hard hit islands including st. martin and the u.s. virgin islands that were all but cut off from the world for days arrived in san juan late tuesday.  michael beason, 65, of st. john in the u.s. virgin islands, said he lost everything.   my house, my business, both my vehicles, everything is gone,  said beason, who was stopping in san juan before continuing to boston to seek refuge with his wife s brother.   but we have life. we rode out that horrible storm in a shower that i had reinforced after hurricane marilyn,  beason added.  i told the man (who installed the shower), i told him,  if the hurricane takes the rest of my house, i want this shower sticking up out of that slab like the last tooth in the mouth of a bum. and sure enough that s what s left.  irma hit the united states about two weeks after hurricane harvey plowed into houston, killing about 60 and causing some $180 billion in damage, mostly from flooding.

" the u.s. interior department finalized rules on tuesday aimed at preventing methane leaks from oil and gas production on federal and tribal lands, one of the last major obama administration rules aimed at fighting climate change. interior’s bureau of land management (blm) said on tuesday the rule, updating 30 year old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production, could avoid wasting up to 41 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per year.  “this rule to prevent waste of our nation’s natural gas supplies is good government, plain and simple,” said interior secretary sally jewell.  “we are proving that we can cut harmful methane emissions that contribute to climate change, while putting in place standards that make good economic sense for the nation.” environmental groups praised the rule, but industry and some western states called it unnecessary. one industry group sued blm. the incoming trump administration has promised to cut what it calls superfluous restrictions on energy production. an interior department fact sheet said that between 2009 and 2015, oil and gas producers vented, flared and leaked 462 bcf of natural gas on federal and indian lands, wasting as much as $23 million annually in royalty revenue. venting and leaks during oil and gas operations cause major emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. the rule would phase in a limit on flaring over several years affecting 16 percent of oil wells, which account for 87 percent of gas flared, the blm said. oil and gas operators can comply by expanding gas capture technology or connecting wells to existing infrastructure through gathering lines. operators would have to use technology such as infrared cameras to detect methane leaks, invisible to the naked eye. blm could also set and adjust royalty rates for oil and gas drilled on federal land to at or above 12.5 percent. currently blm has no discretion to raise the rate. “today’s announcement is a win for western taxpayers.  for too long, big oil companies have wasted natural gas that belongs to all americans with no accountability,” said chris saeger, director of ngo western values project. “blm is right to address methane waste from existing oil and gas facilities; these actions build on important state and federal progress already underway,” said fred krupp, president of the environmental defense fund. moments after the rule’s release, the western energy alliance and independent petroleum association of america filed a lawsuit against the blm in a wyoming court.

" republican presidential nominee donald trump’s support has sharply fallen in utah where a poll on wednesday showed him tied with democrat hillary clinton in a state that has voted republican in presidential races for decades.     the survey of 500 people from salt lake city based y2 analytics also showed a surge for evan mcmullin, an ex cia officer running as an independent.     trump and clinton were both at 26 percent while mcmullin, a member of the mormon faith that dominates in utah, trailed just behind at 22 percent. the telephone poll of likely voters was conducted on monday and tuesday, after a video featuring comments from trump about groping women surfaced last week.  the survey underscored the level of disaffection some conservatives have shown for trump, who has found himself at odds with much of the republican party establishment. the last time a republican presidential nominee lost in utah was in the landslide national election victory of president lyndon johnson, a democrat, in 1964. “there’s limits to partisanship even in utah of all places,” scott riding, managing partner of y2 analytics, said. the poll results indicate severe erosion in trump’s popularity in utah even as clinton’s support has grown slightly. a salt lake tribune poll in september put support for trump at 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for clinton. a number of prominent utah republicans, including governor gary herbert and u.s. senator mike lee, pulled their support for trump or called on him to quit the race.  mcmullin, a former cia counter terrorism specialist and investment banker whose campaign is based in utah, is less well known nationally than the other minor candidates, green party nominee jill stein and libertarian party nominee gary johnson. johnson ranked fourth in the y2 analytics poll with support from 14 percent of likely voters, roughly in line with his previous level of support in utah. mcmullin, who is running as a conservative independent, is on the ballot in a dozen states including utah, with plans to expand his reach before the nov. 8 election, according to his campaign spokesman rick wilson.  the vast majority of participants in the poll were familiar with the video tape of trump’s vulgar comments about women during a 2005 recording and a third of them said it lowered their opinion of the new york businessman. the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.

" president donald trump began talks with republican senators on tuesday to try to build consensus for proposed tax cuts in a meeting that was overshadowed by an exchange of insults between the president and one of the lawmakers. trump has asked his fellow republicans who control congress to pass a package of tax cuts, including a deep reduction in the corporate income tax, by year’s end.  but hours before he was to promote the tax plan at a weekly lunch for republican senators on capitol hill, trump engaged in a distracting tussle with one of those lawmakers: bob corker, a leading fiscal hawk and the head of the senate foreign relations committee.  “bob corker, who ... couldn’t get elected dog catcher in tennessee, is now fighting tax cuts,” trump wrote on twitter, later adding that the senator is “incompetent.” trump arrived at the capitol building with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for the lunch and gave a thumbs up to waiting reporters.  a protester threw a handful of small russian flags toward trump and shouted comments about accusations of collusion between his presidential campaign and moscow. both trump and russia deny colluding but a special counsel appointed by the u.s. justice department and congressional committees are looking into the matter. alienating any members of his own party could be costly for trump’s legislative initiatives in the senate because republicans control the chamber by just a slim 52 48 margin.     corker warned trump in television interviews against interfering in congressional efforts to finalize the legislation to cut taxes and called the president’s visit with senate republicans “a photo op.” “hopefully, the white house will step aside and let that occur in a normal process,” the tennessee republican told nbc’s “today” program. “that’s the best way for us to have success.” corker also described trump in a twitter post as “an utterly untruthful president,” and in television interviews accused trump of debasing the united states. house of representatives speaker paul ryan urged reporters to ignore the trump corker spat and concentrate on the tax plan. “put this twitter dispute aside. the fact is we have an historic chance of fixing this tax code,” ryan said. ryan added that he knows corker well and predicted that the senator is “going to vote for tax reform.” ryan said he wants the house to pass the republican tax cut bill by the nov. 23 u.s. thanksgiving holiday, echoing trump’s call to speed up the party’s efforts to get the measure approved before year’s end. cnbc reported that republicans plan to release their tax bill on nov. 1 after an expected house vote on thursday on a senate approved budget plan. house leaders are eager to get a tax bill voted on before the dec. 8 deadline for a possible government shutdown comes into view, as it is likely to distract from the tax overhaul, financial firm cowen and co. said in a research note.  “the senate time frame on taxes remains much more of a mystery with a senate finance draft likely in the late november/early december time frame,” cowen analyst chris krueger said.  securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to trump, who has yet to get major legislation through congress since taking office in january, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. tax cuts were another of trump’s campaign pledges.  the white house argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs, but has shown sensitivity in recent weeks to arguments that it is endangering america’s long term fiscal health.  trump said he believed the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from u.s. companies. “it’s going to bring back, i would say, $4 trillion back into this country,” trump told reporters in the oval office. “nobody even knows the amount,” trump said. market analysts estimate that about $2.6 trillion in profits is being held offshore by u.s. multinationals to avoid the current 35 percent u.s. corporate income tax. trump’s tax plan would require multinationals to bring in, or repatriate, those profits at a sharply reduced tax rate payable over several years. one of the key elements of the proposal is to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. while the broad parameters of the tax proposal have been made public, detailed legislation has not yet been unveiled. democrats have painted trump’s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate america that would balloon the federal deficit.  trump promised on monday to protect a popular retirement program as republican lawmakers seek ways to pay for the proposed cuts.

" eugene kaspersky, the ceo of the russian cybersecurity software firm that bears his name, had a big american dream.  he wanted his company to go beyond selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the u.s. government   one of the world’s biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools.  kaspersky set up a u.s. subsidiary, kgss, in arlington, virginia that would be focused on winning that business. he sponsored flashy conferences with high profile speakers  including michael flynn, who was briefly president donald trump’s national security adviser   sought to join u.s. trade groups and even underwrote programming on national public radio.  all of this was done to burnish kaspersky’s image and help it become an accepted vendor for the u.s. government despite its russian roots, according to people familiar with the strategy.  but eugene kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among u.s. intelligence officials that he and his company were, or could become, pawns of russia's spy agencies. kaspersky ""has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,"" the company said.  kaspersky’s american ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in u.s. russia relations following russia’s invasion of crimea in 2014, and later when u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia had hacked the 2016 u.s. presidential election.  testifying before the u.s. congress in may, u.s. intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that kaspersky products could be trusted.  fbi agents last month interviewed kaspersky employees, asking whether they reported to russia based executives and how much data from american customers could be seen by russian employees, according to three current and former employees. the fbi declined to comment on thursday.  on tuesday, the u.s. general services administration, the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy, removed kaspersky from a list of approved vendors, saying gsa’s mission was to ensure the security of u.s. government systems.  there is also a bill before congress that would explicitly bar the defense department from using any kaspersky products.  kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons.  “these reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition, slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys,” he said in a statement to reuters.   the arlington offices of kgss were empty when a reuters reporter visited them on thursday. a kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff, which number less than 10, often work from home.  the u.s. clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks.  two former employees and a person briefed on the fbi case told reuters that kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users’ machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals, even when those files were not corrupted by viruses.  “kaspersky lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations,” the kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email.  it is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing.  “this sets a really dangerous precedent” where other nations could make similar, unsubstantiated claims against u.s. vendors, said robert m. lee, a former cyberwarfare operative for u.s. intelligence and now ceo of cybersecurity startup dragos.  the russian government has denounced the kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures. officials at u.s. tech companies with significant operations in russia say they fear they could become targets.  federal contracting databases reviewed by reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from kaspersky, and an employee confirmed the company’s federal government revenue was “miniscule.”  but kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, u.s. officials say.  founded in 1997, kaspersky grew rapidly through the 2000s to become one of the world's leading anti virus software companies. (kaspersky's global reach: tmsnrt.rs/2uwtqov)  but the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to russia’s federal security service (fsb), the main successor to the kgb. eugene kaspersky attended a kgb school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the fsb.  as the company grew, kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears.  “we have to be more american than americans,” kaspersky told reuters in 2013, when a u.s. goodwill offensive began.  a cornerstone of the effort was a series of kgss hosted conferences in washington where prominent u.s. officials including flynn, a former defense intelligence agency director, former cia and nsa director michael hayden and house of representatives homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul discussed cybersecurity issues.  the company privately courted u.s. intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm, according to people present at those meetings.  “they came to us and said, ‘we want to change our image, we know people don’t trust us’,” said one former senior obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings.  but the suspicions never subsided. when the company sought to join one washington based technology trade organization, it was “politely told it couldn’t happen,” according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter.  the source said industry group officials had an inside joke: “kaspersky (membership) is like having the kremlin join.”  not coincidentally, kaspersky’s government sales effort never gained traction. in an email to reuters, the company noted “complexities associated with doing business with north america’s government sector.”  privately held kaspersky said its u.s. revenue, most of which comes from selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses, slipped from $164 million in 2014 to about $156 million in 2016.  some u.s. national security experts say kaspersky is being treated unfairly. lee said he has long been bothered by the “public shaming” of kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence.  the u.s. government has the right to choose not to use kaspersky products for any reason, he said, but “the way they are doing it” is wrong.  “i don’t believe in geographic restrictions that say, ‘because kaspersky is a russian based company, therefore it is bad,’” said former white house cybersecurity policy coordinator michael daniel. “you would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior.”  ",0
" it does not make sense for britain to retain the european union s charter of fundamental rights after it leaves the bloc, britain s brexit minister david davis said. parliament began debating legislation on thursday to sever political, financial and legal ties with the eu, but the opposition labour party has said it cannot support the bill without it being amended to better protect workers  rights.  we also do not believe it would make sense to retain the charter of fundamental rights,  davis told parliament.  the charter only applies to member states when acting within the scope of eu law. we will not be a member state nor will we be acting within the scope of eu law once we leave. he added:  the charter catalogues the rights found under eu law which will be brought into uk law by the bill. it is not, and never was, the source of those rights.

" new york city mayor bill de blasio will back a $2.5 billion plan to create a light rail service linking the city’s outer boroughs when he gives his annual keynote speech on thursday the 16 mile track would run from astoria in queens, tracing a line along the east river and new york’s upper harbor to link up with sunset park in brooklyn. it would pass through popular neighborhoods like williamsburg and brooklyn heights. the plan is not new but the mayor’s emphasis reflects the growing importance of the outer boroughs. it also makes good on his pledge to address the gap between wealthy manhattan and the rest of the city, a longstanding gripe with many new yorkers. “this is about equity and innovation. we are mapping brand new transit that will knit neighborhoods together,” de blasio said in a statement. the introduction of a light rail service would be a new development for the city. it would mirror the increasing use of such services in new jersey, especially connecting the growing commuter towns along the hudson river, an area real estate developers have dubbed the “gold coast.” the mayor’s office said the city will offset costs with tax revenues from increased property values along the proposed line.  major upgrades are being planned to aging transport infrastructure throughout the state. governor andrew cuomo has embraced around $100 billion of projects including a $20 billion rail tunnel under the hudson river. de blasio, who comes from the liberal wing of the democratic party, has emphasized social issues since taking office in 2014 such as free schooling for four year olds and reforming the city’s police. he will likely use thursday’s state of the city address to hone in on some of those issues. homelessness will likely be a focus after the mayor faced accusations he was not doing enough to address the problem.  de blasio is also likely to revisit public safety. he and his police commissioner, bill bratton, cited new statistics on wednesday showing this january was the safest ever.  de blasio shifted thursday’s speech to 7 p.m. from its usual daytime spot in the hope of reaching more new yorkers. it will be held at the lehman center for the performing arts, a concert venue in the bronx. (this version of the story corrects day of speech in paragraphs 1, 9 and 11) ",0
" it would not be a bad idea for the european central bank and other central banks to follow the u.s. federal reserve’s example and change course away from an ultra accommodative monetary policy, german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said. speaking on the sidelines of international monetary fund meetings in washington, schaeuble said the ultra loose monetary policies in place in many areas of the world were not helpful. “it is encouraging undue risk taking, political complacency, capital misallocation and asset price bubbles,” he added. “the fed has initiated the exit from loose monetary policy. it wouldn’t be a bad idea, if the european central bank and others were to start following this example,” he said. three ecb policymakers said on wednesday   days before a tense french presidential election and the ecb’s own policy meeting   that prospects for the euro zone economy had improved but the time to withdraw support has not yet come. investors are on tenterhooks before sunday’s first round vote in france, where two of the four leading candidates are threatening to leave the european union and the euro currency. any turmoil in the bond market after the french vote would push up borrowing costs for countries and companies   undoing some of the stimulus the ecb is providing   and even raise questions about the euro’s survival. while stressing that the ecb, and not the german government, sets monetary policy for the euro zone, schaeuble added: “it is true that the euro being undervalued, from a german perspective, benefits our exporters.” german officials have said schaeuble and his delegation will stress the importance of globalization and free trade for growth at the talks in washington this week, as well as the need for reforms to increase resilience against future shocks.

" indian prime minister narendra modi will discuss rising violence in myanmar s western rakhine state during a visit that begins on tuesday, and push for greater progress on long running indian infrastructure projects, officials said.  india seeks to boost economic ties with resource rich myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600 km (1,000 mile) border, to counter chinese influence and step up connectivity with a country it considers its gateway to southeast asia. two way trade has grown to around $2.2 billion as india courted myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but indian funded projects have moved slowly. modi s promises to  act east  and cement ties with india s eastern neighbor have slipped even as china has strengthened its influence. his first bilateral visit comes amid a spike in violence in rakhine, after a military counter offensive against insurgents killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of nearly 90,000 villagers to bangladesh since aug. 25. the violence could hit development of a transport corridor that begins in rakhine, with the indian built port of sittwe and includes road links to india s remote northeast, analysts said.  it s going to be a very vexed and complex issue,  said tridivesh singh maini, a new delhi based expert on ties with myanmar.  you need to play it very smartly. you need to make it clear that rakhine violence has regional implications... but india will not get into saying,  this is how you should resolve it.  last month, india said it wanted to deport 40,000 rohingya refugees who left myanmar in previous years. modi arrives from china late on tuesday in the capital naypyidaw to meet president htin kyaw on a three day visit. new delhi believes the best way to reduce tension in rakhine is through development efforts, such as the kaladan transport project there, said indian foreign ministry official sripriya ranganathan.      we are very confident that once that complete corridor is functional, there will be a positive impact on the situation in the state,  she told reporters. modi will meet myanmar leader aung san suu kyi and visit the heritage city of bagan and a hindu temple. the countries share close cultural ties, and several in myanmar trace their roots to india.  modi will also talk up a trilateral highway project connecting india s northeast with myanmar and thailand.  there is a fear that china is already going full steam ahead,  said udai bhanu singh of delhi think tank, the institute for defence studies and analyses.  from the indian side, there has been some laxity.   singh said india could offer myanmar help in building its navy and coastguard, while myanmar would seek assurances that india was a reliable economic partner and an alternative power to beijing.

" the u.s. state department said on tuesday that a new law allowing russia s justice ministry to list foreign media outlets as  foreign agents  posed a threat to free press and it urged moscow not to use the measure to tighten control over the media. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement on tuesday,  freedom of expression, including speech and media which a government may find inconvenient, is a universal human rights obligation russia has pledged to uphold.  she said russia s foreign agents law had been  used to justify a constant stream of raids, harassment, and legal proceedings that effectively obstruct non governmental organizations from doing their work.  the law, signed by president vladimir putin on saturday, allows moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources. the legislation was rushed through russia s parliament in two weeks after the united states required russian state broadcaster rt to register its u.s. based affiliate company as a  foreign agent.  nauert rejected any comparison between the u.s. and russian laws, saying the american law did not limit publication of information or restrict the organization s ability to operate. the move is part of the fallout from allegations that russia interfered in last year s u.s. presidential campaign to try to help donald trump win. u.s. intelligence officials have accused the kremlin of using russian media to influence u.s. voters. moscow has denied meddling in the u.s. election.  expanding the foreign agents law to include media outlets opens the door to onerous requirements that could further stifle freedom of speech and editorial independence in russia,  nauert said.

" russia threw its weight behind china s massive belt and road plan to build trade and transport links across asia and beyond, suggesting to india on monday that it find a way to work with beijing on the signature project.  india is strongly opposed to an economic corridor that china is building in pakistan that runs through disputed kashmir as part of the belt and road initiative.  india was the only country that stayed away from a may summit hosted by chinese president xi jinping to promote the plan to build railways, ports and power grids in a modern day recreation of the silk road. russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said new delhi should not let political problems deter it from joining the project, involving billions of dollars of investment, and benefiting from it. lavrov was speaking in the indian capital after a three way meeting with chinese foreign minister wang yi and indian foreign minister sushma swaraj at which, he said, india s reservations over the chinese project were discussed.  i know india has problems, we discussed it today, with the concept of one belt and one road, but the specific problem in this regard should not make everything else conditional to resolving political issues,  he said. russia, all the countries in central asia, and european nations had signed up to the chinese project to boost economic cooperation, he said.   those are the facts,  he said.  india, i am 100 percent convinced, has enough very smart diplomats and politicians to find a way which would allow you to benefit from this process.  the comments by russia, india s former cold war ally, reflected the differences within the trilateral grouping formed 15 years ago to challenge u.s. led dominance of global affairs. but substantial differences between india and china, mainly over long standing border disputes, have snuffed out prospects of any real cooperation among the three.  india, in addition, has drawn closer to the united states in recent years, buying weapons worth billions of dollars to replace its largely soviet origin military. swaraj said the three countries had very productive talks on economic issues and the fight against terrorism.

" christian groups asking the u.s. supreme court to exempt them from the requirement to provide insurance covering contraception under president barack obama’s healthcare law face an uphill battle following justice antonin scalia’s death last month. the remaining eight justices will consider seven related cases on whether nonprofit groups that oppose the requirement on religious grounds can object under a u.s. law called the religious freedom restoration act to a compromise version of the requirement offered by the obama administration. among those mounting objections are the little sisters of the poor, an order of roman catholic nuns that runs care homes for the elderly. the court, divided 4 4 between liberal and conservative justices without the conservative scalia, is set to hear the case on wednesday. scalia was considered a reliable vote for the religious groups. in 2014, he was in the majority when the court ruled 5 4 that family owned companies run on religious principles, including craft retailer hobby lobby stores inc, could object to the provision for religious reasons.  if the four conservatives who sided with scalia in that case remain unified, the best result the challengers could get would be a 4 4 split. that would leave in place lower court rulings that favored the obama administration. “unless the court’s four justices in the dissent in hobby lobby dramatically change their minds, the likely worst outcome for the government would be a 4 4 split,” said gregory lipper, a lawyer with americans united for separation of church and state, which filed a brief backing the obama administration. lawyers for the challengers forecast that they can win, citing among other things the fact that women can obtain alternative coverage via obamacare’s online marketplace. “the idea that the government doesn’t have some other way to do this is really a pretty silly argument,” said mark rienzi, a lawyer with the becket fund for religious liberty, which represents the little sisters. the christian groups object to a compromise first offered by the federal government in 2013. it allows groups opposed to providing insurance covering contraception on religious grounds to comply with the law without actually paying for the coverage required by the 2010 affordable care act, widely known as obamacare. groups can certify they are opting out by signing a form, which they submit to the government. the government then asks insurers to pick up the tab. the groups contend the accommodation infringes on their religious rights because it forces them to authorize the coverage for their employees, even if they are not paying for it. a ruling is due by the end of june.

" proposed senate legislation to impose sanctions on russia over allegations it tried to influence the u.s. presidential election are an attempt to prolong the harm already done to u.s. russian ties, the kremlin said on tuesday. “that’s the internal affair of the united states but we see continuing attempts to exclude any kind of dialogue between our two countries and attempts, blow by blow, to do further harm to the prospects for our bilateral relations,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters when asked about the legislation. republican senator john mccain and democratic senators ben cardin and robert menendez said on monday they would introduce legislation to impose “comprehensive” sanctions on russia over its attempts to influence the 2016 u.s. election. peskov said separate u.s. sanctions announced on monday, on several russian officials linked to the so called magnitsky affair, were fresh steps towards the “degradation of relations” between moscow and washington.

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s pick for attorney general, jeff sessions, promised on tuesday to stand up to trump, his close ally and future boss, saying he would oppose a ban on muslims entering the country and enforce a law against waterboarding even though he voted against the measure. questioned for 10 1/2 hours by a u.s. senate committee responsible for confirming his appointment, sessions, a u.s. senator from alabama, distanced himself from comments he had made defending trump from criticism over a 2005 video that emerged in october showing trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals. at the time, sessions told the weekly standard magazine he would not characterize the behavior as sexual assault. he later said the comments were taken out of context. asked on tuesday whether “grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent is ... sexual assault,” he replied: “clearly, it would be.” with 10 days to go before trump takes office, sessions, 70, was the first cabinet nominee to face questioning. he appeared before the senate judiciary committee. trump’s pick to run the department of homeland security, retired marine corps general john kelly, later went before the homeland security committee. as attorney general, sessions would serve as the top u.s. law enforcement officer and be responsible for giving unbiased legal advice to the president and executive agencies.     with that in mind, lawmakers from both trump’s republican party and the democratic party sought to establish how closely sessions hewed to trump positions and whether he could put aside his staunchly conservative political positions to enforce laws he may personally oppose.     a senator since 1997, sessions was widely expected to be confirmed by the republican controlled senate.  protesters accusing sessions of having a poor record on human rights interrupted the capitol hill proceedings several times. sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the united states on the basis of religion and that trump’s intentions were to restrict people from countries harboring terrorists, not all muslims. elected on nov. 8, trump at one point campaigned on a proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country.  sessions said he favored “higher intensity of vetting” for refugees seeking to enter the united states from countries that harbor terrorists but that he would oppose ending the u.s. refugee program. he also said he would enforce a 2015 law that outlawed waterboarding terrorism suspects even if it meant resisting trump. the senator said he had voted against the law, believing those in high positions in the military and intelligence community should be able to do so.    during the campaign, trump said waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is widely regarded as torture, was an effective technique and vowed to bring it back and make it “a hell of a lot worse.” more recently trump has said retired marine corps general james mattis, his nominee for secretary of defense, had persuasively argued against it.     sessions said he would enforce laws upheld by the u.s. supreme court, even those he disagreed with, such as decisions making abortion and same sex marriage legal. sessions said the comments he made during the 2016 presidential campaign about democrat hillary clinton’s email practices and charitable foundation would cloud the perception of impartiality if the justice department continued investigating clinton. he said he would recuse himself and favored a special prosecutor to carry out any future investigations.  trump, who defeated clinton, said during the campaign that if elected, he would ask his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to see that clinton go to prison for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and her relationship with her family’s charitable foundation.      sessions said he agreed with trump in opposing democratic president barack obama’s executive action that granted temporary protection to immigrant children brought to the country illegally by their parents and would not oppose overturning it. sessions, representing the deeply conservative southern state of alabama, has long opposed legislation that provides a path to citizenship for immigrants. he has also been a close ally of groups seeking to restrict legal immigration by placing limits on visas used by companies to hire foreign workers.  sessions said he would be more aggressive in investigating and prosecuting abuses of the h 1b visa program, which he said allows companies to discriminate against american workers by hiring foreigners.  as head of the justice department, the attorney general oversees the immigration court system that decides whether immigrants are deported or granted asylum or some other kind of protection. sessions renewed his criticism of the obama administration for not being tougher on countries that refuse to take back criminal migrants ordered deported from the united states.  a key plank of trump’s election campaign was his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico. kelly told his hearing a physical barrier on its own is not enough to keep people and drugs from illegally entering the united states. in written testimony, kelly said that “rapidly processing” and deporting immigrants in “significant numbers” would deter future illegal migration. the u.s. immigration court system has a backlog of over 500,000 cases awaiting a decision on deportation, asylum or some other kind of protection. many migrants arriving at the u.s. mexico border are given a notice to appear in court one to three years in the future.  before the judiciary committee, sessions several times defended himself against charges of racism. he said allegations that he harbored sympathies toward the ku klux klan, a violent white supremacist organization, were false.  “i abhor the klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,” sessions said in his opening remarks. sessions was denied confirmation to a federal judgeship in 1986 after allegations emerged that he made racist remarks, including testimony that he called an african american prosecutor “boy,” an allegation sessions denied.   democratic senator dianne feinstein said the senate judiciary committee had received letters from 400 civil rights organizations opposing his confirmation to the country’s top law enforcement post.

" republican lawmakers will begin voiding dozens of new u.s. regulations at the end of the month to fulfill their promise to undo democratic president barack obama’s legacy, focusing on environmental and labor rules, the house of representatives’  second most powerful republican said on thursday.  house majority leader kevin mccarthy said the republicans who will shortly control both congress and the white house for the first time in 10 years have made reforming federal regulation a top priority alongside repealing the obamacare healthcare program and rewriting the tax code. republicans are on a blitz to radically reform the vast federal bureaucracy, where they say appointed officials create costly, burdensome red tape that stifles economic growth. once republican president elect donald trump is inaugurated on jan. 20, they will have a like minded ally in the oval office to sign their measures into law. on the chopping block are dozens of new rules that the outgoing obama administration has finalized since the end of may on energy, the environment, transportation, banking, finance, education and media ownership. republicans will ax them using the congressional review act, which allows congress to void a single regulation for a brief window of time after it is issued.   congress will begin a two week marathon of voting to disapprove them on jan. 30, according to mccarthy, who house aides say will lead the process. disapproval resolutions can pass on simple majorities, giving senate democrats no power to block votes with filibusters. mccarthy told the conservative leaning hoover institution that two of the first votes will be on new environmental regulations. republicans will seek to kill a contentious rule intended to protect streams and forests from the impact of coal mining and a regulation curbing methane leaks on public lands. congress will also take aim at new requirements for employers to report their workers’ gender, race and ethnicity that are intended to help root out pay discrimination. on wednesday, the house approved a massive bill for creating accountability in rulemaking. the next day, it passed legislation largely along party lines requiring financial regulators to tally the costs of their rules. democrats, though, have vowed to block any reform bills, saying the many extra procedures they require will stall agencies’ work, making it impossible to create needed regulations and properly oversee special interests.

" two groups that support far reaching curbs on legal immigration to the united states and ideological screening of would be immigrants to test their beliefs say donald trump’s presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy. numbersusa and the center for immigration studies, which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration, told reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year. trump’s campaign declined to confirm the meetings. trump, the republican nominee, has won over millions of supporters with his calls for a wall on the mexican border and a temporary ban on muslims entering the country. but the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad.  while trump’s immigration proposals push the republican party sharply to the right, numbersusa and cis also want to slash legal immigration, going beyond the new york businessman’s call to keep it “within historical norms.” numbersusa says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth, take jobs that should go to u.s. workers, and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats.  “the aim should be to halt all immigration possible,” numbersusa head roy beck wrote in a blog in march. numbersusa wants to cut legal immigration to 500,000 a year immediately, said chris chmielenski, the group’s director of content and activism. about a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the united states every year, according to the u.s. department of homeland security. around 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the united states in 2014, down from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to the pew research center. the head of cis, mark krikorian, has argued against legal immigration extensively. last year he wrote in the national review that mass legal immigration would end u.s. conservatism, because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights. beck told reuters he had met with trump in new york and had also spoken with people “at the top” of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn, when numbersusa accepted invitations to meet several republican presidential hopefuls. much of the contact was by phone and email. beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions. in early august, numbersusa shared a 10 point immigration plan with the trump campaign. of the 10 points, six were echoed by trump in a major immigration speech on aug. 31. those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the “e verify” system to check a job applicant’s legal status.  the trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap. the policy was written with input from senator jeff sessions of alabama, former new york mayor rudy giuliani, as well as immigration and customs enforcement officers and border patrol agents. beck said the overlap showed the “convergence” of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had “no indication that they sat down and looked at our 10 steps and said let’s take six of them.”     based in arlington, virginia, numbersusa describes itself as the “the nation’s largest grassroots immigration reduction organization with more than 5 million participants.” it is credited with helping block immigration bills in 2007 and 2013 that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens. krikorian, of cis, whose slogan is “low immigration, pro immigrant,” said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the trump campaign for months.  in an aug. 15 speech, trump outlined his plan for “extreme vetting” of immigrants, calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people “who share our values and respect our people.”  cis was an early proponent of ideological screening   widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought   to protect u.s. culture and national security following the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was unclear if trump consulted cis on the idea. the department of homeland security already requires people seeking legal status in the united states to show they adhere to the principles of the constitution. krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at trump’s new york headquarters in august, after which he said he was asked by trump’s campaign to be a “surrogate.” a surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign, by speaking at rallies and other events. krikorian said he turned down the trump campaign’s request.  hate watchdog groups like the southern poverty law center and the anti defamation league have accused numbersusa and cis of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism. “these are the organizations that are the leading edge of the nativist movement in this country,” said frank sharry, executive director of immigrants’ rights group america’s voice.  both organizations reject the claims. “we’re absolutely opposed to nativism,” said beck, adding that numbersusa’s recommendations come from a desire to protect american workers. his group stresses that it blames bad immigration policy and not immigrants themselves. krikorian said cis wants “an ethnically neutral policy that lets in fewer people in the future and does a better job of welcoming those people we do legally admit to our country.” (adds dropped word, “plan,” in paragraph 14.)

" the latest lawyer hired to represent u.s. president donald trump in the federal investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election is an ex marine who likens some cases to war. “i fight hard,” john dowd said in an interview. “i believe that’s what i’m supposed to do. i am not a snowflake, i can tell you that.” “snowflake” is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some trump supporters to mock liberals. dowd, who spoke with reuters on wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. he has a no holds barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional democrats and the media. the 76 year old washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of akin gump strauss hauer & feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to trump’s legal team.  the team, led by new york lawyer marc kasowitz, is tasked with responding to robert mueller, the special counsel named by the justice department to probe whether anyone associated with trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with russian officials or others with ties to the kremlin. russian officials have denied meddling in the u.s. election, and trump denies any collusion by his campaign. in what dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended  billionaire hedge fund founder raj rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time.  rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. former assistant u.s. attorney reed brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence. “this is war, and i will defeat you,” brodsky recalled dowd declaring in one phone conversation. dowd confirmed the sentiment on wednesday. “it is a war,” he said of such cases. his tactics in the rajaratnam case reflected that belief. dowd aggressively challenged the prosecution’s stance on what constituted insider trading. he also fought the government’s wiretaps of his client’s cell phone, claiming investigators “gamed the system.”   brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6 foot 4 inch tall dowd would be a “ferocious defender of the president.”  in a manner similar to trump, dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the federal bureau of investigation during the rajaratnam case, singling out then manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara in particular.  “he sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs,” dowd said. “it was the most atrocious thing i’ve ever seen.” dowd also went after reporters. bharara, who declined to comment on wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a wall street journal reporter he accused of “whoring” for the prosecution. in another encounter with the press caught on camera, dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a cnbc reporter.    like trump, dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. after the rajaratnam verdict, dowd argued “the defense is winning” because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading. “the score is 23 14,” he told reporters. in a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of u.s. attorneys, dowd complained of mccarthyism when his client, former justice department official monica goodling, was criticized by democrats for invoking the fifth amendment against self incrimination. dowd represented u.s. senator john mccain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s “keating five” banking scandal and conducted the major league baseball investigation that led to former hall of famer pete rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the cincinnati reds. dowd would not discuss legal strategy for trump but said the team the president had assembled was great. “we’re all fighters,” he said.  though his hiring was first reported friday, a person familiar with the matter said dowd has been working with the team for weeks. dowd said he knew kasowitz partner michael bowe, who is also representing trump, and met with kasowitz at the end of may. jay sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on trump’s behalf. dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. he called trump “a fighter for the people” and said the president had done nothing wrong. a onetime military lawyer with the u.s. marine corps, dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize mueller, a marine platoon leader during the vietnam war. “bobby is doing what he has to do and he’ll do a good job,” said dowd. “he’s a fellow marine and he’s a good man.” ",0

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on thursday there could be an opportunity for talks between north korea and the united states if pyongyang stopped testing and developing its nuclear and missile programs. “so long as they stop testing, stop developing, they don’t export their weapons, there would be opportunity for talks,” mattis told reporters on a military plane. while washington has said that all options, including military, are on the table in dealing with north korea, it has stressed its preference is for a diplomatic solution. visiting seoul last week, u.s. president donald trump warned north korea he was prepared to use the full range of american military power to stop any attack, but also urged pyongyang to “make a deal.”  trump, who had previously called negotiations with north korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks. pyongyang has made clear it has little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. the last north korean missile test was carried out almost two months ago, but u.s. officials say they have seen no signs that pyongyang has stopped development. mattis said the u.s. military was closely watching why there had been no missile launches recently, but declined to give potential reasons for it.  there are concerns in south korea that any potential u.s. strikes against north korea’s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating north korean retaliation against south korea. earlier this week, a senior south korean official said trump should “under no circumstances” take military action against north korea without the consent of the government in seoul. in colorado, mattis will visit the u.s. northern command and the north american aerospace defense command (norad), which are responsible for homeland defense, including tracking and potentially intercepting north korean missiles.

" tensions among republicans about president donald trump boiled over on tuesday as two senators accused trump of debasing u.s. politics and the country’s standing abroad, a rebellion that could portend trouble for his legislative agenda. the extraordinary public criticism of the president from jeff flake and bob corker further strained what had already been a fraught relationship between trump and fellow republicans as they try to enact tax reform and other policy items. in an emotional speech on the senate floor, flake repeatedly targeted trump’s style of governing, saying american politics had become “inured” to “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior from the white house. “the instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward looking people,” said the arizona lawmaker, who announced he would not run for re election next year. “i will not be complicit or silent,” flake said. trump, via twitter, has been unrelenting in his criticism of corker and flake, accusing them of supporting democratic priorities, and using sometimes slashing language, such as his dismissal of corker as “liddle bob corker.” by announcing he will be leaving when his term ends in early 2019, flake effectively freed himself up to speak his mind, without having one eye on voter reactions in his home state.  a morning consult survey conducted sept. 24 to oct. 24 said flake had an approval rating in arizona of 30 percent. corker, who has also said he is not running for re election in tennessee, accused trump of telling falsehoods that could be easily proven wrong and willfully damaging the country’s standing in the world, eviscerating the president with comments that stirred deepening divisions in the republican party. “you would think he would aspire to be the president of the united states and act like a president of the united states, but that’s not going to be the case apparently,” corker told reporters. “i’ve seen no evolution in an upward way. in fact, i would say, he’s almost devolved.” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders dismissed the comments from flake and corker and said trump wanted senators who could make progress on his policy goals. “he wants people to be in the senate that are committed to actually moving the ball down the field, and i don’t think these two individuals necessarily have been as focused on that,” she told reporters. republican congressional leaders who have learned to tread carefully amid controversies surrounding trump, largely stayed on the sidelines of the latest fight. “we’re going to concentrate on what our agenda is and not any of these other distractions that you all may be interested in,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters. republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan played down corker’s criticism of trump, urging reporters to “put this twitter dispute aside.” great american pac, a pro trump political group, declared victory over flake and sent out a fund raising appeal. “senator flake wisely decided to give up on his own terms rather than fight a losing battle for re election and have the voters retire him at the ballot box next year,” said the group’s top strategist, ed rollins. the president is seeking to build consensus around proposed tax cuts. republicans control both chambers of congress, but hold just a 52 48 majority in the senate. securing passage of his tax cut plan is critically important to trump, who has yet to get major legislation through congress since taking office in january. trump visited the capitol on tuesday for a policy lunch that was described by participants as productive. over the summer, trump pilloried senate republicans   as a group and some by name   after they failed to generate sufficient votes to repeal and replace the 2010 affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, one of his top presidential campaign promises. the dollar lost ground on news that flake would not seek re election because it added to investor worries about the fate of the tax plan, which has widely been seen as a potential boost to american companies. it recovered after a bloomberg report that trump asked senators at a closed door lunch whom they would support to become the next federal reserve chairman. bloomberg quoted one senator as saying that john taylor, viewed in the markets as an inflation hawk, got the most votes. trump has also provoked the ire of another respected senior republican, senator john mccain, whose war record he mocked during last year’s campaign. last week, former republican president george w. bush, who has kept a low profile since leaving office in january 2009, took a thinly veiled swipe at trump in a speech in which he decried “bullying and prejudice” and denounced anti immigrant sentiment.

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration has billed his move to re open federal lands to new coal leases as a win for miners seeking to expand production. but a review of company filings shows that coal miners with the most to gain already have enough leases in hand to last well over a decade.  trump will sign a decree on tuesday to reverse former president barack obama’s 2016 ban on new federal coal leases, part of a wide ranging executive order to sweep away green regulations his administration says have hobbled the drilling and mining industries.  “when we evaluate energy, let’s look at the social cost of not having a job,” trump’s interior secretary ryan zinke said in a twitter post on tuesday ahead of the executive order.  but companies focused on coal deposits below federal lands, such as peabody energy, arch coal, and cloud peak, have enough coal in the ground on existing leases to last an average of more than 17 years at 2015 sales levels, earnings reports show.  that suggests miners could already ramp up production levels immediately if the market demanded more coal. energy experts say that is unlikely on a large scale due to stiff competition from cheap and abundant natural gas.  “these initiatives prevent things from getting worse for coal, but they won’t help much,” said charles dayton, vice president of market analytics at doyle trading consultants in colorado, which has been tracking reserve levels on public lands.  shares in cloud peak were up about 3 percent in early trading on tuesday, ahead of the executive order, with peabody up 1.5 percent and arch down 0.3 percent.  the current level of reserves appeared to be within historical norms. a decade ago, under republican president george w. bush when there were no bans on federal coal leasing, the industry had about 18 years worth of leases on federal lands, according to a reuters examination of securities filings.  arch coal and peabody confirmed they have substantial reserves on their federal leases already, but nonetheless welcomed trump’s move.  “peabody has a comfortable amount of reserves in the powder river basin, although we recognize the poor public policy represented by the leasing moratorium put into place by the prior administration,” peabody spokesman vic svec told reuters in an email.  arch coal has “sufficient permitted reserves to sustain our operations on federal lands for a number of years to come,” spokeswoman logan bonacorsi said. “but as with all producers we will need to add reserves over time, and the ability to obtain those reserves when needed is important.”  officials at peak and contura did not respond to requests for comment.  trump’s executive order will also seek to undo obama era rules limiting carbon emissions. one example is the clean power plan, a regulation that would have increased pressure on states to replace coal fired power stations with ones using cleaner fuels like natural gas, wind and solar.  obama’s administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in january 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review to ensure royalties from lease deals provide fair returns to taxpayers.  it was not immediately clear whether the royalty review would continue even with the ban on leases lifted. some analysts said this scenario could trigger a near term land rush by companies fearing higher royalty rates in the future.  coal accounts for about a third of u.s. electricity production, down from about half a decade ago. about 40 percent of all u.s. coal comes from federal lands, mainly in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana.  luke popovich, a spokesman for the national mining association industry group, said he expected trump’s executive order to have symbolic impact, at least.  “lifting the moratorium would strengthen the signal to markets that the federal government is not any longer standing in the way of fossil energy,” he said.  he added that re opening federal lands to new leases could also play into a production upswing if demand ultimately increases. the u.s. energy information administration has forecast a 9 percent increase in western coal production to 443.4 million short tons by 2018, driven mainly by higher natural gas prices.  others were less optimistic about the u.s. coal industry’s outlook, saying the best trump could do is slow the sector’s decline. since 2012, coal production has plunged more than 25 percent to the lowest levels since 1978 due to falling prices. the industry has been hit with massive layoffs and bankruptcies.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on wednesday: the republican chairman of the house of representatives intelligence committee says some of trump’s personal communications may have been caught up in “incidental” surveillance involving a foreign power in the months after the election. the main investigative panel of the house of representatives has asked the white house and the fbi for documents regarding former national security adviser michael flynn’s foreign contacts with russia, turkey and others, its republican chairman and democratic counterpart say. trump and republican congressional leaders appear to be losing the battle to gather enough support in the house of representatives to pass their obamacare rollback bill, watched by wary investors in financial markets. secretary of state rex tillerson, speaking at a meeting of countries fighting islamic state, says the united states will set up “interim zones of stability” to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against islamic state and al qaeda. u.s. led coalition aircraft drops fighters for the first time into an area near the syrian city of raqqa to retake territory from islamic state in a mission that includes artillery and special operations troops. supreme court nominee neil gorsuch says presidents must obey court orders and expresses uncertainty about language in the constitution barring u.s. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as democrats grill him on issues involving trump. labor secretary nominee r. alexander acosta tells a senate committee he will abide by trump’s directive to review a pending “fiduciary rule” for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. the senate foreign relations committee will meet with secretary of state rex tillerson to discuss the administration’s proposed budget, the panel’s chairman says, after heated opposition in congress to trump’s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. a new york state judge is ordering exxonmobil corp to work with new york’s attorney general to recover lost emails from an account used by tillerson when he was the oil company’s chief executive. the senate takes up a measure to repeal regulations adopted by the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc.

" u.s. senator bernie sanders brought his strategy of trying to reenergize the democratic party by lending his star power to lower level races to a small city just outside boston on monday, with a stop to endorse candidates for alderman and city council. sanders, an independent who ran for the democratic party nomination in the 2016 presidential election, announced his support for a dozen candidates backed by “our revolution” a group formed by supporters of sanders’ campaign to boost progressive, liberal candidates. it is unusual for a politician with sanders’ profile to weigh in on races with no serious republican contenders, political observers said.   “the local level, more than any other level, is a way to involve people in the political process,” sanders said in  somerville, massachusetts, a city of 80,000 people. sanders last week pointed to the appearance as one of a series to try to build enthusiasm for lower level elections. sanders served four terms as mayor of burlington, vermont, before being elected to the senate. his remarks on monday mirrored his 2016 stump speeches, without directly addressing the candidates he was supporting in somerville and neighboring cambridge. political observers said sanders, and the candidates he endorsed, will face a challenge in translating the enthusiasm his campaign generated into votes for lower level races. in the city’s last municipal election that followed a presidential race, one in four registered voters, some 10,241 people, cast ballots. three out of four who voted in last year’s hillary clinton donald trump presidential matchup. “sanders envisioned his candidacy as a launching pad for nothing short of a revolution within the democratic party,” said jeffrey berry, a professor of political science at nearby tufts university. “the energy is more around ‘how do we fight trump’ than it is ‘how do we create a democratic party in the image of bernie sanders.’” sanders may not need to tip too many voters to influence the typically low turnout city races. in the 2013 ward races, just two candidates secured more than 1,000 votes and the four closest races were decided by an average of 166 votes. “it’s definitely a draw and i think it’s important that he is supporting local candidates,” said ellora derenoncourt, a 30 year old graduate student who was out to show her support for alderman candidate j.t. scott, a gym owner in his first race. the event did attract some undecided voters who said sanders’ endorsement would sway their picks among fields of democratic candidates. “our country has moved so far to their right since the mid 90s that just being a democrat doesn’t necessarily qualify you as a liberal or progressive,” said pamela massey, 59, of cambridge. nina turner, a former ohio state senator who serves as president of our revolution, acknowledged that the group faced a challenge in drumming up enthusiasm for down ticket races. “we have to try,” turner said. “we have to remind people that they have an obligation to participate and so often the level of vitriol that is put out the national level can have a negative effect.” ",0

" canada, which has been accused of sharing intelligence that led to the torture of prisoners abroad, on monday issued rules to prevent its security agencies from disclosing or requesting information from other countries if it would result in mistreatment. the rules also prohibit canada s spy agency, border services agents and federal police from using information likely obtained through torture, unless it is necessary to prevent death or significant injuries. the directions replace 2011 rules put in place by the previous conservative government that was replaced by prime minister justin trudeau s liberals in 2015. the liberals appear to have publicized the rules to repair the government s reputation, according to experts who noted that it is unusual for a country to publicly disclose such guidelines.  canada has taken the lead in this regard, partly because it has been stung by past history,  said university of ottawa professor wesley wark. in one high profile case, the conservative government in 2007 apologized and paid c$10.5 million to compensate maher arar, who was deported to syria by u.s. agents after canadian police mistakenly labeled him an islamic extremist.  earlier this year, canada apologized to three canadian men of arab descent who said they had been tortured in syria and blamed canadian secret services for their ordeal. the canadian security intelligence service, the royal canadian mounted police and the canada border services agency will be prohibited from disclosing or requesting information that would result in a  substantial risk of mistreatment,  the government said. information that was likely obtained through torture also cannot be used if there is a risk it would lead to further mistreatment.  the government of canada unequivocally condemns in the strongest possible terms the mistreatment of any individual by anyone for any purpose,  public safety minister ralph goodale said in a statement. alex neve, secretary general of amnesty international canada, said the clearer rules were an improvement over the previous directions that allowed for information to be shared with other countries in exceptional circumstances.  there s been a lot of pressure in canada over the last several years as the previous guidelines came to light and all of the inadequacies in those guidelines gathered quite a bit of concern,  said neve.

" republican presidential front runner donald trump, who frequently touts his opposition to the iraq war, appeared to support the idea in a newly unearthed 2002 interview, but said on thursday he became an opponent by the time the invasion occurred. in the interview before the war began, which was republished by buzzfeed on thursday, radio personality howard stern asked trump if he supported invading iraq. “yeah i guess so,” trump said, according to the audio clip. during a town hall event in south carolina on thursday, trump said the interview was not relevant because his views changed before the invasion. “by the time the war started, i was against it, and shortly after, i was really against it,” he said.    the billionaire businessman and former reality tv star, who leads the field seeking the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama, has cited his opposition to the 2003 invasion of iraq as evidence of his foreign policy credentials. but his criticism of former republican president george w. bush’s actions has aggravated some in his party, including in south carolina, which holds its republican primary on saturday. trump’s comments on thursday came after a participant at the cnn event said he was “stung” when the real estate mogul in a recent republican debate accused bush of lying about the reasons to go to war. he was referring to allegations, later proven false, that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.  trump walked back that criticism, saying the reasons for going to war were unclear. but he said the invasion was not justified and contributed to the destabilization of the middle east. “going into iraq, it may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made, in the history of this country. that’s how bad it is,” trump said.

" u.s. president elect donald trump on wednesday endorsed a niece of former critic mitt romney to be the next chair of the republican national committee as he moved to put his stamp on the party leadership. the rnc named michigan republican party chair ronna romney mcdaniel as its deputy chair, and trump said he looked forward to her taking over the party leadership. trump’s incoming white house chief of staff, reince priebus, will leave the rnc chairmanship when trump takes office on jan. 20. “i’m excited to have a highly effective leader in ronna mcdaniel as rnc deputy chair and i look forward to her serving as the party’s chairman in 2017,” trump said in a statement. “ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in michigan, and i know she will bring the same passion to the republican national committee,” he added. the rnc’s 168 elected members will convene in january to elect their next chairman and trump’s endorsement of mcdaniel will likely carry enough weight to get her elected. mcdaniel’s profile rose in trump’s view when she helped him win michigan in the nov. 8 election. the state had not voted republican in a presidential election since 1988 and was critical to trump’s victory over democrat hillary clinton. her selection came two days after trump passed over mitt romney to be his secretary of state, instead choosing exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson. trump and romney have gotten past their frictions during the republican presidential nominating battle when the 2012 republican nominee was critical of trump’s candidacy. bob paduchik, a veteran republican operative in ohio who was trump’s campaign manager in that state, was named deputy co chair of the rnc. trump’s victory in ohio was also crucial to his victory.

" u.s. central intelligence agency director mike pompeo said on saturday he sent a letter to iranian major general qassem soleimani and iranian leaders expressing concern regarding iran s increasingly threatening behavior in iraq. speaking during a panel at the annual reagan national defense forum in southern california, pompeo said he sent the letter after the senior iranian military commander had indicated that forces under his control might attack u.s. forces in iraq. he did not specify the date.  what we were communicating to him in that letter was that we will hold he and iran accountable for any attacks on american interests in iraq by forces that are under their control,  pompeo told the panel.   we wanted to make sure he and the leadership in iran understood that in a way that was crystal clear.   soleimani, who is the commander of foreign operations for iran s elite revolutionary guards, refused to open the letter, according to pompeo, who took over the cia in january.  iranian media earlier quoted mohammad mohammadi golpayegani, a senior aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, as saying an unnamed cia contact had tried to give a letter to soleimani when he was in the syrian town of albu kamal in november during the fighting against islamic state.  i will not take your letter nor read it and i have nothing to say to these people,  golpayegani quoted soleimani as saying, according to the semi official news agency fars.  reuters reported in october that soleimani had repeatedly warned kurdish leaders in northern iraq to withdraw from the oil city of kirkuk or face an onslaught by iraqi forces and allied iranian backed fighters, and had traveled to iraq s kurdistan region to meet kurdish leaders.  the presence of soleimani on the frontlines highlights tehran s heavy sway over policy in iraq, and comes as shi ite iran seeks to win a proxy war in the middle east with its regional rival and u.s. ally, sunni saudi arabia. a u.s. led coalition has been fighting islamic state in iraq and syria and is often in proximity to iran allied militia fighting isis there.   you need to only look to the past few weeks and the efforts of the iranians to exert influence now in northern iraq in addition to other places in iraq to see that iranian efforts to be the hegemonic power throughout the middle east continues to increase,  pompeo said. the cia chief said saudi arabia had grown more willing to share intelligence with other middle eastern nations regarding iran and islamist extremism. the israeli government said last month that israel had covert contacts with saudi arabia amid common concerns over iran, a first disclosure by a senior official from either country of long rumored secret dealings.  we ve seen them work with the israelis to push back against terrorism throughout the middle east, to the extent we can continue to develop those relationships and work alongside them   the gulf states and broader middle east will likely be more secure,  said pompeo.

[nl8n1md2v9] polls show the center left likely to be overtaken at the next election by the far right jobbik party, seen as leaning even further towards ethnic nationalism than orban s fidesz.  we need to work for four more years to strengthen our achievements to the point that they are irreversible,  orban said. the 54 year old premier has been widely criticized by western allies for eroding democratic freedoms, which he and fidesz deny. he has become unassailably popular at home, especially since 2015, when hungary became the main land route into the eu for around a million middle eastern migrants who crossed the balkans on their way to germany and other rich countries further north. orban and fidesz say hostility towards them is being whipped up as part of a conspiracy by george soros, a hungarian american financier who has long contributed to  open society  causes around the world, including in his native eastern europe. in his speech accepting his party s endorsement, orban said he was fighting against  globalist  views that threaten the eu s christian nations and their moral foundations, for which he blamed soros.  some countries in europe decided to transcend christianity and their own national character,  he said.  they want to step into a post christian, post national era.   to execute soros s plan they want to root out governments which represent national interests around europe, and that includes us,  he said.  they act like soviet agitprop agents once did. we old war horses know them by their smell.

" senior mexican diplomats on monday condemned the upcoming execution of a mexican inmate on death row in texas, calling his sentence  illegal  and vowing to exhaust all possible efforts to prevent him from being killed later this week. in a news conference in mexico city, carlos sada, mexico s deputy foreign minister for north america, told reporters that texas prosecutors did not follow due process in the case of ruben cardenas, who was sentenced to death for raping and killing his 15 year old cousin in 1997.  from the start, there has been a failure, and from our perspective, this is an illegal act,  sada said. the planned execution comes as relations between mexico and the united states are at a low, hurt by u.s. president donald trump s vows to build a wall along the mexican border, and his threats to end the north american free trade agreement (nafta). cardenas, who is due to die on wednesday, was not given the chance to speak with consular officials in contravention of the vienna convention on consular relations, sada said. he added mexico would look to stay the execution by seeking to overturn how cardenas  confession was obtained, while also looking to exonerate him with up to date dna testing. there are currently two separate appeals under way and mexico is willing to take cardenas  case all the way to the u.s. supreme court if necessary, sada added. mexico does not have the death penalty and opposes it, regularly clashing with the united states when mexican nationals are set to be executed on u.s. soil. sada said 54 mexicans were currently facing u.s. death sentences.  the international court of justice (icj) in the hague ruled in 2004 that the united states had violated international law by failing to inform 51 mexicans now on death row of their right to consular assistance, and said the cases should be reviewed. alejandro alday, a legal advisor to the mexican government, said cardenas was one of the 51 covered by the icj ruling, and accused texas of breaching the vienna convention in failing to advise cardenas of his right to consular assistance.

" the brother of a franco algerian gunman who killed four jews and three soldiers was sentenced to 20 years in jail on thursday over a killing spree that heralded an era of islamist inspired attacks in which hundreds have since died in france. a court in paris ruled abdelkader merah guilty of terrorist offences. he was found to have helped in the preparation of the attacks although he did not participate himself when his younger brother mohamed merah shot three jewish children and one of their parents, and then three soldiers, in toulouse in 2012. more than 240 people have been killed in france since then, primarily since early 2015. the biggest was a string of islamist attacks in which gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 in paris. prosecutors had asked the court to sentence abdelkader merah to life behind bars, arguing that he was a religious radical who had mentored his younger brother and helped materially, notably in the theft of the scooter used in the killings at the jewish ozer hatorah school in toulouse, southwestern france. the judge sentenced the defendant to 20 years. a second man, fettah malki, was sentenced to 14 years for his role in providing the gun, ammunition and a bullet proof vest to the attacker.  mohamed merah, 24 at the time, was shot dead when he jumped, guns blazing, from the window of an apartment where he was holed up a few days after his killing spree in march 2012. the merah killings were the first major incident of the kind  since paris subway bombs attacks in the mid 1990s by islamist militants linked to the gia group in algeria, a former french colony.  abdelkader merah denied being involved during a four week trial where his lawyer demanded acquittal and accused public prosecutors of going after him because they could no longer pursue his brother. for the prosecution, french attorney general na ma rudloff said when pleading for a life sentence that there was no doubt the older brother was guilty and devoted much of his time to mentoring his sibling.  abdelkader merah made mohamed merah,  she said. at the time of the killings, interior minister claude gueant said the younger merah, who had both french and algerian citizenship, had claimed affiliation with the al qaeda militant group and said he wanted to avenge palestinian children. he had been under surveillance by the intelligence service for several years after being identified in afghanistan. at home in toulouse he was better known by for his love of soccer, night clubs and motorbikes than any conspicuous religious devotion.

"  we speak our mind , says the website of a group of young cambodians who have met at weekends for the past six years to discuss politics over mugs of coffee. but discussions by the politikoffee group were postponed indefinitely by the organizers after the main opposition party was dissolved last week at the request of authoritarian prime minister hun sen s government. for participants, the suspension of their meetings because of the difficult environment was just one more sign of debate being shut down in what has been one of southeast asia s most open societies.  people are sensitive in talking about politics or talking about what the government is doing right now,  said noan sereiboth, 28, a researcher for health projects who was a regular attendee at the politikoffee gatherings.  sometimes people s parents tell them not to talk about politics to stay safe,  he said. the arrest of opposition leader kem sokha for alleged treason in september and the ban on his party have eliminated the main obstacles to hun sen extending more than three decades in power in a general election next year. but the crackdown by the government has been felt much deeper: to once vocal civil society groups nurtured by western donors, to independent media and to anyone posting subversive comment on social media.  local ngos have been paralyzed and scattered,  said naly pilorge of the licadho human rights group, which has a long record of reporting on detentions and land seizures.  people say space is shrinking. it s not shrinking, it s closed,  she told reuters at her office in phnom penh. three other groups declined to comment or did not respond to requests for official comment. it was not lost on the groups that their names featured as associates of the opposition during testimony at the supreme court on banning the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp), which was accused of plotting a revolution with american help. the opposition says there was never a plot, dismissing accusations as a ploy to eliminate hun sen s rival. the government said nobody had reason to fear in a country that has been transformed since the devastation wrought by the khmer rouge genocide in the 1970s.      everyone has full freedom of expression in every way,  said huy vannak, undersecretary of state at the interior ministry.  we have long graduated from fear.  civil rights groups and other non governmental organizations flourished in cambodia with the help of western countries that hoped to build a liberal democracy after the first multiparty elections in 1993. that brought a more open environment than in neighboring countries such as communist vietnam and laos or military ruled thailand, with its harsh sentences for criticizing the monarchy. but western donors lack the weight they one had in cambodia and hun sen has brushed of their criticism of the crackdown. china is now the biggest aid giver. since the ban on the cnrp, it has voiced support for cambodia in the name of protecting political stability and economic development. politikoffee, which gets speakers from all sides for its debates, said that postponing its recent events because of the difficult environment did not mean it was giving up.  we hope we can weather the dramatically changing political order,  team leader aun chhengpor told reuters.  the forum will be back in place soon.  although the debates among a few dozen participants cost little to organize, politikoffee uses space provided by the konrad adenauer stiftung, a german pro democracy group which said it had no say over the group s discussions. the political troubles are not evident in the daily bustle of phnom penh, capital of a country of 16 million people which has recorded economic growth of around seven percent for the past six years. but few wish to speak about politics.  we must just keep quiet and let it pass,  said chrock soth, 46, who just about makes a living selling bananas from his bicycle on the outskirts of the city. in an informal survey of more than 30 people in and around phnom penh, traditionally a stronghold of the opposition, roughly half declined to comment on the situation or said they did not care about politics. the rest were unhappy, but said they could do nothing.  youths care about politics,  noan sereiboth said.  but in the current situation they can t do anything except watch.

" freedom is not a gift from government. it is a gift from god.    president donald j. trump, may 4, 2017the little sisters correctly insist that sterilizations, abortifacient chemical birth control and artificial contraception are all immoral. they are not only against the teaching of the scripture and christian tradition but, as catholics, the sisters also maintain that they violate the natural moral law.the obama administration has asked the court to compel these little sisters of the poor to do indirectly what they refuse to do directly. they asked the court to force catholic nuns to sin, to act against conscience, to pursue an immoral course of action. the nuns were placed in a situation reminiscent of other times in the history of the church when unjust rulers sought to compel the church to bend the knee to caesar.here are what the little sisters of the poor are all about. one look at these lovely women who have devoted their lives to god and to helping others in need, and you will see why president trump made helping them live their faith without fear of persecution a priority:president donald trump signed a religious liberty executive order today that would protect christian organizations like the little sisters of the poor from being forced to pay for abortions.today is the national day of prayer and the white house is celebrating the occasion with christian leaders by scheduling the order signing today. the order is a promise to respect religious rights and could pave the way for the trump administration dropping the lawsuit the obama administration was fighting against the little sisters and dozens of christian entities not wanting to pay for abortions or abortion-causing drugs.the order indicates the trump administration will  provide regulatory relief for religious objectors to obamacare s burdensome preventive services mandate, a position supported by the supreme court decision in hobby lobby. family research council president tony perkins was at the white house for the signing ceremony of an executive order protecting religious liberty. he told lifenews.com that the new order ensures the freedom of all americans to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs. the executive order makes clear that the administration will pursue policies that  protect and vigorously promote religious liberty. the president s executive order is a clear reflection of his campaign promise to protect the religious freedoms of americans. president trump is taking a significant first step to defending religious liberty. in working with the trump administration, it is clear that they both recognize and understand the dangers of the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and are therefore committed to undoing those policies and restoring true religious freedom,  he said.  the freedom to live out faith in all areas of society without government punishment or intimidation is what has made america great.   life newswatch here: ",1

" protesters clashed with police in western ivory coast s cocoa belt on friday after the death of a youth leader, raising the prospect of more disruptions to the harvest. nearly 7,000 people have fled illegal plantations and 10 have died in the past month because of land disputes between native groups and migrants from other parts of ivory coast and neighboring countries. ethnically charged conflicts over land in ivory coast s fertile west were at the heart of a decade of turmoil that culminated in a brief civil war in 2010 11 that killed more than 3,000 people. members of the we alliance from the guere, yacouba and wobe ethnic groups have in recent weeks entered the cavally and gouin debe reserves and threatened ethnic baoules and migrants from burkina faso farming there, hurting cocoa deliveries. violence flared after well known we youth leader modeste nenonhon was shot dead on thursday in the village of beoua, the red cross and a government spokesman told reuters.  the house of a local prefect was ransacked by protesters in the town of guiglo, where many of the farmers have fled, said government spokesman bruno kone, adding that an inquiry into the violence and the death were underway.      it was not clear who was responsible for the shooting, but thousands of we demonstrators again took to the streets in the towns of blolequin and guiglo on friday. in guiglo, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters.   there is a big march to blolequin and another one also to guiglo,  said franck gaba, an official with the ivorian red cross.  last night, a vehicle was set on fire in the court where baoule displaced people are set up.  baoule and burkinabe farmers in the region were on edge, fearing retaliatory attacks after the youth leader s death.  we are afraid for our safety in the villages here because ... the youth of the alliance will seek revenge,  said felix kouadio, who cultivates seven hectares of cocoa in the gouin debe reserve. the volume of cocoa beans from the area has already dropped in recent weeks as farmers flee. continuing tensions could impact more deliveries just as the cocoa harvest picks up pace this month.  the ivorian parks and reserves office (oipr) estimates that up to 40 percent of ivorian cocoa production comes from illegal plantations like the ones impacted by the violence.

" president donald trump on friday fired his chief strategist steve bannon in the latest white house shake up, removing a far right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti globalization agenda. bannon’s firing, a year and a day after trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble rousing political provocateur’s tumultuous tenure in a white house riven with rivalries and back stabbing during which he clashed with more moderate factions. he was instrumental in some of trump’s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several muslim majority countries, abandoning the paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. he was no friend of the republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president’s hard line conservative supporters. white house officials said trump had told new chief of staff john kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting, and that bannon’s fate was sealed by comments published on  wednesday in the american prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration. trump, seven months into his presidency, has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the virginia college town of charlottesville last saturday and his attacks on fellow republicans. some republicans had even begun questioning trump’s capacity to govern. as trump came under fire from republicans including two former presidents, and from business leaders and u.s. allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for bannon’s ouster. critics had accused bannon of harboring anti semitic and white nationalist sentiments. “white house chief of staff john kelly and steve bannon have mutually agreed today would be steve’s last day,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement. bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right wing breitbart news on friday afternoon, the website said. prior to joining the trump campaign, he had spearheaded breitbart’s shift into a forum for the “alt right,” a loose online confederation of neo nazis, white supremacists and anti semites. bannon said his departure from the white house signals a major shift for the trump agenda. “the trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” bannon told the conservative weekly standard.  “i just think his ability to get anything done   particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, it’s just gonna be that much harder,” bannon said. he said he would use breitbart to attack opponents of the  populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment republicans. “i am definitely going to crush the opposition,” bannon said. he became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a trump white house that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, two communications directors and a chief spokesman. trump’s presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in congress and a special counsel named by the justice department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and russia, something both trump and moscow deny. bannon, 63, is a former u.s. navy officer, goldman sachs investment banker and hollywood movie producer. he had been in a precarious position before but trump opted to keep him, in part because he had played a major role in trump’s november 2016 election victory over democrat hillary clinton and was backed by many of the president’s most loyal rank and file supporters. democrats cheered bannon’s departure. “steve bannon’s firing is welcome news,” said nancy pelosi, the top house of representatives democrat. “the trump administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions.” wall street indexes and the u.s. dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in washington intensified doubts about trump’s ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts. after a late morning boost following reports of bannon’s ouster, the dollar and u.s. equities lost ground. bannon felt a close ideological connection to trump’s populist tendencies and “america first” message. like trump, he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing american military involvement in iraq and afghanistan. the decision to fire bannon could undermine trump’s support among far right voters but might ease tensions within the white house and with party leaders. republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul. trump ran into trouble after saying anti racism demonstrators in charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests, and that there were “very fine people” among both groups. those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies. bannon’s departure removes a large source of friction on the white house staff, but does not herald a significant shift by trump toward the center on major policy issues, three administration officials said. “a good deal of what was attributed to bannon, for example on china trade and restricting immigration, and the border wall, all came before bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him,” said one white house official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. bannon has been a hawk on china, urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit beijing’s help to rein in north korea. in his comments to american prospect, bannon said the united states was in an economic war with china.     a second official said the biggest winners from bannon’s departure are national security adviser h.r. mcmaster; gary cohn, trump’s chief economic adviser; and trump’s daughter ivanka and her husband, jared kushner. bannon’s departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the white house, such as sebastian gorka. some conservative activists expressed disappointment in bannon’s ouster. republicans were largely quiet, though moderate republican congresswoman ileana ros lehtinen said she was glad bannon was out but that the administration “must work to build bridges, not destroy them.” by the time trump had hired bannon as campaign manager, the real estate magnate had already vanquished his republican opponents for the party’s presidential nomination. asked about bannon on tuesday, trump called him “a friend of mine” but downplayed his contribution to his election victory. “mr. bannon came on very late. you know that. i went through 17 senators, governors and i won all the primaries. mr. bannon came on very much later than that. and i like him. he is a good man. he is not a racist,” trump said.

" thousands of kansas residents who signed up to vote at motor vehicle offices but were kept off the rolls by a state law requiring proof of citizenship could be allowed to cast ballots in the november general election, under a ruling on friday by a u.s. appeals court. kansas’ secretary of state, kris kobach, a republican who has become a national leader in pushing for voting changes, had asked the 10th u.s. circuit court of appeals to place on hold a decision last month by a lower court judge ordering the state to begin registering 18,000 residents affected by the law. in requesting the stay, the state said the order to begin to register voters would “result in extraordinary confusion on november 8, 2016.” the denver based federal appeals court, however, rejected the argument. “we conclude that defendant appellant has not made the requisite showing for a stay pending appeal so we deny that motion,” a panel of the appeals court said in its ruling. the appeals court has not yet ruled on the merits of the case. it did not say when it expected it would make a decision, but it granted expedited review. the kansas law will not affect the state’s status as a safe republican stronghold in november’s presidential election, but it has thrust kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions. representatives for kobach could not be reached for comment. the ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by kansas residents who submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. under a state law that took effect in 2013, they were required to present a document such as a birth certificate. the american civil liberties union, which represents the plaintiffs, argued in their lawsuit that the statute conflicts with a federal law designed to make it easier to register to vote while getting a driver’s license.  u.s. district court judge julie robinson, in her may 17 ruling ordering kansas to begin to register more than 18,000 applicants at division of motor vehicle offices who were kept off the rolls, noted that kansas could identify only three non citizens who voted between 2003 and 2013. under robinson’s ruling, kansas residents placed on the rolls can vote in federal but not state elections. kansas will hold its primaries for state and local elections in august.

" energy infrastructure companies in the caribbean and southeastern united states continued to restart as of friday after shutdowns due to hurricane irma. irma was downgraded to a tropical depression on monday and weakened further into a post tropical cyclone by tuesday, the national hurricane center said.  kinder morgan inc said it is making  significant progress  on restarting systems that were temporarily or partially shut down as a precaution during the passage of irma. it said the orlando and tampa products terminals and their associated truck racks, the central florida pipeline (cfpl), elba island lng terminal, the plantation pipe line system, and other terminals in alabama, georgia and south carolina are fully operational. dominican republican refidomsa s haina refinery and its docks returned to normal after irma, a source familiar with the matter told reuters. statoil  said operations at south riding point resumed earlier this week after being shut down during the weekend.  buckeye partners lp did not immediately have an update available on its bahamas crude oil and fuel terminal, previously known as borco. the terminal is buckeye s largest and can store about 26.2 million barrels of oil, fuel oil, gasoline and other products. buckeye s terminals in puerto rico have returned to normal, a spokesman told reuters in an email. port everglades, south florida s main petroleum delivery hub, said it is open with no restrictions. of the 12 petroleum terminals supplying transportation fuels, 10 were up and delivering fuel to retail stations and two that are still working to reopen have water intrusion and related issues, the port said. irma, which had ranked as one of the most powerful atlantic storms on record before striking the u.s. mainland as a category 4 hurricane on sunday, has been blamed for at least 82 deaths, with several hard hit caribbean islands, including puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands, accounting for more than half the fatalities.

" the director of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s asian american and pacific islander outreach efforts is leaving the campaign for a position with the colorado democrats, a campaign official said on saturday. the departure of lisa changadveja comes ahead of democratic nominating contests in states with the highest proportion of asian american voters, like washington later this month and california in june. “she was an instrumental part of helping build our aapi program and those efforts will continue with events over the next few weeks,” campaign spokeswoman xochitl hinojosa said in an email to reuters. “the campaign is expected to announce a new director of aapi outreach very soon.” changadveja had announced her departure to campaign supporters in an email dated march 18, saying she had “tremendous faith in the campaign’s commitment and ability to continue engaging our community as we move through the rest of the primary and prepare for the general election.” “i will be leaving hillary for america as i have recently accepted a new job at the colorado democratic party,” she said in the email, seen by reuters. changadveja did not immediately return requests for comment.     minority communities have been key voting blocs for the clinton campaign, helping her rack up wins over bernie sanders, the u.s. senator from vermont who is her main rival for the democratic nomination to the nov. 8 presidential election.  asian americans and pacific islanders form about 6 percent of the u.s. population, a figure that does not include people of mixed race, according to the u.s. census bureau.  they make up nearly 15 percent of the population of california, which holds its nominating contest in june, and around 9 percent of the state of washington, which holds its democratic caucus on march 26. asian americans have also been among the fastest growing ethnic groups in the united states, on occasion outstripping the growth in the latino population, according to the census.  a study by the university of california, los angeles last year found that the asian american electorate will double to 12 million voters by 2040.  changadveja joined the clinton campaign in september, according to her linkedin page. she previously served as the lgbtq and aapi director for ready for hillary, a super pac that supported a clinton run for the presidency, according to the page.

" ray dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates lp, said he is increasingly concerned about the trump administration’s “populist” policies that could hurt the world economy. the detrimental effects of these policies could be more powerful than the beneficial effects of trump’s pro business policies, dalio and co chief investment officer bob prince said on tuesday. “we are now in a period of time when how this balance tilts will be more important to the economy, markets, and our well beings than normally dominant drivers such as central bank policies,” dalio and prince said in a note. “while there is a lot of potential to improve fiscal policies and make beneficial structural reforms, there is also a significant risk that his populist policies could hurt the world economy (and worse).” in november, dalio said trump’s policies would have a “broadly positive” effect on the u.s. economy and that bond prices likely made a “30 year top.” trump on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other muslim majority countries. bridgewater oversees about $150 billion in client assets.

" representative mike pompeo, president elect donald trump’s surprise choice to head the cia, supports the u.s. government’s sweeping collection of americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with iran. the retired army officer, west point and harvard law school graduate also has defended the cia’s use of interrogation techniques that are widely condemned as torture. the kansas republican has criticized democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state and her handling of the 2012 attacks on u.s. posts in benghazi, libya. a member of the house of representatives intelligence committee, pompeo, 52, was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave from the congressional district centered on his hometown of wichita. members of both parties regard him as intelligent, collegial and capable, with a keen grasp of national security issues. “mike is very bright and hard working, and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers,” said adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee. “while we have had our share of strong differences   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in benghazi   i know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage.”  pompeo “is a serious guy who studies issues carefully,” said former national security agency and cia director michael hayden. some civil liberties and human rights advocates, however, expressed concern over pompeo’s selection because he opposes  closing the guantanamo bay detention center. they also criticized his support for the national security agency’s now defunct bulk communications metadata collection and other surveillance programs. “these positions and others merit serious public scrutiny through a confirmation process,” said anthony romero, the executive director of the american civil liberties union. in a january op ed in the wall street journal he co authored, pompeo called for a “fundamental upgrade to america’s surveillance capabilities,” including resuming bulk collection of domestic phone metadata, the numbers and time stamps of calls, but not their content.  the program, which a federal appeals court and two governmental review panels found to be illegal and ineffective, should be expanded to include “publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database”, and that “legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed,” he wrote. he also called for the death penalty for edward snowden, the nsa contractor who disclosed the existence of the metadata program and other top secret surveillance programs.    pompeo stands a good chance of being confirmed by the republican controlled senate. announcement of his nomination was warmly greeted by senator richard burr, the chairman of the senate intelligence committee, which will conduct his confirmation hearing.  pompeo has been at the forefront of attacks in congress on clinton, accusing her of “criminality” for storing emails containing classified information on her private server. he served on the republican led house committee that investigated the attacks by islamist extremists on u.s. diplomatic and cia posts in benghazi that killed four americans. while the panel found no wrongdoing by the administration, pompeo and another member appended to the final report a commentary accusing clinton and other officials of failing to protect the posts and to respond appropriately to the attacks.     democrats accused pompeo of using inaccurate information to exaggerate alleged failures by clinton on benghazi.some of pompeo’s positions also are at odds with the assessments of the intelligence officers and analysts trump wants him to command. while he has argued that the cia’s use of harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning, produced useful intelligence, current cia director john brennan has said he would resign if he were ordered to resume the practice. other cia and military officers and fbi agents have said so called “enhanced interrogation techniques” do not produce reliable information because prisoners will “say anything” to end their suffering, as one cia official put it. pompeo also is at odds with the intelligence community’s assessment of the 2015 deal that lifted financial sanctions from iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. he has vowed to overturn the deal, and suggested in a 2014 roundtable with journalists that the united states should bomb iran’s nuclear facilities, a proposal that u.s. intelligence experts said would only delay tehran’s development of a warhead, not halt it. pompeo also has opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, while at the cia, a recently created mission center for global issues tracks global warming as a threat to u.s. security. he has taken positions that are at odds with trump’s, notably on russia’s actions in ukraine and its military support for syrian president bashar al assad, who also is supported by iran. russia has established a toehold in the middle east, and “we now have the iranian russian axis there largely running free,” pompeo told a security forum in 2015. pompeo, who was born in california, graduated first in his class from the u.s. military academy at west point and was an artillery officer in the army for five years. he received a degree from the harvard law school and was an editor of the prestigious harvard law review.

"obeying the law can be such a pain in the ass, at least according to the trump organization. with their hundreds of employees, it can just be so difficult to fill out paperwork to make sure that any gifts and money that comes from foreign governments violates the constitution s emoluments clause.in response to a document request from the house oversight committee, trump s company sent a copy of an eight-page pamphlet detailing how it plans to track payments it receives from foreign governments at the firm s many hotels, golf courses, and restaurants across the globe. but while the trump organization said it would set aside all money it collects from customers that identify themselves as representing a foreign government, it would not undertake a more intensive effort to determine if a payment would violate the constitution s prohibition on public office holders accepting an  emolument  from a foreign state. to fully and completely identify all patronage at our properties by customer type is impractical in the service industry and putting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand,  the trump organization wrote in its policy pamphlet, which the company s chief compliance officer said had been distributed to general managers and senior officials at all of its properties.source: the atlanticlet s just add this to trump s ever growing list of broken promises. while it seemed that the wall that will likely never get built was the cornerstone of trump s campaign, his real selling point was the promise that he would be the anti-whatever the right-wing media has been telling us about hillary clinton over the last 20 years. instead, he became everything the right-wing made up about hillary and much, much more.instead of draining the swamp, trump filled it with a bevy of goldman sachs people. he said he would take no salary. he is taking one. and while he did donate his first quarter salary to the national parks service, that s tax deductible for him, so taxpayers are covering the cost of his salary and the tax deduction.trump is a grifter. he might not have run for president with the specific goal of getting richer, but he s certainly taking advantage of all the opportunities the office hands him, legal or not. diplomats are staying at his hotels, just hoping that it will give them a special in with blotus. since taking office, china has granted trump 39 new trademarks. hell, just this week, daughter ivanka took what amounted to a $100 million from the saudi government to go to her theoretical foundation   this after he was saying that hillary clinton should be locked up for taking donations from the saudis for her actual foundation.if trump refuses to abide by the constitution   the one thing he was sworn to on inauguration day, it s time for him to go. then again, it seems that with every move, with every secret he discloses, with every flirtation with the russians, trump is daring us to do something about it.",1

" u.s. president donald trump signed a memorandum on friday that directs the u.s. military not to accept transgender men and women as recruits and halts the use of government funds for sex reassignment surgeries for active personnel unless the process is already underway. the memo, released by the white house, laid out in more detail a ban on transgender individuals serving in the u.s. armed forces that trump announced via twitter last month, reversing a policy shift started under his predecessor, president barack obama. in it, trump directed the department of defense and department of homeland security to stop using government funds for sex reassignment procedures unless it is necessary “to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex,” the memo said. the order requires secretary of defense jim mattis to determine in the coming months how to handle transgender individuals currently serving in the military using criteria including “military effectiveness and lethality,” budget constraints and law. a white house official who briefed reporters about the memo declined to specify whether transgender service men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. the official said trump decided the obama administration had not identified a sufficient basis for changing what was then long standing policy on transgender troops. the memo called on mattis to submit a plan to trump by february 21, 2018, on how to implement the changes. trump’s decision appealed to some in his conservative political base while creating uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. the change drew swift criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) rights. “the president’s order to remove transgender service members from the united states armed forces and deny them healthcare is nothing less than a purge,” matt thorn, executive director of outserve sldn, a group dedicated to lgbt equality in the military, said in a statement. “our military is strongest when all people who are fit to serve have the opportunity to do so. this unprecedented policy amounts to a purge of qualified, contributing troops, and will serve only to undermine unit cohesion and weaken military readiness,” said jennifer levi, an official at the gay rights group glad (glbtq legal advocates & defenders) in a statement. asked how the policy squared with trump’s pledge to stand up for gay rights, the white house official said the president would ensure that such rights were protected but had been critical previously of the transgender changes under the obama administration.

" a federal judge in washington on wednesday ordered that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton may have to testify in a lawsuit related to the private email server she used while secretary of state.  u.s. district judge emmet sullivan said the parties in the case, the state department and conservative watchdog group judicial watch, also struck an agreement about the scope of the testimonies that some of clinton’s former top aides will give in the case. those testimonies, known as discovery, will take place over the next eight weeks and may yield information that would require clinton herself to be deposed, sullivan said in an order.  clinton has come under fire for using a private email account and server at her home in new york state for official emails when she was america’s top diplomat between 2009 and 2013.  critics, including likely republican presidential election rival donald trump, say she endangered government secrets and evaded transparency laws but the former first lady denies any wrongdoing. judicial watch brought a lawsuit against the state department to gain access to records related to a clinton aide’s employment. the federal bureau of investigation is also probing her email arrangement. “this is a very great victory for transparency and, despite the best efforts of the obama administration and the clinton camp, it looks like we might finally get some answers under oath about the clintons’ illicit email system,” said tom fitton, president of judicial watch.        sullivan gave judicial watch permission to take testimony from close clinton aide huma abedin and others. they may be asked about the creation and operation of the private server but nothing unrelated to “whether state conducted an adequate search” in response to judicial watch’s request for the emails, according to the court order.  it is not typical for a judge to grant discovery to a plaintiff in a freedom of information act case, but sullivan said in the order that the question remained whether the state department provided all relevant documents to judicial watch.

" a new york state judge on wednesday ordered exxonmobil corp to work with new york’s attorney general to recover lost emails from an account once used by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson when he was the oil company’s chief executive. justice barry ostrager of the state supreme court in manhattan also ordered exxon by march 31 to turn over documents from its management committee that had been subpoenaed by eric schneiderman, the attorney general. schneiderman had issued the subpoena in november, in connection with his probe into whether exxon misled investors and the public about climate change. at a court hearing on wednesday, a lawyer for the attorney general said exxon had just made a “bombshell” revelation that it had lost a year of emails from an account that tillerson had used, but under the alias “wayne tracker.”     tillerson used the alias account to send and receive information about climate change and other matters, schneiderman said in a march 13 letter to the court. schneiderman said exxon failed to disclose the “wayne tracker” account, and that it had been uncovered during the review of other materials. the letter also said exxon had produced 60 documents bearing the “wayne tracker” email, but had not said the account was tillerson’s. exxon responded that the account was proper, enabling tillerson to communicate easily with other exxon officials, and set up because of the flood of email that tillerson already received. it has also said it does not consider the lost emails significant, and that copies of many would already have been turned over to the attorney general. in december, tillerson left exxon, where he had also been chairman, and stepped down as chairman of the american petroleum institute trade group. the discovery of tillerson’s account came after disclosures that former secretary of state hillary clinton and current vice president mike pence, when he was indiana’s governor, had used previously undisclosed accounts to send and receive mail electronically.

" utility crews from the u.s. mainland were scrambling to puerto rico on thursday after hurricane maria left nearly the entire u.s. territory, and many of its caribbean neighbors, without power, according to officials. the puerto rico electric power authority (prepa) reported almost 100 percent of its 1.5 million customers were without power as of late wednesday, the u.s. department of energy said in an update on the hurricane s impact on thursday, after maria s winds snapped trees and utility polls.  puerto rico governor ricardo rossello told cnn prepa was so severely hit that it could be months before electricity is restored to all those customers. president donald trump said on thursday that hurricane maria  totally obliterated  the u.s. island territory of puerto rico with its electrical grid destroyed. in the u.s. virgin islands, the majority of the 25,000 customers on st. croix were also reported to be without power, the doe report added. energy support crews have been deployed to st. thomas and st. croix in support of federal emergency management agency (fema) teams there, and others are prepared to deploy to puerto rico as soon as conditions permit, the doe said. the american public power association said it was also bringing in utility and contractor crews from parts of the u.s. mainland to help with recovery efforts.  at least one support team is already in puerto rico, said mike hyland, senior vice president, engineering services at the association, in a phone interview.  they ve been in san juan since maria passed and i believe they re going today to st. thomas. ... right now our mission is to get the lights back on,  he said, adding that there were limited flights and barges serving the islands.  the power outages have forced critical facilities, like hospitals, to rely on generators, and raised concerns about potential fuel shortages as some gas stations may not have backup power.  the fuel is there, you just can t pump it,  said patrick dehaan, petroleum analyst at gasbuddy.  maria killed at least 10 people as it raged through the caribbean, the second major hurricane to do so this month. it packed winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph), when it made landfall on puerto rico on wednesday as the strongest storm to hit the u.s. territory in nearly 90 years. maria s devastation comes just as puerto rico, which is facing the largest municipal debt crisis in u.s. history, and prepa, which is bankrupt, were recovering from hurricane irma, which grazed the island, knocking out power to two thirds of the residents. petroleum supplies just under half of the island s electricity, and natural gas supplies nearly one third, according to federal government data.  in recent years, high world petroleum prices have driven typical puerto rican power prices as high as three times those in the u.s. mainland. maria, which could strengthen somewhat over the next day or so, was forecast to move north in the atlantic ocean over the weekend, the nhc said.

" u.s. senators from both parties this week have criticized the trump administration’s decision that government agencies do not have to provide information to democratic lawmakers, saying the step will prevent congress from carrying out its constitutional duties.  during budget and nomination hearings, senators have pressed current and prospective officials about a justice department legal opinion dated may 1. the opinion said information requests to executive agencies from senior democrats on congressional committees, called ranking members, “do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings.” the opinion, largely unprecedented, says agencies are required to give information to only committee chairs, positions held by members of the majority party in congress. currently, republicans control both chambers of congress and the white house. most lawmakers first learned about the guidance in media reports last month. now, they say agencies under president donald trump are becoming less responsive to them, making it harder to check whether the executive branch is correctly carrying out laws, as required by the constitution. some republicans also have questioned allowing agencies to ignore requests from congress. missouri senator claire mccaskill, a democrat who is ranking member of the governmental affairs committee that looks into waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, grew enraged on wednesday when a nominee for the white house’s budget office would not commit to respond, without reservation, to her inquiries.  the nominee for office of management and budget deputy director, russell vought, said that if he is confirmed for the post his responses to her would be “subject to the discretion of the director and advice of legal counsel.” he added that he was “merely reflecting the administration’s policy.” calling the legal guidance “hogwash,” mccaskill cast withholding information from her as the administration’s attempt to hide problems and wrongdoing. “welcome to the big leagues, administration. this is what happens, you get oversight,” she said, adding she has had a “few problems” with receiving information but not to the extent of other democrats. a republican on the committee, ohio’s rob portman, said that when he headed the budget office under former president george w. bush, he found dealing with congress was often frustrating. “but i felt it was my responsibility to provide information,” he said, adding he hoped vought would do so if confirmed for the job.

" the leader of a pakistani militant group whose suicide bombings killed more than 250 people died on thursday of injuries from a u.s. drone strike in afghanistan, a spokesman for the militants said. omar khalid khorasani s death comes ahead of u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson s visit and is likely to help ease tensions between the often wary allies, as islamabad has been asking washington to target militants who attack inside pakistan and hide over the border in afghanistan. khorasani s jamaat ul ahrar (jua), a splinter faction of the pakistani taliban, is one of dozens of armed islamist factions   including al qaeda and the afghan taliban   operating in afghanistan and pakistan. but jua has been particularly deadly in pakistan, claiming responsibility for eight major attacks in two years. among them was last year s easter sunday bombing in a park that killed at least 70 people, including 29 children, in the eastern city of lahore. the group also said it carried out a suicide attack at a hospital that killed at least 74 people in the southwestern city of quetta, a bombing also claimed by islamic state, with which jua also has been affiliated. rumours had flown for two days that khorasani had been wounded in u.s. drone strikes along the afghan pakistani border, and on thursday his group confirmed he had died.  our leader, omar khalid khorasani, was wounded in one of the recent drone strikes in afghanistan. he was wounded badly, and today he was martyred,  jua spokesman asad mansur said by telephone. the announcement came a week after pakistan s army rescued a kidnapped american couple and their three children from the haqqani network, an afghan taliban faction that washington has long accused islamabad of failing to target. the killing of khorasani is likely to add to the recently improved mood between washington and islamabad, said talat masood, a retired pakistani general and prominent political analyst.  he was a very powerful leader and he had done great harm to pakistan,  masood said of khorasani.  i think pakistan has been looking forward to this, and i think the americans targeting him has been very helpful in that sense.  khorasani had a background that reads like a history of pakistani militancy. born abdul wali in a village called lakaro in the northwestern mohmand tribal region, khorasani started out as an anti india jihadist fighting in kashmir, according to a long time friend who spoke last year to reuters on condition of anonymity. he later joined the pakistani taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia islamic law. in 2014, khorasani left the pakistani taliban after a leadership quarrel to form jamaat ul ahrar. jua gained attention in september 2014 when it announced it was supporting islamic state and rejecting the main pakistani taliban leadership. by march 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main pakistani taliban umbrella leadership. still, jua never specifically disavowed islamic state either, and several attacks inside pakistan have been claimed by both groups. the united states last year designated jua as a terrorist group. khorasani had previously been seriously wounded in a nato air strike in eastern afghanistan in 2015 but later recovered.

" hundreds of people marched through los angeles on sunday in a may day rally that took aim at republican presidential front runner donald trump for his anti illegal immigration platform that includes building a wall along the u.s. border with mexico. the demonstration in america’s second most populous city, which has a large immigrant population, came just days after protesters smashed the window of a police car and blocked traffic outside a trump campaign event in costa mesa, california, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of los angeles. on friday, demonstrators blocked the entrance of a hotel hosting the california republican convention in burlingame, south of san francisco, forcing trump to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to deliver his speech. the rally in los angeles remained peaceful and drew smaller crowds than some past may day demonstrations in the city, with several hundred people marching through downtown at one point but largely dispersing by midafternoon.  members of the crowd carried a large blow up effigy of trump holding a ku klux klan hood, along with signs that read: “dump trump.”  “he’s threatened that should he become president of the united states, in his first 18 months in office, he fully intends to deport all 11 million plus undocumented persons in the united states. we don’t take that lightly,” said juan jose gutierrez, of the full rights for immigrants coalition. others waved mexican or u.s. flags or signs that called for immigration reform and an end to deportations. a los angeles police department spokeswoman said no arrests were made and there were no reports of violence.  protests have become common outside rallies for trump, 69, the new york billionaire businessman. he has aroused criticism for his pledge to deport illegal immigrants, even as it helped propel him in the race for the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. he has accused mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists to the united states and has promised to build a wall along the southern border and make mexico pay for it. trump said on sunday he will have essentially sealed the republican nomination if he wins tuesday’s contest in indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival ted cruz, a u.s. senator from texas. california holds its presidential primary on june 7.

" u.s. president elect donald trump must divest his luxury washington hotel in a building leased from the federal government because the arrangement violates conflict of interest rules, congressional democrats said on wednesday. the general services administration, which manages property owned by the federal government, including the old post office  housing the trump international hotel, has said the lease would violate federal conflict of interest rules once the republican businessman is sworn in on jan. 20, according to a letter to the agency from lawmakers. the letter referred to a dec. 8 briefing to congressional staffers by a gsa official whom the letter did not name. “the deputy commissioner made clear that mr. trump must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well,” representative elijah cummings of maryland and three other democrats said in the letter, which was made public on wednesday. the hotel is a few blocks from the white house and has become a rallying point for anti trump protesters since it opened in september. it is among businesses that could create unprecedented conflicts of interest for trump, a new york real estate developer and former reality tv star. trump’s company has not responded to the gsa’s concerns about the potential conflict, the democratic lawmakers said. they asked the agency for documents about the lease, profit and expense projections and legal memos about the conflict of interest. the hotel lease includes a standard gsa provision barring members of congress or other elected federal officials   such as the president   from having any part of it.  trump has said he will draw up documents that will remove him from day to day business operations. he had planned a thursday news conference to disclose details, but put that announcement off until next month. trump will address the hotel issue in january, spokesman jason miller told reporters. in response to the democrats’ letter, the gsa said in a statement it could not speak definitively about divestment until trump’s financial arrangements were completed and he had become president. the agency added, “to do so now would be premature.” later on wednesday, cummings said democrats still stood “100 percent behind” the letter, saying gsa informed their staff of the lease issue. federal law does not prohibit the president’s involvement in private business while in office, even though lawmakers and executive branch officials are subject to conflict of interest rules.  but most presidents in recent decades have placed their personal assets in blind trusts so they do not know how their decisions influence their personal fortunes. trump has said he plans to avoid the conflict issue by transferring control of his businesses to his oldest three children.  but the u.s. office of government ethics said in a letter to democratic senator tom carper of delaware on monday that such a transfer would not qualify legally as a blind trust nor eliminate conflicts of interest.

" france said on wednesday that lebanese prime minister saad al hariri, who lebanon s president says is being held hostage by saudi arabia, will visit france with his family in coming days.  hariri travelled to riyadh on nov. 3 before abruptly resigning in a televised statement a day later. he has stayed in riyadh and top lebanese officials and senior politicians close to hariri have told reuters he was forced to quit.  hariri and saudi arabia have both denied he is being held in riyadh or was coerced to resign. hariri has said he will return to lebanon in the next few days to formally submit his resignation.    the crisis has thrust lebanon onto the frontline of a middle east contest for power pitting a saudi led bloc against iran and its allies, including the lebanese shi ite group hezbollah.      french president emmanuel macron said in a statement that he had invited hariri to france after speaking to him and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman.  the invitation is to visit for a few days and is not an offer of political exile, macron said, speaking in germany.   we will not accept (hariri) remaining a hostage whose reason for detention we do not know,  lebanese president michel aoun said in a statement.  foreign minister gebran bassil, the head of aoun s political party, said the situation was  not normal  but that beirut wanted  good relations  with riyadh. aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to lebanon to formally tender it and explain his reasons, which hariri has said he will do in the coming days.     saudi arabia has long been considered hariri s main external supporter. aoun is a political ally of lebanon s hezbollah, a powerful shi ite muslim group with close ties to iran.  lebanon s coalition government was formed last year through a political deal that made aoun president, hariri prime minister, and included members of hezbollah in the cabinet.  saudi arabia last week accused lebanon of having declared war on it because of hezbollah s role in other arab countries. it regards hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.  riyadh s main ally, the united states, has struck a different tone, continuing its support for lebanon including military aid. the european union has also repeatedly stated its support for lebanon, which hosts 1.5 million syrian refugees.  in an interview on sunday night with a television station he owns, hariri warned of economic sanctions against lebanon and of a threat to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of lebanese workers living in saudi arabia and its gulf allies.   nothing justifies hariri s lack of return for 12 days. we therefore consider him detained,  aoun said. he added that lebanon had confirmed that hariri s family were under detention in their house in saudi arabia and were searched whenever they entered or left it.  speaking in italy, foreign minister bassil said:  we will continue all steps...for this problem to be solved in a brotherly way through good relations that we want to have with the kingdom of saudi arabia.   he added, however:  if saudi arabia has a problem with iran or with hezbollah, they have to solve it with iran, not with lebanon and not with all the lebanese.   hariri wrote on twitter that he was  perfectly fine  and would return,  god willing, to dear lebanon as i promised . on wednesday he said he would return in a couple of days but that his family was staying in saudi arabia, calling it  their country . hariri holds saudi nationality and his family fortune is based on the construction company   saudi oger   built by his father rafik al hariri, who served twice as lebanese prime minister and was assassinated in 2005.       okab sakr, a member of parliament for hariri s future movement, told reuters he had spoken on wednesday to hariri and that he told him neither he nor his family were being held.  on tuesday, european union foreign policy chief federica mogherini said after meeting bassil in paris that she expected hariri and his family to return to lebanon soon.  sources from across lebanon s political spectrum have said hariri struck a more compromising tone in his sunday interview than in his resignation statement, when he bitterly attacked iran and hezbollah.  the sources said this represented a retreat by riyadh attributable to western pressure. on wednesday, aoun said riyadh had not responded to arab countries who tried to secure hariri s return so he had asked the international community to help.  french foreign minister jean yves le drian arrives in riyadh late on wednesday and is due to discuss lebanon with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and meet hariri on thursday, a french diplomatic source said. france has close relations with lebanon, which was under french control between the world wars, and with hariri, who has a home in france and spent several years in the country.

" the european union has called very publicly for malta to bring to justice the killers of a journalist who accused the mediterranean island s leaders of profiting from global corruption. but it has for years been much less vocal   and had little success   in ensuring malta act to prevent money laundering, according to sources familiar with the work of the maltese authorities and a reuters review of eu and maltese data. the data show the smallest eu state has been slow to apply international guidelines on naming firms that do not take action against dubious practices, and the number of convictions and sanctions for money laundering has been low. malta has also consistently registered fewer reports of  suspect transactions  from banks, casinos and other financial operators than any other eu state, according to the data, despite having a  disproportionately large financial sector.  the european parliament urged the european commission, the eu s executive, on wednesday to investigate malta s adherence to the rule of law and voiced  serious concerns  about police independence and international money laundering on the island. [l8n1nl4li] but criticism of malta on money laundering   in low key reports by international supervisory bodies and by anti corruption campaigner daphne caruana galizia, killed by a car bomb on oct. 16   appears so far to have had little impact.  malta has sold its sovereignty to dirty money. the european commission should take a more active role in investigating the condition of rule of law in malta,  sven giegold, a member of  european parliament from germany s greens party who campaigns against financial crime, told reuters.  he said an international investigator was needed to counter a  culture of impunity and fiddling between political and economic elites  in malta. prime minister joseph muscat told reuters last month malta s  financial services sector was  as transparent, solid and compliant as any other european jurisdiction . european commission vice president frans timmermans told lawmakers on tuesday the eu executive had  no general concerns  about malta s compliance with anti money laundering laws though   improvements could be made on various levels.  despite having a population of only 420,000, malta, a former british naval stronghold south of sicily, has a financial sector that dwarfs many eu countries. it is also the european leader in online gaming.  in 2016, assets of banks and financial institutions in malta were more than 20 times its gross domestic product, about five times the equivalent figure for germany and nearly four times the euro zone average, european central bank figures show. yet in a report on the eu s anti money laundering efforts that was released without fanfare in september, europol said malta reported fewer suspect transactions than other eu states between 2008, when it adopted the euro, and 2014. europol also raised concerns that malta and cyprus may be failing to report as many cases as they should.  the supervisory authorities  receive very few reports given the size of their banking sectors and the significance of these jurisdictions in offshore financial services,  europol said. malta s financial intelligence analysis unit (fiau), the country s anti money laundering agency, received 202 reports of suspect transactions in 2014, the last year for which europol data are available. lithuania recorded the next fewest   over 50 percent more than malta in a financial sector one sixth the size. by contrast, the netherlands, a much bigger economy, reported 277,532 dubious movements in 2014, the highest number in the euro zone. fiau s deputy director, alfred zammit, told reuters it was impossible to conduct a  meaningful comparison  among eu countries based on available statistics because of different structures and reporting regimes in member states.  it is indeed arguable that given the size of the financial sector in malta, one would expect to see more suspicious transaction reports submitted to the fiau,  zammit said. but he said malta was tackling the problem by increasing awareness of the obligation to report by organizing training sessions. the annual number of reports in malta more than doubled  from 2014 to 2017 although the proportion of those that were passed to the police fell to 11 percent last year from 24 percent in 2013, fiau data show.  the maltese police and the fiau did not respond to questions from reuters on how many of these cases were investigated or led to successful prosecutions. malta s court handed down four money laundering criminal convictions last year but disclosed none in the financial sector.  the results of a european parliament inquiry released this month said the number of convictions was  extremely low  and the institutions implementing and enforcing rules on money laundering were  highly politicized . banks not complying with money laundering rules have received small fines which in few cases were made public, contrary to guidelines recommending exposure to deter wrongdoing.  zammit said the public disclosure of a higher number of sanctioned institutions would have been  disproportionate when compared to the nature of the breach .  moneyval, the anti money laundering watchdog of the council of europe, europe s leading human rights organization, has also raised concerns. it said in a 2012 report that malta s reporting of suspicious transactions was low for the size of its market. in a subsequent report in 2015, moneyval found the country  largely compliant . a moneyval spokesman told reuters the latest report was however not based on a full assessment of the maltese legal framework. the european parliament urged maltese authorities on wednesday to look into allegations of money laundering against pilatus bank, which has its headquarters on the island.  maltese police and pilatus bank did not reply to questions from reuters about allegations against the bank.  for graphic click tmsnrt.rs/2akvblj ",0

" the brazilian government is studying whether to extradite cesare battisti, an italian former left wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, justice minister torquato jardim said on friday. battisti is under arrest in the brazilian frontier town of corumb  where he was detained on wednesday as he tried to cross into bolivia in a taxi, apparently fearing that brazil s government would revoke his asylum status at italy s request. late on friday, battisti s lawyers said he had been granted habeas corpus, a court injunction ordering his release, and that they were trying to get him freed as soon as possible.   battisti faces life in prison in italy, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerilla group called armed proletarians for communism. he escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in france before fleeing to brazil to avoid being extradited to italy. brazil s supreme court authorized battisti s extradition in 2009, but he was not sent back to italy because former leftist president luis inacio lula da silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010.  lula s refusal to extradite battisti upset relations between the two countries. but that is likely to change with michel temer, the center right president who took office last year when lula s handpicked successor, dilma rousseff, was impeached.  no decision has been taken yet. the matter is being studied because the italian government has repeatedly asked that he be sent back to italy,  justice minister jardim told reporters during a conference at the rio de janeiro bar association. brazilian police said battisti was being held for breaking currency laws due to the  significant  amount of cash in euros and dollars that he had at the border crossing. if brazil decides to send battisti back to italy, there is no need for a new extradition request by rome because the earlier one approved by the supreme court is still standing, brazilian officials said.

" while he has swallowed a big budget cut and had the white house veto his chosen deputy, secretary of state rex tillerson is avoiding a public conflict with u.s. president donald trump over his department’s budget, six current and former u.s. officials said on thursday. instead, tillerson privately resisted a 37 percent budget cut that some white house officials sought and he convinced trump he needed more time to identify where savings could be made, two current and one former official told reuters. as a result, the white house proposed on thursday a reduction of some 28 percent on u.s. diplomacy and foreign aid. “tillerson isn’t opposed to cutting the budget at all, but he figured out that he couldn’t win head to head battles with the president and the people close to him, so he’s pursuing a different strategy, arguing that he can’t make wise decisions about what to cut until he’s more familiar with his department and its budget,” said one of the current officials, a state department veteran. tillerson said in tokyo on thursday that his department’s current spending is “simply not sustainable,” and that he accepted the “challenge” trump had given him. “he is making a very sensible calculation,” said a former u.s. official, noting that congress, not the president, holds the purse strings and is almost certain to reject many of the administration’s proposed cuts. “you state your loyalty to the president, and then you know that you will not actually have to live with the president’s budget.” it is not yet clear, however whether trump and tillerson have significant policy differences or if he can defend his department against some of trump’s closest aides such as steve bannon who want to dismantle parts of the federal government and limit u.s. engagement with the world, said three of the current and former officials.  the former exxon mobil corp (xom.n) ceo has faced multiple challenges in his first weeks as chief u.s. diplomat, including unpredictable policy pronouncements from trump.  white house officials vetoed elliot abrams, tillerson’s choice for deputy secretary, the department’s second highest post, one of the current officials said. with that job still vacant, it has not been possible to fill the department’s other senior positions. despite that defeat, michael anton, a national security council spokesman, said the white house holds tillerson in high regard. “president trump has the utmost confidence in the secretary of state and looks forward to mr. tillerson implementing a bold agenda to revitalize american foreign policy,” anton said. a white house official said tillerson has had good access to the president, including multiple lunches, dinners and meetings. tillerson dined with trump on monday, the night before he flew to asia. tillerson has kept a low profile since joining the administration seven weeks ago, spending little time with key state department officials and only holding his first news conference on thursday in tokyo. he has drawn criticism from many state department officials who believe he has failed to cultivate potential allies in trump’s cabinet and on capitol hill.   chas freeman, a seasoned diplomat since the nixon administration, said tillerson’s low key style might be a survival tactic. “if he says something, he runs a big risk of getting crosswise with trump,” freeman said. “this may be a fabian strategy,” referring to the roman statesman fabius who defeated the carthaginian general hannibal by avoiding frontal conflict.

" the national campaign wing for u.s. senate republicans cut fund raising ties on friday with roy moore, the party’s nominee for a special senate race in alabama, a day after sexual misconduct allegations upended his front runner bid for the seat. the move was the latest sign the republican establishment, holding onto a slim 52 48 majority in the senate, was abandoning an insurgent candidacy heavily promoted by u.s. president donald trump’s former political strategist, steve bannon. meanwhile, democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by  democratic election victories in virginia and new jersey on tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the democratic nominee, former u.s. attorney doug jones. moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32 year old prosecutor, the washington post reported on thursday. three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact. the 70 year old moore again denied any wrongdoing on friday during an appearance on conservative commentator sean hannity’s national radio show. “these allegations are completely false and misleading,” moore said. the national republican senatorial committee, which helps elect republicans to the senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on friday severing its fund raising relationship with moore for the special election on dec. 12. numerous prominent republicans have either called on moore to drop out immediately, as arizona senator john mccain did on thursday, or said he should do so if the allegations prove true, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. “moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former republican presidential nominee mitt romney said friday on twitter. senator mike lee of utah, who initially took the same stance as mcconnell, tweeted on friday that could “no longer endorse” moore’s candidacy, after reading “the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from judge moore and his campaign.” senator steve daines of montana likewise said he was pulling his endorsement. but several alabama republican officials did not waver in their support of moore, who scored a decisive primary victory in september over luther strange, the incumbent appointed to fill the seat on an interim basis when jeff sessions was named u.s. attorney general.  the race had been seen as a long shot for democrats in alabama, which has not elected a democratic senator in a quarter century. jones was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls. following publication of the washington post story, several democratic senators, including liberal elizabeth warren of massachusetts, sent email blasts to donors, soliciting more support for jones’ campaign. the democratic party has been coordinating with jones behind the scenes, wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply republican state. progressive groups moveon, democracy for america and indivisible expect the allegations against moore to boost their grassroots efforts to engage democratic voters in alabama. “we were planning to go bigger already,” said matt blizek, a mobilization coordinator for moveon. “with the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.” a win for jones could transform the political picture in washington, narrowing the republican majority down to just one vote. moore has come back from controversy before. he was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a ten commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the u.s. supreme court decision legalizing same sex marriage. democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about muslims and homosexuality. zac mccrary, a veteran democratic pollster based in birmingham, alabama, said he now sees jones as the favorite. “roy moore had much less margin for error than a republican does traditionally in alabama,” mccrary said.  but jonathan gray, a republican consultant in alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the washington post story, given its timing. the only development that could sink moore’s candidacy is a write in campaign from a republican backed by the party, he said. absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “roy moore wins december 12.” ",0
" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on thursday he was unaware that u.s. attorney general jeff sessions had met russian ambassador sergey kislyak, but said such meetings were routine. peskov was speaking after the washington post reported that sessions had failed to disclose two meetings with kislyak. “i don’t know the details of any meetings,” said peskov. “(but) the ambassador’s job is to hold as many meetings as possible.” peskov said talk of possible russian involvement in the u.s. presidential campaign, something moscow categorically denies, was an internal matter for the united states. but he said it served to create an atmosphere in which the idea of repairing u.s. russia ties was harder to sell.

" u.s. civil rights activist deray mckesson, who was instrumental in the growth of the black lives matter movement against police violence, is running for mayor of baltimore. mckesson, who filed his paperwork minutes before wednesday’s deadline, is among more than a dozen democrats heading to an april primary.  the 30 year old son of two now recovered drug addicts, mckesson rose to prominence during the 2014 protests in ferguson, missouri, over the police killing of unarmed black teen michael brown and has become one of the nation’s best known civil rights leaders. his distinctive blue patagonia vest has been seen everywhere from street demonstrations in his native baltimore to a recent appearance on “the late show with stephen colbert.” “i am not the silver bullet for the challenges of our city    no one individual is,” mckesson said on wednesday in a post on the blog publishing platform medium.  “together, with the right ideas, the right passion, the right people, we can take this city in a new direction.” his rivals include former baltimore mayor sheila dixon and state senator catherine pugh. the city has not elected a republican mayor in more than 50 years. current mayor stephanie rawlings blake said in september that she would not seek re election when her term ends. a website set up to collect contributions for mckesson’s campaign had recorded 474 donations totaling $34,383 by midday thursday. an alumnus of maine’s bowdoin college, mckesson worked in baltimore and minneapolis schools before moving into full time activism.  one political observer said working class baltimore voters might hold his lack of political experience against him. “the profile he has now, he’s gotten from doing national work, not local work,” said lester spence, associate professor of political science and african studies at johns hopkins university. last year, the mainly black city of 600,000 people was torn by its worst riots in a half century following the death of freddie gray from injuries sustained while in police custody.    coming amid a string of controversial police killings across the united states, gray’s death proved a turning point when prosecutors brought charges against six officers within weeks. the first of those six trials, in which officer william porter faced charges including involuntary manslaughter, ended in a hung jury.  that threw state’s attorney marilyn mosby’s aggressive schedule into disarray, and a judge last month rejected prosecutors’ request to order porter to testify against his fellow officers while he awaits retrial.

" the u.s. house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on moscow, triggering an angry reaction from russian officials, but analysts are playing down the impact. the sanctions, which have yet to be approved by the u.s. senate and president donald trump, expand and tweak a list of existing sanctions, but cannot be viewed as a game changer, analysts said. russian president vladimir putin will decide if and how moscow will retaliate once the fresh sanctions become law. below are highlights from the bill and analysts’ reactions:   the united states “should continue to uphold and seek unity with european and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the russian federation, which have been effective and instrumental in countering russian aggression in ukraine”. “the secretary of the treasury shall submit ... a report describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products.” the secretary of the treasury shall review sanctions from 2014 “to ensure that the directive prohibits the conduct by united states persons or persons within the united states of all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to the directive, their property, or their interests in property”. “the secretary of the treasury may determine that a person meets one or more of the criteria ... if that person is a state owned entity operating in the railway, or metals and mining sector of the economy of the russian federation.” the secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state, shall submit a detailed report on russia’s senior foreign political figures and oligarchs. the bill is designed “to continue to oppose the nordstream 2 pipeline given its detrimental impacts on the european union’s energy security, gas market development in central and eastern europe, and energy reforms in ukraine”. trump, in coordination with allies of the united states, may impose sanctions on an entity that makes an investment described in the act or “sells, leases, or provides to the russian federation, for the construction of russian energy export pipelines, goods, services, technology, information, or support ... any of which has a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more; or that, during a 12 month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5,000,000 or more.” “with the senate voting 92 2 and the house 419 3, it is highly unlikely that president trump would veto the bill,” said charles robertson, global chief economist at renaissance capital in london. “long term this is really bad news. we know from jackson vaneck that these kind of sanctions are hard to remove once in place. this will further stall foreign investment into russia, negatively impacting growth and development, furthering long term capital flight and brain drain. it will further the isolation from the west, and stagnation of the russian economy,” said tim ash, a senior strategist at bluebay asset management in london. “most importantly for russia, the original senate bill with regard to nord stream 2 was watered down as it now requires coordination with ‘allies’ when imposing such sanctions. moreover, the bill only gives the option for the president to introduce such sanctions, but does not require that he does so. so, overall, i expect marginal negative effect,” ivan tchakarov, senior economist at citi in moscow. “in general we think that the impact on the russian economy should be relatively limited. compared to 2014 when the first set of sanctions was introduced the russian economy is in much better state to weather the measures,” said liza ermolenko, emerging european economist at barclays in london. “in the u.s. sanctions bill we have not seen any direct negative implications for the rouble so far. some tightening of the trade financing terms would not have a material negative impact on the rouble, although it may lead to a shortage of the dollar liquidity in the market and it’s not clear how well companies and banks were prepared to this,” said alexey pogorelov, chief economist at credit suisse in london.

" the sudden and shocking death of supreme court justice antonin scalia opened a new and incendiary front in the already red hot 2016 presidential race, one that promises to divide democrats and republicans and, perhaps, republicans from themselves.  the vacancy on the court, which is now evenly split 4 4 between its conservative and liberal wings, had republicans calling on president barack obama to refrain from choosing a successor to the right leaning scalia while democrats urged obama to do as the u.s. constitution requires and put forward a candidate to face confirmation in an albeit hostile senate. the prospect of such a battle drew swift and furious comment from candidates vying to be elected president in november. facing off in a debate only hours after the 79 year old scalia’s death was announced, some republican presidential candidates seized the moment to caution voters that their party’s front runner, billionaire businessman donald trump, could not be trusted to nominate a stalwart conservative.  “if donald trump is president, he will appoint liberals,” charged u.s. senator ted cruz of texas during the debate in south carolina, which holds a republican nominating contest  next saturday. “two branches of government hang in the balance, not just the presidency, but the supreme court,” cruz said. “if we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidate, the second amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty, every one of those hangs in the balance.” senator lindsey graham of south carolina also took a shot at trump. “donald trump is not a conservative, so i don’t trust him to pick a judge,” graham said before the debate. a real estate mogul, trump has supported democratic politicians in the past. trump, who also has taken several positions at odds with republican orthodoxy, joined other candidates at the debate in insisting that senator mitch mcconnell, republican majority leader in the senate, stand by his promise to block any obama high court choice.  “it’s up to mitch mcconnell and everyone else to stop it,” trump, a former reality tv show host, said. “it’s called delay, delay, delay.” under the u.s. system, the president nominates justices for the nine member court and the senate confirms them. the last justice to be approved by the senate of the opposite party during an election year was justice anthony kennedy in 1988.  obama has already indicated that he intends to send a choice to the senate in coming weeks, meaning that the nominee will be heavily scrutinized by presidential candidates in both parties   and more than likely be opposed by the majority of republicans.  “the court may genuinely be a major issue this year,” said david axelrod, a former top political adviser to obama. “it will be a hell of a fight.” criticism of the court, which in recent years has upheld obama’s sweeping healthcare plan and legalized same sex marriage, has already been a thread running through several republican candidates’ campaigns.  the conservative majority on the court had appeared poised to invalidate obama’s immigration and climate change policies. the loss of scalia, considered to be a lodestar of conservative legal thought, and the potential swing of the court to the left, ensures that whatever drama plays out in the senate this year will be mirrored on the campaign trail. “there is no more clarifying debate in politics these days than when it comes to supreme court nominees,” said jim manley, a democratic strategist and former aide to senator harry reid of nevada. “this now is for all the marbles.” reid was majority leader of the senate when it confirmed previous obama court nominees sonia sotomayor and elena kagan. manley called mcconnell’s threat not to allow a vote on a potential scalia replacement “completely beyond the pale.” democratic candidate hillary clinton seemed inclined to make mcconnell’s threat a campaign issue.  “the republicans in the senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for justice scalia’s seat to remain vacant dishonor our constitution,” clinton said in a statement.  axelrod said that the issue could help clinton, locked in a tight race with u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont.  “i think it will make electability and experience in this realm more important,” he said.   rick hasen, a law professor at the university of california, irvine, and a longtime observer of the supreme court nomination process, said obama likely has two options. “he could nominate a more liberal candidate who would have no real chance of getting through a republican senate   in which case this would become a salient political issue in 2016,” hasen said. or he could nominate a more moderate candidate who might gain enough republican support to gain approval, he said.  there are risks to both approaches: a republican obstruction of a liberal nominee would animate the democratic party’s progressive base in an election year but would leave the court without a potentially tie breaking vote for perhaps a year. that same democratic base might view a moderate nominee as a betrayal, while conservative republican voters likely would frown on any senator who voted to approve an obama choice.  manley said that mcconnell has already shown that he is unwilling to support any choice made by obama and that the white house must act aggressively. “the president should go forward and nominate the most liberal candidate possible,” he said.  given the need to fire up its most passionate voters, that might just be exactly what republican candidates want as well.

" russian president vladimir putin, who is running for re election in march, has proposed writing off some of the tax debts accumulated by russian individuals and small businesses. a total of about 80 billion roubles ($1.4 billion) would be written off under putin s proposal, a high ranking official told reuters. speaking at his annual news conference, putin said that some of the debt accumulated because of flaws in russia s tax system.  i think that people should be freed from these payments, and it should be done in the most de bureaucratic way, without the need to apply to a tax inspection,  he added. he estimated that debts of 42 million people worth 41 billion roubles should be written off. the high ranking official told reuters that putin was speaking about debts for property tax and penalties accrued before 2015 that the tax service recognizes as uncollectible. the debts of 2.9 million self employed entrepreneurs worth more than 15 billion roubles should also be written off, putin said. he also proposed writing off profit tax, accumulated by some russian citizens on their so called waived debts. according to the high ranking official, the latter would mean writing off 22 billion roubles.

" a leading member of greece s most deadly guerrilla group, november 17, began a two day leave from prison on thursday under a parole board ruling that triggered a storm of protest and expressions of regret from britain and the united states. dimitris koufodinas is serving several life terms for his role in the marxist group that operated for almost three decades until greek authorities arrested its leaders in 2002.  its targets ranged from businessmen to diplomats. its first victim was a cia station chief in 1975, and its last a british embassy defense attache in 2000. prison authorities granted his request for temporary leave from jail on condition he report to a police station twice a day. it is his first such leave since he was jailed in 2003 and authorities said it was in compliance with regulations applying to all inmates. but the release comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is frequently accused by opposition parties of being soft on anti establishment groups with roots in leftist radicalism and anarchy. conservative lawmaker dora bakoyannis, whose husband pavlos bakoyannis was gunned down by november 17 in 1989, was visibly angry during a live broadcast after his release from jail.  he isn t just any terrorist. he was a leader, the ideological guide, the guy who wrote a book who said that after the murder (of bakoyannis) he went to a tavern and celebrated. while my children were crying,  she told skai tv. geoffrey pyatt, the u.s. ambassador to greece, said in a tweet the decision was a  dishonor  to the memory of victims and their families. british ambassador smith said she was  deeply disappointed  and shared the victims  pain. both envoys carried photos of plaques at their respective embassies commemorating november 17 victims.  members of november 17 eluded capture for years. the country has a history of political violence and still has urban guerrilla groups, though none as deadly as november 17.  koufodinas, an amateur beekeeper known as  poison hand  for the precision of his aim, has been kept at a high security jail in athens for 15 years. there, he wrote two books, one called  i was born november 17 , and the second  13 answers . in a high profile trial in 2003, 15 people, including koufodinas, were found guilty over the 23 killings and dozens of bomb attacks claimed by the guerrilla group.  a government official said authorities followed procedure.  i am not going to defend the practice, the deeds, nor the ideology of mr koufodinas,  he told real fm radio.  what i can say as a comment is that in this specific case the law was applied to the letter, and the preconditions were met for granting leave.  the group took its name from the date of a 1973 student uprising against the military dictatorship. it is normally marked every nov. 17 with street protests in athens.

" massachusetts will plug any holes in the budget of the state chapter of planned parenthood if the u.s. congress moves to block the use of medicaid funds for treatment at the women’s health care organization, governor charlie baker said on friday. the move by the republican governor of a democratic leaning state is intended in part to signal the gap between his positions and those of the republican controlled congress, many of whose members oppose planned parenthood because the organization provides abortions. u.s. laws already prohibit federal money from being used for abortion, but currently allow the medicaid low income health program to cover other services, such as screening and treatment for cancers and sexually transmitted diseases. “governor baker is a strong supporter of women’s health and believes the commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure access to the important health care services offered by planned parenthood in all corners of our state,” baker spokeswoman lizzy guyton said in a statement. “the administration is prepared to fund these services should the federal government pursue changes that would block care for women and families here in massachusetts.” currently about $2 million of the group’s $21.5 million budget in the state comes from reimbursements for services to medicaid patients. those funds cover treatments for some 10,000 patients a year, about a third of its total, the group said. “at a time when extreme politicians in congress want to block millions of people from accessing essential preventive care at planned parenthood health centers, it is reassuring to see governor baker put the health and wellbeing of our communities ahead of politics,” said dr. jennifer childs roshak, chief executive of the planned parenthood league of massachusetts. as the governor of a liberal leaning state that was the first in the nation to legalize gay marriage more than a decade ago, many of baker’s positions on social issues are to the left of national republicans. he last year signed a law protecting the rights of transgender people and also supports abortion rights. the willingness to step in to fill a budget gap is a pronounced move for a former healthcare executive who has made reining in the state’s budget a key goal of his administration.

" at first glance, u.s. president donald trump and federal reserve chair janet yellen may have little in common.  yellen is an academic economist and veteran of democratic administrations who is committed to an open global economy, while trump is a real estate mogul with an electoral base suspicious of the economic order yellen helped to create. yet the two may have interests in common now that trump is president and both want to get as many americans working as possible.  since her appointment as fed chair in february 2014, yellen has kept interest rates low and she currently pledges to raise them only slowly even though unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is at its lowest in nearly ten years.  meanwhile, trump’s election campaign promises to cut taxes, spend money on infrastructure and deregulate banking, have  helped propel a surge in the u.s. conference board’s consumer confidence index to its highest level since the internet stocks crash 16 years ago. former fed staff and colleagues who know yellen said trump’s surprising remarks this week in a wall street journal interview, in which he did not rule out yellen’s reappointment to a new four year term next year, are not as outlandish as they may appear now that the president has a vested interest in keeping markets and the economy on an even keel.  and the same staff and colleagues say yellen may well accept reappointment, despite trump’s criticism of her during last year’s election campaign.  many in trump’s republican party have called for tighter monetary policy and a less activist fed, but “the president would not really find that useful,” said former fed vice chair donald kohn.  if trump fills three existing federal reserve board vacancies with people yellen thinks she could work with, “it would be really difficult to turn down” a reappointment when her term as chair expires in february 2018. “if she continues to do well, he’d be nuts to ditch her for an unknown quantity,” said university of california, berkeley, economics professor andrew rose, a long time colleague and co author with yellen of an oft cited study of labor markets. yellen took over from ben bernanke as fed chair in february 2014 with the u.s. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground, and she has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in u.s. household wealth.  in a slow return to more normal monetary policy, yellen has stopped the purchase of additional financial securities by the fed and in december 2015 began raising short term interest rates for the first time in 10 years. so far those policy shifts have been engineered with little apparent impact on job growth, and so mesh with trump’s core election campaign promises to restore employment and earnings. the slow rise in interest rates in the past year has also happened while u.s. stock prices have risen to record highs, though trump has claimed the credit for himself.   there is precedent for trump to stick with a former president’s fed chair appointment. paul volcker, alan greenspan and ben bernanke, the three previous fed chairs, served at least two four year terms and were nominated by both democratic and republican presidents.  however it may be a more difficult step for trump.   during last year’s election campaign, trump accused yellen of accepting orders from then president obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as fed chair because she is not a republican party member.  in a particularly biting moment last year, in a campaign video advertisement, he labeled her as among the “global special interests” who had ruined life for middle america.  the fed on thursday said it had no response to trump’s comments published on wednesday on yellen and or on whether yellen would consider a second term.  some of trump’s advisers and some republican lawmakers want a more conservative fed in which the chair has less power and would see a yellen reappointment as yet another step away from his promise to “drain the swamp” of the washington establishment. there are also three current vacancies on the fed’s seven member board of governors, and unorthodox new members could make it difficult for yellen to manage policy or accept another four year term. but if the choice is her consensus style or someone unproven in their ability to manage public and market expectations, “he’d be wise to reappoint her,” said joseph gagnon, a former fed staffer and berkeley colleague of yellen’s currently at the peterson institute for international economics. “i don’t see what is in his interests to appoint someone who is going to jack up interest rates.” ",0

" on the eve of his trip to europe, rex tillerson gave a speech last week that european allies had waited months to hear: an  ironclad  promise of u.s. support to its oldest allies. the relief in european capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a white house plan to oust the u.s. secretary of state, plunging america s friends back into confusion over president donald trump s foreign policy. the uncertainty is particularly acute given washington s leading role in crises in north korea and syria.  just as tillerson comes to brussels to give a public statement of support that the eu and nato have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,  said an eu official involved in diplomacy with white house officials.  it leaves europe just as doubtful as before about trump.  u.s. officials said on thursday the white house had a plan for cia director mike pompeo to replace tillerson but trump said on friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on saturday the reports were untrue. european leaders yearn for stability in u.s. foreign policy. they are troubled by trump s  america first  rhetoric and inconsistent statements on nato and the european union. in addition, trump s decision to pull out of the paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify iran s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine european priorities.  the chaos in the administration doesn t help in the current geopolitical climate,  said a senior french diplomat. early last week, tillerson, a former exxon mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of europe in washington more akin to traditional u.s. policy.  the united states remains committed to our enduring relationship with europe. our security commitments to european allies are ironclad,  he told a think tank.  he said he would convey that message to the european union and nato. he is set to visit brussels on tuesday and wednesday, the organization for security and cooperation in europe in vienna on thursday and paris on friday. the question is whether european officials believe him, given tensions during his april visit to europe, when reuters reported tillerson initially planned to skip a nato meeting in brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies.  if there were expectations that tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over american foreign policy   those expectations have been disappointed,  said niels annen, foreign policy spokesman for germany s social democrats in parliament.  on his watch, the state department has become a non actor.  despite tillerson s pledge to reform the u.s. foreign service, european governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the state department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.  the french have gone around tillerson to develop contacts with u.s. secretary of defense jim mattis, white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and white house chief of staff john kelly, while the eu s top diplomat federica mogherini has gone directly to vice president mike pence. berlin has focused on capitol hill, as well as kelly, mcmaster and mattis. yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on trump s foreign policy, diplomats said. there is hope that if pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the state department after tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. pompeo is an unknown quantity in europe but is viewed as closer to trump.  we may be looking at a larger dose of trump at the state department,  if pompeo did get the job, said thomas kleine brockhoff, head of the german marshall fund s berlin office. one european diplomat said tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the trump administration was hostile to iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line,  so it never left tillerson much room.  in addition, trump s son in law jared kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on middle east peace. but europeans see trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. at a nato summit in brussels in may, the president publicly admonished european leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in u.s. military spending in europe months later. things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say. european diplomats see tillerson and mattis as instrumental in talking trump out of making any rash decisions over north korea and its nuclear program, given administration comments about  utterly destroying  the country.

" the eu s highest court ruled on wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach europe, dismissing complaints by slovakia and hungary and reigniting an east west row that has shaken the union s cohesion. the mediterranean migrant crisis which prompted mandatory quotas in 2015 for relocating asylum seekers from greece and italy has receded, easing immediate pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders who are making electoral capital from lambasting the eu while benefiting from brussels  subsidies. but defiant rejection from some ex communist states that the eu accuses of slipping on democratic standards   hungary called the judgment a political  rape  of eu law   indicated no let up in tensions that are testing the union s internal cooperation. in germany, where chancellor angela merkel is fighting for re election against opponents who criticize her for taking in over a million migrants at the height of the drama, the interior minister threatened legal action against countries which fail to take in their allotted share of syrian and other refugees. but hungary, where outspoken prime minister viktor orban has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his re election campaign for next year, branded the european court of justice ruling  appalling and irresponsible .  this decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of europe,  foreign minister peter szijjarto said.   politics has raped european law and values.  italy, now the main destination for migrants taking to the sea following measures to block the route from turkey to greece and from greece northward, has been prominent in calling for the wealthier western states to cut eu subsidies to poor neighbors which do not show  solidarity  in taking in migrants. european commission president jean claude juncker has echoed that threat, warning orban  solidarity is not a one way street . but the eu executive is also anxious to calm tensions ahead of negotiations on a new seven year eu budget that will be all the harder because of a hole left by britain s imminent departure. the commission said on wednesday it may seek fines at the ecj within weeks for hungary, poland and the czech republic if they do not start or resume taking people from the south. poland and hungary, which argue muslim immigration is a threat to their national security and stability, have in two years taken in none of their respective quotas of about 6,200 and 1,300 people. however, the executive, which is separately considering trying to suspend eastern heavyweight poland for undermining the independence of its judiciary, stressed it wanted solutions that would unite the 28 nation bloc. slovakia s prime minister said he still rejected quotas but was willing to help in other ways. and as the union digests a brexit vote last year that was partly driven by concern over migration, many states that backed the quota system in 2015 and are increasingly exasperated by polish and hungarian hostility to brussels are also reluctant to force through new policies that may bolster eurosceptics across europe who say the eu is trampling on national sovereignty.  if we push it through above their heads, they will use it in their anti eu propaganda at home,  one eu diplomat said, while noting that, with the migration crisis dropping out of the headlines, all sides might find a way to resolve the issue. the commission is working on reforms to the so called dublin rules under which people arriving in the eu must stay to claim asylum in the first country they reach. a mechanism to help the likes of greece and italy in emergencies has proved elusive. however, governments may find it easier to negotiate now that the migration is not quite so prominent in local politics. the luxembourg based ecj dismissed  in their entirety  the arguments advanced by hungary and slovakia with backing from poland and endorsed the commission s solution which eventually ordered states to take in nearly 100,000 syrians and others.  the mechanism actually contributes to enabling greece and italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate,  the court said in statement. difficulties in identifying candidates for relocation   and a reluctance of refugees to settle other than in the wealthier west of europe   saw fewer than 30,000 people relocated in two years, but the commission noted an acceleration in the program this year and said it would continue to move people northward. among the gravest problems the migration crisis caused was member states reimposing controls on internal eu frontiers. that had jeopardized one of the union s most cherished achievements and for a time appeared to threaten to disrupt internal traffic. eu migration commissioner dimitris avramopoulos said special exemptions that have allowed the likes of germany, austria, denmark and sweden to control their borders with eu neighbors should now end when they expire in two months  time.

" billionaire environmental activist tom steyer is expanding his political agenda beyond climate change to embrace issues ranging from immigration to income inequality, which he expects will be critical to mustering votes for democrat hillary clinton in the november presidential election. steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co founded in order to devote himself full time to environmental activism, said he hoped the broader agenda for his nextgen climate organization would help undermine republican nominee donald trump. he derided the new york real estate magnate’s policies as “dangerous” and “delusional.”  steyer has directed nextgen, his main advocacy arm, to delve into immigration, racial justice, wealth inequality and education instead of just environmentalism to better drive youth and minority voter turnout for the nov. 8 election. “we’re talking about a broader group of connected issues,  and we don’t think any of them stand without the others,” steyer told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the democratic national convention in philadelphia, explaining the shift. nextgen has already produced ads in california attacking trump on immigration and his temperament. in one, a group of young people are filmed listening to trump describe mexicans as rapists and drug dealers and promising to wall off the border. in another, women look into the camera as trump’s voice is heard calling women fat, disgusting, and ugly. steyer said he hoped the broader agenda for nextgen would help undermine trump. “i show him no respect,” steyer said. a trump spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. nextgen’s shift into new issues began a few months ago, steyer said, and was inspired by his work on california’s progressive fair shake commission, launched last year by a group of high profile activists, academics and former politicians focused on wealth inequality in the state.  “that was the genesis to some extent. it allowed us to look deeply at all the related issues,” he said.  nextgen has spent about $20 million so far on the u.s. election, and is likely to spend at least another $55 million by election day.  steyer, who has earned a reputation as america’s most influential environmental advocate, has had mixed results in his crusade on climate change, despite the money he has poured into mobilizing voters around the issue. steyer has battled large scale oil industry infrastructure projects like the keystone xl pipeline, which was rejected by the administration of president barack obama last year, and has sought to bolster climate friendly politicians. in 2014, nextgen pumped around $75 million into efforts to support six climate friendly democratic candidates in mid term elections, but only two of whom won their contests. in the current presidential contest, nextgen has fallen short of its aim make climate change a critical issue, eclipsed by voter rage over issues including immigration, the economy and national security.  reuters/ipsos polling shows only about 25 percent of likely american voters will make a choice on the basis of a candidate’s views on climate change, although most agree that the united states should act to combat it. steyer endorsed clinton last month after she clinched the democratic nomination following a heated battle against senator bernie sanders of vermont. clinton has said she would seek to advance renewable energy use, boost regulation and reduce u.s. consumption of oil and coal if elected.  “i can take them at their word that they are going to prioritize this,” steyer said. trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed to cut u.s. environmental regulation to expand u.s. drilling and coal mining, part of his bid to win over blue collar voters. steyer called that position dangerous.  “it would be funny if it weren’t so serious,” he said.

" after a critical win on his home turf, ohio governor john kasich begins a new phase of his long shot presidential campaign that his aides hope will ultimately propel him past republican front runner donald trump by triggering a rare contested convention. kasich’s victory in ohio’s primary on tuesday, along with the departure from the race of u.s. senator marco rubio, makes him the party establishment’s last hope of stopping the new york billionaire businessman from winning the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election. trump and his closest rival, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, are deeply unpopular among republican insiders. “i want you to know, the campaign goes on,” kasich, 63, told a victory rally near cleveland. in a reference to trump’s fiery campaign rhetoric, kasich added: “i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land.” trump, 69, notched wins in florida, illinois and north carolina on tuesday and was projected by msnbc to win a close race with cruz in missouri. but losing ohio’s winner take all contest for 66 delegates complicates his attempt to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed to win his party’s nomination before the party’s july convention in cleveland. with most of the remaining states allocating delegates proportionally, kasich’s aides believe he could prevail at a convention at which no candidate enters with a majority. “the plan is to win ohio, and some other states, and if that happens, nobody is going to have enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot,” said john weaver, kasich’s chief campaign strategist, who also worked on republican senator john mccain’s losing presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2008. kasich’s plan, according to aides, is to leverage the momentum to gather more endorsements from mainstream party insiders and republican donors.  with the wind at his back, he hopes to score more victories in upcoming primaries including pennsylvania, maryland, wisconsin, connecticut and california, where he believes the terrain is friendlier to his brand of republican moderation. to become the nominee who faces democratic contenders hillary clinton or bernie sanders — in the november election — a republican needs to win a majority of the 2,472 republican delegates. after last night’s contests, excluding missouri’s, trump leads with 619 delegates, followed by cruz with 394. kasich has 136. if no candidate reaches that threshold by the close of the last primary on june 7, the convention will almost certainly be contested — a recent historical rarity that would signal deep party rifts. no convention, by either party, has gone beyond a first ballot since 1952.  kasich has almost no hope of winning enough delegates to secure the nomination outright. ohio is the lone state he has  won. but if he can succeed in blocking trump from getting a majority, he can make a case to convention delegates that he is more electable than trump or cruz, 45, a conservative evangelical and, to date, trump’s most successful republican rival. signs of the republican establishment rallying behind kasich were on show this week. mitt romney, the republican presidential nominee in 2012 who recently blasted trump as a “fraud” in a scathing speech, campaigned with kasich in ohio on monday. “he has the kind of record that you want in washington,” romney said in north canton, ohio, on a stage next to kasich, who spent 18 years as a republican congressman and six as ohio governor. “you look at this guy, and unlike the other people running, he has a real track record.” on wednesday, kasich heads to a campaign event in pennsylvania and then holds three events in utah on friday — where romney, the former massachusetts governor, is popular with republicans. utah, with 40 delegates, votes on march 27. pennsylvania is one of five states voting on april 26. ford o’connell, a republican strategist who has stayed neutral in this year’s nominating fight, said kasich’s victory should earn him more help from party insiders. “there are really just two options left: either trump gets enough delegates, or nobody does,” o’connell said. “kasich’s win in ohio means trump must now win roughly 60 percent of the remaining delegates before the convention. i would say we now have a 50 50 chance of a brokered convention.” o’connell said that under republican party rules, a candidate must receive a clear majority of primary votes overall to become the nominee.  the history of republican nominating fights is littered with candidates who received a plurality of the votes, but not a majority, and never became the nominee. kasich’s aides are looking to history as a guide, particularly wendell willkie’s path to the 1940 republican nomination. that year, three leading candidates – robert taft, thomas dewey and arthur vandenberg – each arrived at the convention without enough delegates to win. willkie   a businessman and former democrat who had never before run for public office   opposed the republican party’s isolationists and was a supporter of britain’s war efforts. his cause gained momentum after the nazi blitzkrieg in europe in may 1940. after six ballots at the convention, delegates in pennsylvania, new york and michigan deserted other candidates and switched to willkie, giving him victory. trump, cruz and kasich could face the same scenario this year, which would force to them to lobby delegates on the convention floor until one emerged with a majority. “a lot of people who do not want trump have been sitting back to see how kasich and rubio do in their home states on tuesday,” said republican strategist charlie black, who signed up on tuesday night as a kasich adviser.

" alphabet inc’s google unit told u.s. election regulators in a letter seen by reuters on thursday that it “strongly supports” tightening rules on online political advertising as part of efforts to curtail “foreign abuse and influence” in elections. federal lawmakers have criticized google, facebook inc and twitter inc for not doing enough to identify and block russian agents from buying ads on their services. u.s. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. u.s. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections. in september, the federal election commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. it opened a public comment period that is set to expire monday. in the letter, google on thursday offered its formal response to the fec’s deliberation.  “now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in u.s. elections,” the company wrote.  the stance marks an about face from 2010 when google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. the commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time. google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to tv and print ads to the web. “google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.” the company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the internet.  ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as rt, a russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on facebook and google’s youtube service. in its letter, google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. in addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.  technology news website recode first reported the google letter.

" saudi arabia accused lebanon on monday of declaring war against it because of aggression by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah, a dramatic escalation of a crisis threatening to destabilize the tiny arab country. lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between saudi arabia and iran since the saudi allied lebanese politician saad al hariri quit as prime minister on saturday, blaming iran and hezbollah in his resignation speech.    saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan said the lebanese government would  be dealt with as a government declaring war on saudi arabia  because of what he described as aggression by hezbollah. faulting the hariri led administration for failing to take action against hezbollah during a year in office, sabhan said  there are those who will stop (hezbollah) and make it return to the caves of south lebanon , the heartland of the shi ite community. in an interview with al arabiya tv, he added:  lebanese must all know these risks and work to fix matters before they reach the point of no return.  he did not spell out what action saudi arabia might take against lebanon, a country with a weak and heavily indebted state that is still rebuilding from its 1975 90 civil war and where one in four people is a syrian refugee. there was no immediate comment from the lebanese government.  hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the lebanese parliament and in the hariri led coalition government formed last year. its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring syria, another theater of saudi iranian rivalry where hezbollah has fought in support of the government. lebanese authorities said on monday the country s financial institutions could cope with hariri s resignation and the stability of the lebanese pound was not at risk. but the cash price of lebanon s u.s. dollar denominated bonds fell, with longer dated maturities suffering hefty losses as investors took a dim view of the medium  to longer term outlook for lebanon. hariri cited a plot to assassinate him during his unexpected resignation speech broadcast from saudi arabia which caught even his aides off guard. he also slammed hezbollah and iran, accusing them of sowing strife in the arab world. hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah has said he will not comment on hariri s speech, calling it a  saudi statement  and saying riyadh had forced hariri to resign. the sudden nature of hariri s resignation generated speculation in lebanon that his family s saudi construction business had been caught up in an anti corruption purge and he had been coerced into resigning.  saudi foreign minister adel jubeir said it was  nonsense  to suggest hariri had been coerced into quitting in a cnn interview on monday. hariri had quit because hezbollah had been  calling the shots  in the government, he said. hariri, a saudi citizen, was free to leave the country at any time, he said. interior minister nohad machnouk, a senior member of hariri s political party, said he was under the impression hariri would return to beirut within days.  a meeting between saudi king salman and hariri in riyadh on monday proved  rumors  wrong, he said   an apparent reference to speculation that hariri was detained or forced to quit.    earlier on monday, president michel aoun, a political ally of hezbollah, appealed for national unity. parliament speaker nabih berri, another political ally of hezbollah, said in a televised statement after meeting aoun it was too early to talk about forming a new government. the crisis could re aggravate tensions between sunni and shi ite muslims and afflict lebanese government with paralysis once again. all of the sides have called for calm and there has been no sign of unrest since hariri s resignation. the hariri led government took office last year in a political deal that made aoun president. the deal ended years of deadlock, and last month it produced lebanon s first budget since 2005. hariri flew to saudi arabia on friday after meeting in beirut the top adviser to iran s supreme leader, who described the coalition as  a victory  and  great success  afterwards.

" the u.s. congress is struggling through another contentious week as infighting over defense spending, healthcare and other matters complicates the drive to pass a temporary spending bill by midnight on friday to avert a partial government shutdown. in a week when president donald trump and his fellow republicans in congress are hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation, many in the party showed little appetite for a government shutdown at week’s end. but they sounded resigned to having to navigate through some drama over a package that includes so many disparate components, which could make for a messy process. “i’m going to vote for whatever i need to, to keep the government open,” republican representative chris collins told reporters. the last time government agencies had to shut down because washington could not pay its bills was in october 2013. leading republicans in the senate and house of representatives expressed optimism that a funding bill, coupled with a large new disaster aid package, would pass by friday’s deadline. but some were predicting that lawmakers would bump right up against the cutoff. the house could vote as soon as wednesday on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs through jan. 19. democrats are likely to mainly oppose the bill, arguing that their priorities are being ignored. conservative republicans are insisting on higher military funding through the rest of the fiscal year ending on sept. 30 as part of the house bill. democrats in the senate are expected to block that formula if, as expected, it does not also have more money for non defense programs. the house measure would also include $81 billion in disaster funding to help puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and several u.s. states recover from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. that price tag has made some republicans uneasy. some republicans are also worried about a senate strategy to add a bipartisan healthcare proposal to the government funding bill, in keeping with a promise senate majority leader mitch mcconnell made in order to coax republican senator susan collins to vote for the tax legislation. conservative house republicans do not like the bipartisan healthcare proposal because it would fund subsidies for low income participants in the obamacare health insurance program, and does not include language that restricts federal funds for abortion. mcconnell’s promise to collins “means squat over here,” said representative mark walker, chairman of the republican study committee, the largest group of conservatives in the house. some conservatives may vote against the funding bill in protest, he told reporters outside the house. the house bill also would extend the children’s health insurance program for five years. if democrats continue to withhold their support for the stopgap spending bill and some republicans peel off, congress could find itself struggling to pass a bill as the clock ticks toward midnight on friday.

" egypt s security forces suffered one of their heaviest attacks after militants firing rockets and detonating explosives hit a police operation on friday in the western desert, authorities and security sources said on saturday. three security sources said at least 52 police officers and conscripts had been killed in gun battles that erupted in the remote desert, but egyptian authorities said only 16 men had died when their patrol came under attack.  egyptian authorities on saturday said two police operations were moving in on a suspected militant hideout on friday when one of the patrols came under fire from heavy weapons in a remote area around 135 km southwest of cairo. the interior ministry said 16 police were killed in that part of the operation, and 13 more were wounded. at least 15 militants were also killed in the gun fight. the statement did not give details on any casualties in the other police patrol.  as soon as the first mission approached the location of the terrorist elements, they sensed the arrival of the forces and targeted them using heavy weapons from all directions,  the interior ministry said in a statement. one security source said the convoy was attacked from higher ground by militants firing rocket propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices on the ground. security has been a key point for president abdel fattah al sisi, a former military commander who presents himself as a bulwark against terrorism after leading the ouster of president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in 2013. sisi was elected on a landslide a year later. though he has yet to declare his intentions, sisi is widely expected to run for re election in april next year with little opposition. but critics say his popularity has been dimmed because of security and economic austerity policies.   no group made any claim or statement about friday s operation not far from the capital. but most of the fighting so far between militants and security forces has been in northern sinai, where an islamic state affiliate operates. security sources earlier said the police had been hunting hideout of the hasm movement, an islamist militant group blamed for attacks on judges and police around the capital. that group has in the past only carried out mostly small operations since it emerged last year. egyptian authorities say it is the armed militant wing of the muslim brotherhood, an islamist group it outlawed in 2013. most of its leadership has been jailed in a crackdown under sisi. since sisi came to power, hundreds of troops and police have been killed in often sophisticated attacks by militants in the northern sinai region, where ansar bayt al maqdis group pledged allegiance to islamic state in 2014. last sunday, at least 24 militants and six soldiers were killed in attacks on military outposts in north sinai, when more than 100 militants repeatedly attacked security outposts south of the border town of sheikh zuweid. attacks have mostly hit police and armed forces, but militants have also extended their campaign outside the sinai, targeting egypt s christians with bomb attacks on churches in cairo and other cities.

" republican senators john mccain and mike lee introduced a bill on thursday to permanently waive shipping restrictions on puerto rico, saying a temporary waiver from the trump administration is “insufficient” to help the island rebuild from hurricane maria. president donald trump’s administration earlier on thursday waived the restriction known as the merchant marine act of 1920, or the jones act, for puerto rico for 10 days, after a request by puerto rico’s governor, ricardo rossello. opponents of the jones act, which bars foreign vessels from shipping goods between u.s. coasts, say it hurts consumers on u.s. islands, including puerto rico and hawaii, by adding shipping costs to imports of basic goods like food and fuel.  mccain called the jones act an “antiquated, protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled puerto rico’s economy.”  in 2013, a federal reserve bank of new york report said the jones act hurts puerto rico’s economy. it estimated that shipping costs from the u.s. east coast to puerto rico are double what they are to the nearby dominican republic, thanks mainly to the jones act.   in addition, the u.s. virgin islands have been exempt from the jones act for decades, which opponents of the law say is unfair to puerto rico.  it was unclear whether mccain could gain widespread support for the bill that would waive the law, which is supported by shipping and security interests.   not only do u.s. ship builders support the jones act, but also a wide array of industries that build parts that go into ships, businesses that are spread throughout the country.  president donald trump, before his administration waived the law temporarily, pointed out that “a lot of shippers and ... a lot of people that work in the shipping industry” did not want the restrictions waived for puerto rico. in 1998, mccain sponsored legislation to allow waivers of the law, a measure that created exemptions that are in place today. in 2010, 2015 and this past july he introduced legislation to fully repeal the restrictions.

" hotels in las vegas and washington owned by u.s. president elect donald trump reached agreements with their workers’ unions that will end a series of cases alleging the hotels violated federal labor law, the trump organization and unions said on wednesday. more than 500 food and beverage and housekeeping employees at the trump international hotel las vegas entered into a four year collective bargaining agreement effective jan. 1 that guarantees annual raises and pension and healthcare benefits, trump hotels and unite here culinary workers union local 226 said in a joint statement. under the agreement, the union will withdraw a series of cases filed with the u.s. national labor relations board against the hotel, union spokeswoman bethany khan said. those cases had been expected to be an early test of how trump, who as president will have influence over the nlrb, would handle concerns over conflicts of interest raised by his business holdings. trump takes office on jan. 20. alan garten, general counsel of the trump organization, said in an interview the company was moving to resolve legal disputes that could raise concerns about conflicts. “(it is) certainly better to avoid distraction, but we’re going to continue to move forward on matters where we think we’re in the right,” garten said. trump hotels also agreed to permit workers at the trump international hotel washington d.c., which opened in october, to organize, the company said on wednesday. last week, democrats in the u.s. congress called on trump to divest from the washington hotel, which is in a building leased from the federal government, saying the lease would pose a conflict of interest because he would essentially be both its landlord and tenant once he is sworn in. eric danziger, chief executive of trump hotels, called unite here local 25, the union organizing workers at the hotel, which is down pennsylvania avenue from the white house, an “important partner” in a statement. “we share mutual goals with the union, as we both desire to ensure outstanding jobs for the employees, while also enabling the hotel to operate successfully in a competitive environment,” he said. as part of the agreement, the trump organization will end its appeal of a november nlrb decision that said it violated workers’ rights to organize at the las vegas hotel. the trump organization still faces a pending case at the nlrb claiming it required thousands of u.s. employees to sign unlawfully broad confidentiality agreements.

" south africa s ruling african national congress has adopted a resolution calling for the nationalization of the central bank and land expropriation without compensation, a senior party official said on wednesday. any mention of nationalization in south africa is enough to spook investors, since left wing elements of the anc have also called for mines and banks to be state owned. similarly, land is an emotive issue two decades after the end of apartheid, and the anc has been under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership. unlike most central banks in the world, the south african reserve bank has been privately owned since it was established in 1921. but its shareholders have no control over monetary policy, financial stability policy or banking regulation. following a meeting of party delegates, the head of the anc s economic transformation committee, enoch godongwana, told reporters changing the ownership of the south african reserve bank would not affect its independence. he said the party had also agreed to initiate amendments to the constitution to achieve land expropriation without compensation, but gave no timeline. he said there would be no illegal occupation of land. following the proposal made in july by the anc at a policy conference to nationalize the bank s shareholding, south africa s reserve bank said that changing its shareholding would not affect its mandate, because that mandate is derived from the constitution. godongwana said no timeline had been laid down for the plan to acquire the central bank s shares or for any directives to parliament to change the country s laws to effect the change.  no change in the constitution, no change in the reserve bank act,  he said.  we ve also said it s not likely to have an impact at all because shareholders in the reserve bank do not affect monetary policy in any way.   godongwana said the changes would come after  more work  was done to prepare for the bank s nationalization. in july, when the party said it would like the central bank to be wholly state owned, investors were initially worried and knocked the rand.  the currency was little changed on wednesday immediately after the announcement by godongwana, but analysts said markets would react negatively.  the sarb resolution will spook the markets even if it is ultimately unlikely to be implemented,  said anne fruhauf political analyst with consultancy teneo. on the land issue, godongwana said some of the delegates became  rowdy  during the heated debate that  nearly collapsed the conference . anc officials rejected reports that delegates had come to blows during the debate. godongwana said the delegates eventually agreed to initiate some amendments to the constitution in order to achieve expropriation of land without compensation.  the condition is that it must be sustainable and not impact on food  production and food security,  he said, adding that there should be no illegal occupation of land. asked how the markets would react, godongwana said:  my suspicion is they are going to say  wow  and react badly ... my sense is, if i was the markets, i would simply hold off.  most of south africa s land remains in white hands 23 years after the end of white minority rule. experts say the plan to expropriate land in south africa will not signal the kind of often violent land grabs that took place in neighboring zimbabwe, where white owned farms were seized by the government for redistribution to landless blacks. however, some economists and farming groups have said the reform could hit investment and production. around 8 million hectares (20 million acres) of land have been transferred to black owners since apartheid ended, equal to 8 to 10 percent of the land in white hands in 1994, the government says. the total is only a third of a 30 percent  target by 2014 set by the anc.

" u.s. senator dick durbin, the chamber’s second ranking democrat, had a procedure on tuesday in chicago to correct an irregular heartbeat, his office said.  durbin, 72, was treated at northwestern memorial hospital for an “atrial flutter,” which occurs when the heart beats too quickly. the condition was discovered during a recent annual physical, the illinois lawmaker’s office said.  “i anticipate that this heart tune up will give my classic roadster many more miles of reliable service,” durbin said in a statement.  durbin had no symptoms and was able to maintain his regular schedule before and after the condition was discovered. he is scheduled to remain in illinois for the rest of the week.   durbin used the statement about his outpatient procedure to criticize republican efforts in the u.s. congress to repeal and replace the 2010 affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare.  “my congressional colleagues who want to cut funding for medical research and take away health insurance for millions of americans should remember that all of us are only one diagnosis away from needing the best care for ourselves and the people we love,” he said.

" a suspected islamist militant wounded two policemen with a knife near the parliament in tunis on wednesday and was later arrested, tunisia s interior ministry said. it was a rare incident in a country that has improved security since deadly attacks in 2015. the assailant was known to authorities and said after the attack that he considered the police to be  tyrants , the statement said. one of the policemen was taken to hospital for treatment after being wounded in the neck, while the other was only lightly wounded, it said.   i saw a young man with a thick beard trying to kill a policeman. he put the knife in his neck before he was pursued by a second policeman,  a witness told reuters.  he shouted  allahu akbar  (god is greatest) as he attacked the policemen.  the interior ministry said wednesday s suspect had confessed that  he had adopted takfiri thought three years ago and believes that killing security forces is a form of jihad .   takfiri thought  refers to a view that muslims should proclaim other muslims to be infidels and justify attacks against them. large numbers of police were deployed to the bardo square in the aftermath of the attack, a witness said. blood could be seen on the ground in the square. the square is opposite the parliament building and close to the bardo museum, where 21 people, mostly european tourists, were killed in an attack by three gunmen in march 2015. a security source told reuters the attacker was 25 and from ettadamen   one of the largest, poorest suburbs of tunis.  i know him well, he is the youngest in a family of six brothers including a sister who works in the parliament s administration , hamid one of the attacker s neighbors told reuters. colonel major khelifa chibani of tunisia s national guard named the attacker as zied gharbi. security forces raided his house and confiscated his personal computer and other items, he said. sofian sliti, a spokesman for judicial counter terrorism investigations said that  the attacker planned to join terrorist groups in libya . as well as the bardo killings, tunisia suffered two other major attacks in 2015, one against tourists at the beach resort of sousse and the other against presidential guards in the capital. the 2015 attacks severely damaged the economy, which has a large tourism sector at its mediterranean beaches. since then, security has been boosted at strategic sites while authorities have cracked down on militants, dismantling dozens of cells. tunisia was the only arab country where a long serving leader was toppled in the region s 2011 uprisings without triggering civil war or large scale violence. tunisian democracy activists who kept dialogue open between islamists and secularists were awarded the nobel peace prize in 2015.

" germany has tightened security at christmas markets across the country a year after a deadly truck attack on a berlin christmas market, with conservative chancellor angela merkel under fire from victims  relatives for her handling of the case. anis amri, a failed tunisian asylum seeker with islamist links, hijacked a truck on dec. 19, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded berlin christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. about 2,600 christmas markets reopened in late november with added security staff on patrol and concrete barriers to protect shoppers.  merkel this week paid a surprise visit to the site of the attack, where a permanent memorial for victims will be unveiled on tuesday. she will meet on monday with relatives of victims, many of whom say they felt neglected by the government after the attack.  in an open letter to merkel published in der spiegel magazine this month, victims and survivors complained that the chancellor had not met with them personally. kurt beck, a social democratic politician who is representing victims and survivors, told reporters merkel s handling of the tragedy stood in contrast with how the french government had responded to terrorist attacks in paris. he also blasted what he called an  unbelievable  case in which the family of one victim was sent a bill for an autopsy and then hounded by bill collectors.  there are incidents which must not be repeated,  beck said, urging the government to increase hardship compensation for the victims  relatives and the survivors. german officials say they have tightened security and increased information sharing among security forces after investigations exposed a range of failures in the amri case. but experts say much work remains to be done.   cooperation between intelligence agencies and between police authorities must be improved,  said malte roschniski, a berlin security expert.

" an alabama state court on friday rejected governor robert bentley’s request to block a legislative committee from releasing evidence about wrongdoing stemming from his relationship with a former aide to be used for impeachment proceedings. a montgomery county state court judge was still hearing arguments on friday evening over the governor’s motion to halt impeachment proceedings in the alabama house of representatives. the house judiciary committee is scheduled to begin the process on monday. bentley, who is accused of using state resources for personal use, has denied any wrongdoing and has refused to step down, as demanded by top political leaders. bentley’s troubles began last year when recordings surfaced of him making suggestive remarks to a former senior adviser, rebekah mason, before his wife of 50 years filed for divorce in august 2015. bentley has denied having a physical affair with mason, who is married. she resigned as questions about the pair’s relationship began to dominate alabama politics. on wednesday, the alabama ethics commission found that bentley probably violated ethics and campaign finance laws.     the judiciary committee’s report on friday accused bentley of ordering state law enforcement officers to track down copies of an embarrassing recording that suggested an affair with the mason. it also accused him of retaliating against an official who discovered the relationship. the committee plans to begin its impeachment process on monday. the panel’s process would lead to a recommendation to the full house on whether to impeach.    bentley remained defiant at news conference on friday. “once again, let me say, i do not plan to resign,” he told reporters without taking questions. “i have done nothing illegal. if the people want to know if i misused state resources, the answer is simply no, i have not.”  the ethics commission on wednesday said it found that bentley had accepted a contribution and made a loan to his campaign outside the legal time frame, and that he used campaign funds to pay the legal fees of mason, local media reported.  the commission has declined to disclose the evidence of its finding because it was referring it to the montgomery district attorney’s office, which could bring criminal charges against the governor.

" president donald trump’s executive order directing federal agencies to take away funding from self proclaimed sanctuary cities had one big exemption for one of his favorite constituencies: the police, who would be protected from cuts. but trump’s opponents say that very exemption makes it much more likely that a judge could strike down that section of the order as unconstitutional. it is just one example of the legal arguments that cities, immigration groups and other opponents are readying as they prepare to fight an executive order signed by trump on wednesday that would cut federal aid to “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. lawyers for the potential challengers pointed to court rulings that said the federal government can only withhold funds to local jurisdictions if the money is directly tied to the behavior it objects to. the trump administration cannot cut funds for sanctuary cities’ healthcare and education while preserving money for police, since those jobs relate more closely to immigration enforcement, said richard doyle, city attorney in san jose, california. he said it was not clear whether existing federal funding or only future grants would be targeted.    supporters of the new republican president’s actions say that sanctuary cities ignore federal law and think the white house will be able to answer with a strong case in court. federal law allows trump to restrict public assistance “of any kind where an illegal alien could possibly benefit,” said dale wilcox, executive director of the washington based conservative immigration reform law institute.  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. in new york city, mayor bill de blasio in a news conference said his chief legal officer would be in court the “hour” after any specific action to withhold money came through. “there is less here than meets the eye. this executive order is written in a very vague fashion,” said de blasio, a democrat. san francisco city attorney dennis herrera, also a democrat, said his office was still examining whether it could sue before trump made any specific move to cut funds.  trump’s order directed that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities.  omar jadwat, director of the american civil liberties union’s immigrants’ rights project, said the cities can argue “they are fully in compliance with that statute,” since they do share information with federal authorities, but offer limited cooperation when it comes to turning over immigrants who are not convicted criminals. there could also be procedural snarls to implementing the cuts, lawyers who specialize in federal grants said. if the u.s. government seeks to cut off grants to a certain recipient, it must go through a complicated process known as “suspension and debarment,” and cities would have the right to appeal. “it’s fair to say that they don’t understand the scope and reach of federal grants law,” said edward waters, who heads the federal grants practice at the law firm feldesman tucker leifer fidell in washington, referring to the trump administration. the white house would also have to negotiate with states that are home to sanctuary cities. nearly 90 percent of $652 billion the federal government handed out through more 1,500 separate grant programs in the most recent fiscal year went to states, not directly to cities, according to a reuters review of federal spending data. if the trump administration wanted to try to cut off medicaid money to chicago, for example, it would have to work through the state government of illinois, which could pose an additional barrier, waters said. advocacy groups for immigrants’ rights said they are also preparing their own legal challenges to other aspects of two executive orders trump signed on wednesday, examining sections that deal with expanding detention of immigrants and changing how asylum requests are processed.  “all of our legal research is done, most of the complaints are all drafted,” said marielena hincapie, executive director of the national immigration law center, based in los angeles. she said litigation could be filed in the next days.

" suffering itself after two major earthquakes last month, mexico plans to send aid including water and electricity experts to puerto rico, a u.s. territory reeling from the devastation of hurricane maria. the gesture, announced by the mexican government on wednesday, follows an awkward series of exchanges between mexico and the united states over emergency aid in recent weeks. mexico plans to send some 30 tons of bottled water, mosquito repellent and specialists in power generation, transmission and distribution from the state power utility, mexico s foreign ministry said in a statement. the federal electricity commission (cfe) team would work to mitigate the damage and assist in restoring power supply after maria, the ministry said. the strongest hurricane to hit puerto rico in nearly 90 years, maria caused at least 34 deaths and inflicted widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including wiping out power across the caribbean island. mexico has had strained relations with its northern neighbor since u.s. president donald trump took office in january, promising to build a wall along the u.s. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs.  mexico had planned to send material assistance to the united states after hurricane harvey, which hit texas in late august, but later withdrew the offer after the first of the two quakes struck southern mexico in early september. trump was criticized in mexico for the time he took to offer condolences to his mexican counterpart, enrique pena nieto, over the first quake, which killed at least 98 people. the u.s. president later said he had been unable to reach pena nieto because of poor cellphone reception. ironically, after maria struck puerto rico, the local cellphone operator of mexican billionaire carlos slim proved more reliable than some u.s. competitors during the early days of the communications outage across the island of 3.4 million people.

" the fbi will recommend to the justice department that no charges be filed over hillary clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, agency director james comey said on tuesday, lifting a cloud of uncertainty looming over her white house campaign. the agency found evidence of “extremely careless” handling of emails by clinton, and that at least 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent, said comey, announcing the result of a yearlong investigation. but the fbi concluded that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against clinton, he said. “although the department of justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” comey told reporters in washington. his recommendation will likely stand. the country’s top prosecutor, u.s. attorney general loretta lynch, said on friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the fbi director on whether to charge clinton for mishandling emails.  the fbi probe has dogged the presumptive democratic presidential nominee’s campaign for the past year and has contributed to her low poll ratings on honesty and trustworthiness. republicans pointed to the controversy as evidence that clinton considered herself above the law. donald trump, clinton’s republican rival for the nov. 8 election, has hammered her on the issue, saying the investigation should disqualify clinton from being president. on tuesday, he said the fbi decision was unfair. “the system is rigged,” he said on twitter. “as usual, bad judgment.” the fbi has been investigating whether clinton broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her chappaqua, new york, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. one of the questions is whether she mishandled classified information on the server. clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private server. she had a  voluntary 3 1/2 hour interview with the federal bureau of investigation on saturday in washington. comey said, however, there was “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.”  but he said the fbi did not find that clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and there was no “intentional misconduct” by her lawyers who sorted her emails. he said her staff should have known the server was in an improper place for her emails. comey also said there was no evidence that anyone had hacked clinton’s communications, although it was possible. republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the justice department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. republican criticism increased after clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, met privately with lynch last week. lynch later said she regretted the meeting and the two did not discuss the investigation.

" donald trump has repeatedly called this year’s presidential election rigged and has coyly said “i will keep you in suspense” on whether he would accept a hillary clinton victory, but many republicans are less circumspect, according to a new poll. only half of republicans would accept clinton, the democratic nominee, as their president. and if she wins, nearly 70 percent said it would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on friday. conversely, seven out of 10 democrats said they would accept a trump victory and less than 50 percent would attribute it to illegal voting or vote rigging, the poll showed. the findings come after repeated statements by trump that the media and the political establishment have rigged the election against him. he also has made a number of statements encouraging his supporters to fan out on election day to stop ineligible voters from casting ballots. the u.s. government has accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations and state election systems. clinton has said she will accept the results of the election no matter the outcome. the poll showed there is broad concern across the political spectrum about voting issues such as ineligible voters casting ballots, voter suppression, and the actual vote count, but republicans feel that concern more acutely. for example, nearly eight out of 10 republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the final vote count. and though generally they believe they will be able to cast their ballot, only six out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. among democrats, about six out of 10 are concerned about the vote count. they, too, believe they wi1l be able to cast their ballot, but eight out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. “republicans are just more worried about everything than democrats,” said lonna atkeson, a professor at the university of new mexico and head of the center for the study of voting, elections, and democracy. additionally, seven out of 10 republicans are concerned about issues such as vote buying, faulty voting machines, or confusing ballot designs. six out of 10 democrats feel the same way. nearly eight out of 10 republicans are concerned that ineligible voters, including non citizens, will illegally cast ballots. four out of 10 democrats feel the same way. six out of 10 respondents, regardless of party, say they are concerned about issues such as voter intimidation and suppression.  atkeson said the level of concern and mistrust in the system, especially among republicans, is unprecedented. “i’ve never seen an election like this. not in my lifetime. certainly not in modern history.” the difference, she said, is trump. “it has to be the candidate effect.”  she worries that the lack of trust is dangerous. it is one thing to not trust government, but quite another to doubt the election process. “then the entire premise of democracy comes into question,” she said. about one in five democrats said they would protest if their candidate loses. slightly fewer republicans said they would do the same. fewer than one in 10 democrats said they are prepared to take up arms in opposition compared to fewer than one in 20 republicans. democrats are also are three times as likely to say they would leave the country. there is one area where there is little disagreement: most people do not expect the losing candidate to concede the race gracefully.  the poll surveyed 1,192 american adults online from oct. 17 to 21. the results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. the credibility interval for democrats is 5.1 percentage points; for republicans it is 5.5 points.

" transgender advocates vowed on wednesday to resist any effort to reverse or slow down an expansion of transgender rights made under president barack obama, fearing a rollback of his directives once donald trump succeeds him in the white house. during his eight years in the oval office, obama championed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) rights, and democrat hillary clinton had promised to keep fighting for them if she was elected. same sex marriage became legal in 2015, shifting the lgbt discussion to the still unfinished agenda of transgender rights. obama has issued regulations prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage based on gender identity and directed public schools to allow transgender students to use the public bathrooms of their choice, among other measures. “we expect that those will disappear,” said rachel b. tiven, chief executive of lambda legal, a leading gay rights group. “lambda legal will hold the line when our rights are under attack. we know how to fight the government in the courts.” trump sent mixed messages on transgender rights during the campaign. but he promised to nominate a conservative justice to fill the vacancy on the supreme court and could name an attorney general who may enforce hard line positions trump outlined during the campaign. “we’re going to fight them on anything they try to undo,” said mara keisling, executive director of the national center for transgender equality. “i’m really worried today for trans muslims and trans immigrants and trans people with disabilities who have been threatened and denigrated by mr. trump. hopefully, that was all part of some sick performance.” with the u.s. supreme court split between four liberals and four conservatives, trump could appoint a conservative to tip the balance, possibly in time to decide a case involving a transgender boy who has sued to use the male restroom at his public school in virginia. shannon minter, legal director for the national center for lesbian rights, called trump’s victory “a huge wake up call” that placed an onus on transgender people to “explain who we are” to trump voters who may be intolerant of or ignorant about transgender people. “in a very real sense, our lives, our ability to work, to attend school, to obtain health care, are at the mercy of a new administration,” minter said. trump’s justice department and appointees to the federal bench could also have an impact on two provisions of federal law banning discrimination on the basis of sex   title vii of the civil rights act, which covers employment, and title ix of the education amendments of 1972. the obama administration has taken a firm stance that the reference to “sex” protects transgender people. the courts have generally agreed, and jill gaulding, co founder and legal director of gender justice, said that trend was likely to continue regardless of who is president. “we can never take any rights for granted but i also think it’s important to remember how much progress we have made in recent years and decades,” she said. “it’s not easy to repeal that kind of progress.” ",0
" thousands protested outside the u.s. embassy in the indonesian capital on sunday against u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital, many waving banners saying  palestine is in our hearts . leaders in indonesia, home to the world s largest muslim population, have joined a global chorus of condemnation of trump s announcement, including western allies who say it is a blow to peace efforts and risks sparking more violence. thousands of protesters in muslim majority countries in asia have rallied in recent days to condemn the u.s. move. israel maintains that all of jerusalem is its capital. palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and say trump s move has left them completely sidelined. palestinian people were among the first to recognize indonesia s independence in 1945, sohibul iman, president of the controversial islamist opposition prosperous justice party which organized the rally, told protesters. indonesia should be more proactive in  urging the organisation of islamic conference (oic) member states and u.n. security council and the international community to respond immediately with more decisive and concrete political and diplomatic actions in saving the palestinians from the israeli occupation and its collaborator, the united states of america,  iman said.  indonesia as the world s largest muslim country has the largest responsibility toward the independence of palestine and the management of jerusalem,  he told reporters, adding that he hoped indonesia would take a leading role within the oic on the matter.   trump has disrupted world peace. it s terrible,  one protester, yusri, told reuters. the decision was  a major disaster for the palestinian people, while the palestinian s own rights have been taken away for a long time,  said septi, a student at the rally. violence erupted for a third day in gaza on saturday in response to trump s decision, which overturned decades of u.s. policy towards the middle east.  indonesia s foreign minister left for jordan on sunday to meet the palestinian and jordanian foreign ministers  to convey indonesia s full support for palestine .

" a federal judge on wednesday dismissed a lawsuit against republican presidential front runner donald trump’s modeling agency, saying there was insufficient evidence a foreign born model had been misled or was owed back pay. u.s. district judge analisa torres found that alexia palmer had not provided proof that trump model management llc fraudulently applied for a u.s. visa for her or that she had been denied fair wages. attorneys for both palmer and the modeling agency could not be immediately reached for comment. lawyers for trump, who owns the agency but was not named directly in the suit, have called the case “frivolous” and “without merit.” palmer, a jamaica native, sued in october 2014, alleging    that for her three year contract with the agency, she was promised a $75,000 a year salary, but received just $3,880.75. she sought $250,000 in back pay. the lawsuit also alleged palmer’s experience was part of a grander scheme to “lure foreign models to the united states” and cheat them out of their pay. but torres said there was not enough evidence to prove that palmer had worked the requisite number of hours over the three years to justify a minimum hourly wage complaint or warrant back pay. the case’s dismissal was a setback for attorneys who sought to bring a class action against the agency on behalf of models. a group lawsuit could have drawn additional attention to trump’s employment of foreign born workers as he seeks the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election. trump, a billionaire new york businessman, has acknowledged legally using foreign workers in his businesses but has said his experience would allow him to reform a visa system that can be easily manipulated. the case is alexia palmer v. trump model management, et al., u.s. district court, southern district of new york, no. 14 08037.

" a congressionally appointed panel on wednesday called for the creation of a u.s. museum of women’s history, with preferred sites on or near washington’s national mall. the american museum of women’s history would close a gap in the u.s. capital, which has museums devoted to everything from space and spies to stamps and black history, but none focused on women, its backers said. “america needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country,” said the report from the seven member commission   all women   empaneled by congress in 2014. creation of the museum would call for a decade long effort to gather support and funding and to build it. the cost for a building of 75,000 square feet (6,900 square meters) to 90,000 square feet (8,400 square meters) would be estimated at $150 million to $180 million in private funds, the report said. the commission also recommended that congress donate land free of charge for the museum site or provide an existing building. the museum would become part of the smithsonian institution, the world’s biggest museum complex, overseen by a board also appointed by congress. the federal government would assume operation and maintenance costs. the panel recommended three sites for a women’s museum on or around the national mall, a vast area stretching two miles (3.2 km) from the u.s. capitol west to the lincoln memorial and often called “america’s front lawn.” one site is on the side of the mall opposite the national museum of african american history and culture, which opened in september. the second site is the smithsonian’s 19th century arts and industries building, also on the mall, and the third is on the grounds of the u.s. capitol. congress declared the mall closed to new building in 2003, but made an exception for the african american museum. with the mall already crowded with monuments and museums, washington planners are looking for ways to pay tribute to u.s. historical figures and events away from the area.

" u.s. president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the korean peninsula during a phone conversation on friday, the white house said in a statement.  trump and xi also agreed that the recent adoption of a united nations security council resolution on north korea was an important step toward achieving peace and stability on the  peninsula, it added.  “president trump and president xi agreed north korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior,” the statement said. the white house said the “relationship between the two presidents is an extremely close one, and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the north korea problem.” ",0
" the u.s. government on friday said it was temporarily waiving a law that limits the availability of cargoes on the u.s. coasts, a step that will ensure enough fuel reaches emergency responders during hurricane irma and in the wake of hurricane harvey.  the jones act mandates the use of u.s. flagged vessels to transport merchandise between u.s. coasts. the department of homeland security waived the requirement for one week. this will allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax free, or more readily available foreign flagged vessels. harvey, which hit texas with record floods, had a wider effect of disrupting fuel distribution across florida, georgia and other southeastern states by shutting refineries and pipelines.  with hurricane irma, one of the most powerful atlantic storms in a century, expected to hit florida in days, the region will experience “one of the largest mass evacuations in american history” and see historic levels of restoration and response crews, said elaine duke, acting secretary of homeland security. waiving the jones act will ensure there is fuel to support lifesaving efforts and restore services and infrastructure in the wake of the storm, duke said.

" barack obama might seem an unlikely investor in the firearms industry. but the u.s. president, a fierce advocate for gun regulation, has money in a pension fund that holds stock in gun and ammunition companies. although obama’s stake is minuscule, worth no more than $30, it reflects a much larger surge of investment. the president is among millions of americans buying into gun companies   often unwittingly   as mutual funds have increased such holdings to record levels, according to a reuters analysis of institutional investment in firearms companies. since obama was elected in 2009, mutual funds have raised their stakes to about $510 million from $30 million in the nation’s two largest gun manufacturers with publicly traded shares, smith & wesson corp swhc.o and sturm, ruger & co (rgr.n). that means such stocks are now common in retirement and college savings plans.  the influx has helped to boost both companies’ shares by more than 750 percent during the obama presidency; each now has a market value of about $1 billion. beyond mutual funds, such investments also are held in the portfolios of hedge funds and public pension plans, which are harder to track. the white house declined to comment on obama’s holdings in the illinois general assembly’s pension plan, which he earned while serving in that state’s senate. the president has disclosed between $50,000 and $100,000 in the plan.  other indirect investors in firearms companies include advocates for gun regulation in the u.s. congress and several parents of children who attended sandy hook elementary school in connecticut   site of the 2012 massacre of 20 students and six staff members.  fund managers are drawn to the stocks by surging sales. buyers are arming themselves, analysts said, in response to mass shootings and calls for tougher gun laws. by the end of 2015, more than 150 mutual funds owned smith & wesson shares, up from 53 at the end of 2008, and nearly 130 held stock in ruger, up from 52, according to data from morningstar inc. it would have taken investors “minimal due diligence” to see massive profit potential in ruger stock when obama was first elected, said ruger chief executive mike fifer. shares hit a low of $4.50 the friday after that tuesday election; the stock was changing hands today at $61.61. “orders at every level of the distribution channel exploded” the week of obama’s election, fifer recalled. “and continued to do so for months afterward.” america’s leading ammunition maker, vista outdoor inc (vsto.n), has drawn investments from 319 funds in its first year of public trading and now has a market value of $2.9 billion. its bonds are owned by a who’s who of u.s. investment and insurance companies. (for a graphic of top mutual fund investors in the leading gun and ammo stocks, see tmsnrt.rs/1tlcwbz )     such investments can be hard to identify within large funds, even with concerted effort. eric milgram, a corporate research analyst whose two children were at sandy hook elementary during the rampage, tried to purge his portfolio of firearms holdings. but he gave up after a frustrating search through mutual fund stock lists, holding companies and subsidiaries. “i’m disgusted with this industry; i don’t want to be invested in it,” said milgram. but, he added, “there are only so many hours in the day.” vanguard group, the nation’s largest fund company, said it was unrealistic to balance political sensibilities with obligations to meet performance benchmarks. “it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill these obligations while managing portfolios that reflect the social concerns of all our clients,” said vanguard  spokeswoman arianna stefanoni sherlock. vanguard does, however, offer a social index fund – with about $2 billion in assets out of vanguard’s total of about $3.4 trillion – that excludes firearms companies along with other stocks involved in an array of ethically sensitive industries. smith & wesson declined to comment for this story. vista outdoor did not respond to requests for comment. obama and his tiny stake are typical of most americans with holdings in firearms investments: they are invested in funds that buy shares of the relatively small part of the firearms industry that is publicly traded. but collectively, their investments are a boon to the gun industry and amount to a sizable stake in major gun and ammo makers.  for some gun safety advocates, the amounts are less important than the principle. po murray, who put four children through sandy hook elementary, has also struggled to determine whether her investments include firearms companies. “it’s a real surprise: you find out you could be invested indirectly in smith & wesson,” said murray, who chairs the newtown action alliance, a gun safety group. “i don’t want to be invested in gun companies.” the $16 billion illinois pension fund that includes obama’s investment holds at least $4.8 million in shares of gun industry stocks, including smith & wesson, ruger, vista and ammunition maker olin corp (oln.n).  until 2014, the pension fund owned about $1.5 million of the debt of remington outdoors, another gun manufacturer. remington did not respond to requests for comment.  the illinois pension plan also invests in at least one mutual fund with gun industry exposure. the $1.1 billion templeton global smaller companies fund owned $9.5 million of smith & wesson stock at the end of december, fund disclosures show. obama and other plan participants have no say in how the money is invested. that’s controlled by the illinois state board of investment, which said it has no policy on investing in firearm and ammo companies.  (for a graphic showing firearms investments by obama’s illinois pension fund, see: tmsnrt.rs/1tlcrv0 ) in its analysis, reuters used mutual fund holdings data from morningstar and lipper inc, a thomson reuters company, to examine firearms investments during the obama presidency.  the list of funds holding such stocks includes some of the biggest and most prominent, such as vanguard and the second largest fund group, fidelity investments. it extends to blackrock inc (blk.n), and dimensional fund advisors. the analysis is based on disclosures made by individual funds. some of the gun stockholders are passively managed index funds. but many are actively managed, such as fidelity’s $40 billion low priced stock fund (flpsx.o), which has become smith & wesson’s second largest mutual fund investor under storied stock picker joel tillinghast. the fund held about 1.1 million shares worth $20 million as of oct. 31, according to fund disclosures. fidelity and dimensional declined to comment. blackrock   the world’s largest asset manager with $4.6 trillion under management   manages $200 billion of that total in investment options that screen out certain stocks, including companies involved in  firearms, tobacco and alcohol businesses, spokesman peter mckillop said. obama isn’t the only gun regulation advocate with gun industry holdings. former congresswoman carolyn mccarthy   elected after her husband was killed in the 1993 long island rail road shooting   pushed relentlessly for gun safety legislation. while in office, she held shares worth between $3,003 and $45,000 in at least three exchange traded funds with stakes in gun and ammo companies, according to her last financial disclosure before retiring last year. she also invested between $2,002 and $30,000 for two grandchildren in so called 529 college savings plans that include a vanguard fund holding firearms stocks, disclosures show. the new york democrat could not be reached for comment. as a federal retirement benefit, members of the u.s. congress can participate in a thrift savings plan, which offers an investment option   the s fund   that holds stock in firearms companies. financial disclosures show that s fund investors include senator dick durbin of illinois, the second ranking senate democrat and a leading advocate for stricter background checks for gun buyers. durbin disclosed an s fund investment of about $115,000.  durbin’s office declined to comment. some members of congress welcome the investment option. “i’m just grateful the fund managers are investing in something that’s making money,” said representative kevin cramer, a north dakota republican who opposes gun restrictions and has a small investment in the s fund. for all the debate, obama has made no progress in passing tougher gun laws. measures such as universal background checks have withered in congress, where the number of anti gun control republicans has grown.  calls for tighter controls have been met with bursts of gun sales, according to u.s. background check data on gun purchasers. gun store owners attribute the extra sales to consumers who fear the president will make it harder to buy arms. “let’s just say he’s been good for business,” jack lesher, manager of chuck’s firearms in atlanta, said of obama. gun sales jumped again recently after the president blasted congressional inaction on gun control and vowed to use executive powers to expand background checks for buyers and bolster licensing requirements for dealers. his announcement followed yet another mass shooting, on dec. 2 in san bernardino, california, where a couple pledging allegiance to islamic state killed 14 people.  for the week that ended dec. 20, firearms background checks   a proxy for guns sales   totaled 839,109, the second highest week since 1998. only the week after the sandy hook shootings was higher, according to the federal bureau of investigation.  vista’s main factories have churned out bullets 24 hours, seven days a week for at least two years, vista chief financial officer stephen nolan told investors in november.  now the industry is ready for an election year surge.  “the politics of gun control could stay in the headlines, which we believe could lead to a record year,” wrote chris krueger, senior research analyst at lake street capital markets, in a note to investors in january. ruger is boosting inventories to prepare, after learning a costly lesson going into the last presidential election. demand peaked that year, based on the number of fbi background checks sought for new gun purchases. the surge followed obama’s re election and the sandy hook shooting. “when we went into late 2011, we got cleaned out of inventory … even though we increased production dramatically,” company ceo fifer told investors during a november conference call.  the company, he said, “probably left money on the table.” ",0
" mick mulvaney, white house budget chief and acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), said on monday he has no intention of firing leandra english, who had attempted to block him from taking control of the agency. former cfpb head richard cordray had named english to lead the bureau following his resignation last month, but that appointment had been mired in turmoil after u.s. president donald trump had assigned mulvaney to the same role. a u.s. district court judge last week sided with trump, saying the law gave mulvaney the right to lead the consumer finance watchdog, but english is challenging the decision. during a news briefing at the cfpb on monday, mulvaney told reporters he would “absolutely not” consider firing english and that he would like her to continue to serve as deputy director but had not had any direct contact with her. english could not immediately be reached for comment through her lawyer, deepak gupta. since arriving at the cfpb, mulvaney has implemented a hiring freeze and suspended all new regulations for 30 days. on monday, he said he was also reviewing more than 100 pending enforcement actions, including litigation as well as private settlement talks and investigations.  he declined to comment on specific cases, but said there were two litigation actions he has asked to delay and separately cited the cfpb’s case against mortgage company phh corp (phh.n) as one that “has issues” without elaborating.  the budget chief said data security was also a top priority and that he had instructed the bureau to stop collecting personally identifiable information until data security problems highlighted by the bureau’s independent audit office had been addressed. mulvaney this week brought in republican congressional lawyer brian johnson as a senior adviser and plans to quickly bring on board more political hires to help him review the bureau’s existing and pending regulations, the budget chief said.   “then i’m going to get down to the weeds of something i enjoy which is the budget, and how the agency ... is funded, how it’s structured, personnel, those types of things,” he added. trump “wants to move expeditiously” on naming a permanent replacement but the senate confirmation process is likely to take some time and mulvaney expects to be in the interim role for up to seven months, he said in an interview reuters. english is expected to formally file a preliminary injunction against mulvaney and trump this week, according to court filings.

" a budget plan crucial to president donald trump’s hopes for large scale tax cuts looked set for a close vote in the u.s. house of representatives on thursday after some republicans vowed opposition in an effort to protect a popular tax break. the rebellious faction is resisting a proposal to eliminate a federal deduction for state and local income taxes, which would hit middle class voters in high tax states like new york, new jersey and california.      the idea is one of several that have been floated as republicans craft a tax cut plan. the budget blueprint, which has already been approved by the senate, is central to their efforts to push tax legislation through congress in the face of staunch opposition from democrats. the proposal “is obviously an issue of concern to a group of members, and the shared goal is to work together to address the issue and move forward,” an aide to house majority whip steve scalise said on wednesday. with the clock ticking toward a vote, the impasse had yet to be settled. republican lawmakers had planned to meet in house speaker paul ryan’s office at 9 p.m. to try to hammer out a resolution, but the meeting was postponed until after the budget vote, which was set for 10:30 a.m. (1430 gmt). republican representative tom macarthur of new jersey told reporters it was possible there were enough votes to block the budget plan. “it’s got to be close,” he said. scalise predicted victory. “we’re going to get it done,” he told fox news channel. republicans have sketched out a tax package that independent analysts say would cut taxes for businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, but detailed legislation is not expected to be unveiled until next week. if congress approves a tax cut plan, it would hand trump his first major legislative win since he took office in january. “i am urging republicans who have questions about salt (the state and local tax deduction) to vote no tomorrow, and keep voting no until we get some compromise we can live with,” republican representative peter king of new york told reuters. an aide to republican representative tom reed of new york said there was discussion of a compromise that would call for a tax credit up to a certain income amount to replace the deduction, and that he would support it. republican representative leonard lance of new jersey told reuters he was not interested in a compromise at this time, and instead wanted the repeal provision taken off the table. “i will be voting no on the budget tomorrow,” he said.

"many americans are suspicious of he mayor of london, sadiq khan, who has strong ties to muslim extremists and was a strong supporter of hillary.khan has been on a hillary supporting tour here in the united states and he is using that platform to let us know that he doesn t feel that immigrants should assimilate.mr. khan insists:  one of the lessons from around the world is that a laissez-faire or hands-off approach to social integration doesn t work. we need rules, institutions, and support to enable people to integrate into cohesive communities and for the avoidance of doubt, i don t mean assimilation, i mean integration, and there s a difference. people shouldn t have to drop their cultures and traditions when they arrive in our cities and countries .coming from the muslim mayor who has let london go to pot with the epidemic of currently suffering from muslim ghettoisation, horrific employment rates for muslim women, an internal debate surrounding the banning of the burka, and ongoing issues such as female genital mutilation, anti-semitism, and homophobia within muslim communities.it s ironic that a man that has erased many freedoms by way of new  laws  such as british women not being allowed to travel over a certain distance from their addresses alone, and the banning of any  sexually geared  ads on the side of public transportation, i.e. models promoting products, has the nerve to state that we should essentially allow muslims to come her and continue applying sharia law when their very  tradition  violates our constitution.mr. khan needs to go back to london with his anti-freedom rhetoric. americans will never allow immigrants to come here and try to impose any traditions that may be harmful to our citizens, nor will we ever allow the nationwide implementation of their archaic  law. h/t [ young cons , breitbart  ]",1
" u.s. president donald trump has  lit the wick of war  with north korea and his country will be made to pay with  a hail of fire , a russian news agency quoted north korea s foreign minister as saying on wednesday. tensions between north korea and the united states have risen in recent weeks over pyongyang s nuclear weapons and missile programs. north korea has test fired several missiles and conducted what it said was a test explosion of a hydrogen bomb as it advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. speaking to russia s state run tass news agency, north korean foreign minister ri yong ho said his country s nuclear program guaranteed peace and safety in the region and would not be a matter of discussion.  with his bellicose and insane statement at the united nations, trump, you can say, has lit the wick of a war against us,  tass quoted ri as saying.  we need to settle the final score, only with a hail of fire, not words.  ri has previously called trump  president evil  and his comments are likely to fuel an escalating war of words between the u.s. president and north korean leader kim jong un.  we have almost reached the last point on the journey toward our final goal   to achieve a real balance of power with the united states,  he said.  our principal position is that we will never agree to any talks in which our nuclear weapons will be the subject of negotiations.

" u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump said he was taking the gloves off in his battle against democrat hillary clinton in the race for the white house after taking a scorching from speakers at the democratic national convention. trump wrapped up a five day, seven state campaign swing in colorado on friday, where for a fifth straight day his supporters chanted “lock her up” whenever he brought up clinton’s name. trump supporters say clinton deserves to be prosecuted for her handling of u.s. foreign policy as president barack obama’s first term secretary of state and for her use of a private email server while in that office. all week trump has sought to tamp down the chants by stressing that his main goal is to simply beat clinton in the nov. 8 presidential election. but as the crowd chanted the slogan in colorado springs, trump finally relented. “i’m starting to agree with you, frankly,” he said. “no more mr. nice guy.” in denver later, he changed his tune when he heard the chant. “i’ll tell you what i’d rather do, honestly, is just beat her on nov. 8 at the polls. she would be a disaster,” he said. trump was a punching bag at the democratic convention in philadelphia, which wrapped up thursday night, as speaker after speaker   including some republicans   said he lacked the temperament to be president. clinton herself said in her acceptance speech that the election represented a “moment of reckoning” for the country. in colorado springs, trump got sidetracked by a couple of disputes from last year as he tried to rebut a clinton campaign ad. that ad uses video clip from trump’s attack on fox news anchor megyn kelly in protest of her questioning of him at a debate of republican presidential contenders last august when he said afterward that blood was “coming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever.” “i was talking about her nose,” trump said in colorado springs. “i wanted to get back on the issue of taxes” at the debate. trump also brought up the case of disabled new york times reporter serge kovaleski, whom trump seemed to mock publicly in video used by the clinton ad. trump said he was depicting the reporter groveling to him. “i didn’t know he was disabled. i didn’t know it at all. i had no idea,” he said.

" several intriguing scenarios could unfold after tuesday’s u.s. election to break the deadlock over filling a supreme court vacancy that has provoked a bitter nine month standoff between president barack obama and senate republicans. obama nominated u.s. appeals court judge merrick garland on march 16 to replace long serving conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. the republican led senate, in a move with little precedent, has refused to consider the nomination, saying the winner of the presidential election should make the pick. if republican donald trump wins, garland’s nomination would be dead. trump has already put forth a list of conservative jurists as potential nominees. if obama’s fellow democrat hillary clinton wins, there are ways garland could secure senate confirmation to the lifetime post before obama leaves office on jan. 20. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell has been adamant that obama’s successor should select scalia’s replacement and that he will not consider garland’s nomination during a post election “lame duck” session. but mcconnell could come under pressure by some senate republicans to allow confirmation hearings and a vote on garland, who has a reputation in washington as a moderate, out of fear clinton could instead choose a more liberal nominee. the senate’s inaction on garland has made the supreme court a potent issue in the election. after many years of leaning conservative, a new democratic appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. scalia’s death left the court split with four liberals and four conservatives. conservative activists dismiss the notion garland is a moderate, saying he would vote with the four liberal justices on major, ideologically divisive issues. “garland is a liberal, not a centrist,” said carrie severino, a lawyer with the judicial crisis network. liberal activists like caroline fredrickson, president of the american constitution society, said republicans should move forward on garland. “he’s got every qualification you could ask for. he’s exactly the type of judge they claimed they wanted,” fredrickson said. if democrats win control of the senate in tuesday’s election, the new congressional session would begin on jan. 3, and they could decide to move forward immediately on garland’s nomination before obama’s term ends. clinton would play a major role by deciding whether or not she wanted to stick with garland, who was named to his current job by her husband bill clinton in 1997, or choose her own nominee. “chief judge garland is the most experienced nominee to the supreme court in our nation’s history,” white house spokeswoman brandi hoffine said. it is time for republicans to “stop putting politics over the best interest of the country and do their job by giving the president’s nominee to the supreme court a hearing and a vote,” she added. clinton has said garland should be confirmed this year but has not committed to re nominating him if she wins. some republicans have floated the idea of staunch opposition to any clinton nominee, raising the possibility of the seat remaining vacant long term. mcconnell has said no obama nominee will be confirmed this year. there are no signs so far of republican leaders backing off that position. garland, 63, and other members of the washington legal community joined the eight current justices inside the supreme court’s ornate courtroom on friday at an memorial event honoring scalia, four days before the election that will help decide his fate. there has been little controversy over garland’s suitability to sit on the supreme court as there has been with some past nominees. he is widely respected in the legal community and has won praise from democrats and republicans.

" the pentagon on wednesday said it would provide revised guidance to the u.s. military “in the near future” after president donald trump announced a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the u.s. military. “we will continue to work closely with the white house to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving the military,” said pentagon spokesman navy captain jeff davis, referring all questions about trump’s comments to the white house. “we will provide revised guidance to the department in the near future.” ",0
" libya s eastern based parliament voted on tuesday to approve some u.n. proposals aimed at unifying the divided north african nation, although major obstacles remain for a deal to stabilize the oil producer. the u.n. launched a new round of talks in september to end years of turmoil in libya following a 2011 nato backed uprising and unite the rival governments and parliaments in tripoli and the east. choosing the members of the presidency and the government, and settling the question of military leadership are seen as the biggest hurdles to any deal. only a minority of members of the house of representatives in benghazi took part in tuesday s vote, so it is unclear to what extent it will advance the latest push for a political deal. opposition in the house had been a key obstacle to previous u.n. peace efforts. a rival assembly in tripoli is also meant to approve the proposals. the u.n. talks were suspended in october, but the organization has been working behind the scenes. its envoy ghassan salame said last week that delegations from rival assemblies were  close to a consensus . on tuesday, a majority of about 75 members of the house present approved u.n. proposals regarding the broader structure of a future government, said fathi al marimi, an adviser to house speaker agila saleh. an unspecified number were flown in by saleh on a private plane, he said. the house session had originally been planned for monday but was postponed when a u.n. flight carrying some deputies based in western libya was prevented from landing. the u.n. proposals are aimed at relaunching a deal signed in december 2015, which produced a u.n. backed government in tripoli that has struggled to assert its authority and never been accepted by factions that control the east of the country. salame said last week that he was planning to hold a national conference in february to agree how to finalize a transition, and that the u.n. was working to establish the right conditions for holding new elections.

" vincent viola, an army veteran and founder of a high speed trading firm nominated by u.s. president donald trump to be secretary of the army, withdrew his name from consideration on friday, a u.s. official said. “secretary mattis is disappointed but understands and respects mr. viola’s decision,” a pentagon statement said, adding that secretary of defense jim mattis would recommend another candidate soon.  the military times, which first reported the news, cited viola’s inability to get around defense department rules concerning his family businesses as the reason for withdrawing his name. viola is a former chairman of the new york mercantile exchange and is a leader in electronic trading. along with virtu ceo douglas cifu, he bought the florida panthers of the national hockey league in 2013.

" peru s opposition controlled congress approved president pedro pablo kuczynski s new cabinet with a 83 17 vote of confidence on friday, the latest resetting of relations between the executive and legislative branches in his year old government. congress, dominated by the right wing popular force party, ousted kuczynski s previous cabinet in september in a dispute over a teachers strike and school curriculum that emphasizes gender equality. in response, kuczynski formed a more socially conservative cabinet led by prime minister mercedes araoz, one of his vice presidents and a lawmaker in his party. several opposition lawmakers wished araoz  cabinet luck during more than 14 hours of debate before the vote of confidence. kuczynski, a 79 year old former wall street banker, took office in july 2016 promising to modernize peru and strengthen its economy. but his first year in office has been marked by clashes with congress and slowing economic growth. araoz told local broadcaster rpp on friday that the government is planning to revise tax policies to look for ways to close loopholes that have dragged on public revenue. araoz said on thursday that she is going to ask congress to grant her cabinet special powers to legislate economic policies.

" bahrain s government has crushed dissent and violently cracked down on protests in the past year, amnesty international said on thursday, and it accused britain and the united states in particular of turning a blind eye to its abuses. amnesty said in a report on thursday that it had documented how the bahraini government, from june 2016 to june 2017, arrested, tortured, threatened or banned from travel at least 169 activists and opponents or their relatives. bahraini authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. bahrain has repeatedly denied systematic rights abuses. entitled  no one can protect you: bahrain s year of crushing dissent , the report said that at least six people were killed, including a child, in the crackdowns. the report also accused western governments, notably the united states and britain of remaining silent. the two countries have a particularly high level of influence in bahrain, where the u.s. fifth fleet is based and where britain s royal navy has a major facility.  amnesty said u.s. president donald trump s policy has shifted from that of his predecessor, barack obama, who had publicly criticized the authorities of the tiny gulf state.   in march 2017, president trump told bahrain s king hamad  there won t be strain with this administration : bahrain appears to have interpreted this statement as a green light to pursue its repression,  the report said. bahrain has stepped up a crackdown on critics, shutting down two main political groups, revoking the citizenship of the spiritual leader of the shi ite muslim community and jailing rights campaigners. it denounced attempts by previous u.s. and uk governments to intervene in its campaign. in july, a bahraini court sentenced rights campaigner and prominent activist nabeel rajab to two years in jail for allegedly making  false or malicious  statements about bahraini authorities. rajab is facing another trial and risks a further 15 years in prison for tweeting.  using an array of tools of repression, including harassment, arbitrary detention and torture, the government of bahrain has managed to crush a formerly thriving civil society,  philip luther, amnesty international s director for the middle east and north africa, said in a statement. amnesty said it had received reports of nine cases of government critics being tortured in detention, eight of them in may 2017 alone. bahrain has been a flashpoint since the sunni led government put down arab spring protests in 2011. the kingdom, most of whose population is shi ite, says it faces a threat from neighboring shi ite theocracy iran. it accuses the islamic republic of radicalizing and arming some members of its majority shi ite population in an effort to bring about the downfall of the ruling al khalifa family. tehran denies any meddling in bahrain.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on thursday said rival donald trump had no real plans to help middle class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession. “he’s offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today,” clinton said in warren, michigan, shortly after touring futuramic, a hangar like, high tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry. clinton said trump, the republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on “millionaires and wall street money managers,” and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy. clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. the new york businessman is counting on his appeal to blue collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as pennsylvania and ohio. clinton on thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the nov. 8 election. speaking to fox news later on thursday, trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the united states, while clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan. trump delivered an economic speech in detroit on monday. he publicly named his economic advisers last week, which clinton mocked as “six guys named steve.” on thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. new members included roofing billionaire diane hendricks, investor carla sands and hedge funder anthony scaramucci. workers’ anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and clinton rejected the portrait trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the trans pacific partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009 2013 but has more recently opposed. clinton also says she would renegotiate the north american free trade agreement, which was signed by former president bill clinton, her husband. trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for american jobs.  “it’s true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the american people with rosy scenarios that didn’t pan out,” clinton told the crowd of factory workers. “the answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world. “the answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,” she said. “so my message to every worker in michigan and across america is this: i will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the trans pacific partnership.” ",0
" a 2015 global pact for fighting climate change will benefit in some ways at least if u.s. president donald trump carries out a threat to pull out, backers say, in a shift from gloom about the fate of a deal that took two decades to negotiate.  the paris agreement requires consensus for all decisions, meaning the withdrawal of a recalcitrant united states would make it easier for emitters such as china and the european union to design details of a trillion dollar shift from fossil fuels.  trump has called man made climate change a hoax and made a so far unfulfilled campaign pledge to “cancel” the agreement, saying he wants to promote the domestic fossil fuel industry.  in a step to undo environmental regulations introduced under former president barack obama, trump will sign an order on tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the united states.  “there will be some advantages for other countries and there will also be extraordinary disadvantages,” if the u.s. ends up quitting paris, said christiana figueres, an architect of the agreement who was the u.n.’s climate chief in paris.  “it’s not a black and white scenario,” she said.  she said the ideal outcome, both for the united states and other nations, was for washington to stay and make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. there were better investment prospects for renewable energies such as solar power than coal, she added.  the fear has long been that a pullout of the world’s top economy would drain other nations’ willingness to cut greenhouse gas emissions under an agreement ratified by nations as diverse as china, saudi arabia and african countries.  but there is an emerging rival view that paris might be better off.  “the achilles heel of the paris agreement is that it’s built on consensus,” said johan rockstrom, director of the stockholm resilience center at stockholm university.  “it’s very difficult to have a negative giant in the room” able to obstruct all decisions, he said, adding that he had swung in recent weeks to reckon that a u.s. pullout would be better overall from an earlier view that it would be a “big failure”.  the paris agreement has few binding obligations. it lets all nations set their own goals for fighting climate change and has no penalties for non compliance.  governments have set a 2018 deadline to work out a rule book for the paris agreement, filling in details, for instance, of how nations will report and monitor their curbs on emissions.  maldives environment minister thoriq ibrahim   chair of the alliance of small island states whose members fear they are at risk from rising sea levels   urged continued u.s. participation in paris.  “the closer you look at it, the clearer it becomes that it (the paris agreement) also promotes important strategic, economic, and security benefits as well,” he said.  norwegian prime minister erna solberg also said it would be better for the united states to stay. “but i don’t think that it’s the end of the paris agreement if the united states decides to leave,” she said.  oliver geden, of the german institute for international and security affairs, disagreed. a u.s. withdrawal would badly undermine the paris agreement and any decisions would be largely irrelevant without the world’s biggest economy, he said. “the momentum could fade away pretty soon,” he predicted.  still, almost 200 nations agreed after trump’s election in november that the world had an “urgent duty” to combat an “alarming and unprecedented” rate of global warming.  “the pace and scale of change already underway in the global economy is remarkable and irreversible,” said stephanie pfeifer, head of the institutional investors group on climate change, a forum with 18 trillion euros ($20 trillion) in assets under management.  “renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created very rapidly in clean energy,” she said.  the u.s. target under paris, set by obama, is to cut emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of global efforts to avert more downpours, droughts, heatwaves and floods.  trump’s pro coal policies are likely to make u.s. emissions cuts less ambitious.  by staying in the paris agreement, trump would also undermine a demand in its article 4 that successive national climate plans have to be ever deeper cuts. a u.s. pullout would make it easier for backers to argue that the principle has not been violated.  the paris agreement sets an over riding goal of limiting global warming to “well below” two degrees celsius (3.6 fahrenheit) above pre industrial times. the united nations says that current pledges are insufficient to meet that goal.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on friday: trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe open a new chapter in u.s. japan relations with trump abruptly setting aside campaign pledges to force tokyo to pay more for u.s. defense aid. trump says he is considering issuing a new travel ban executive order, while white house chief of staff reince priebus says the administration could still escalate a legal dispute over trump’s original travel ban order to the u.s. supreme court.  several democratic u.s. senators and a republican congressman whose district includes a section of the u.s. mexico border express skepticism about trump’s proposed wall there after learning the project’s estimated cost is $21.6 billion. trump changes tack and agrees to honor the “one china” policy during a phone call with chinese leader xi jinping in a major diplomatic boost for beijing, which brooks no criticism of its claim to self ruled taiwan. russia ukraine the washington post reports white house national security adviser michael flynn privately discussed u.s. sanctions against russia with moscow’s ambassador during the month before trump took office. flynn had previously denied discussing sanctions. russian president vladimir putin proposes slovenia, the birthplace of trump’s wife, melania, as a good place for a meeting with trump, but says the decision on a location is not moscow’s alone. trump expresses support for an undivided ukraine in a letter to lithuania’s president, using language similar to that of his predecessor barack obama, and seen as likely to be welcomed by kiev and north atlantic treaty organization allies. trump says iran president hassan rouhani “better be careful” after rouhani was quoted as saying that anyone who speaks to iranians with threats would regret it. trump pulls elliott abrams as a contender for the no. 2 position at the state department after learning that the republican foreign policy veteran criticized him during the 2016 election campaign, sources say. tom price is sworn in as u.s. secretary of health, which trump says will allow his administration to fulfill his pledge to dismantle obamacare and reshape the healthcare system. the federal reserve board’s top bank regulator says he will resign, giving a boost to trump’s plans to ease reforms put in place after the 2007 09 financial crisis.

" german police detained a 29 year old man suspected of trading narcotic drugs internationally over the internet through anonymous websites and sending them by mail to customers in germany, police said on wednesday. in cooperation with dutch authorities, police seized 400,000 euros ($470,840) and 75 kg (165 lb) of ecstasy, marijuana, cocaine, amphetamine and heroin at the apartments of the suspect and at his mother in the netherlands. the dealer and his partners, using the pseudonyms  mr. drug commander  and  drugs squad , were receiving orders mostly from german customers on black market websites such as  hansa market  and  dream market , federal criminal police said. the man, who was not identified, was arrested on nov. 9 while entering germany to mail 34 shipments of drugs. a day earlier, in ingolstadt in bavaria, police had arrested a man who had ordered marijuana and amphetamines.  dutch authorities are still looking for other gang members. police said online drug shops are boosting drug consumption and trafficking, requiring a shift in approach by german authorities.  the supposedly anonymous ordering on the internet motivates more young people to buy, consume or even sell drugs for profit,  said federal criminal police in a statement. police said the investigation began in august, leading to the initial arrest in october of six people in the bavarian town of coburg, which in turn helped identified 12 other buyers. german customs police in july said they expected far more cocaine to flood into europe in the future, and had seized nearly five tonnes of the drug in northern sea ports so far this year, more than three times their total in 2016.

" u.s. congressional negotiators are making progress on resolving a dispute that has stalled a bill to impose new sanctions on russia, congressional aides said on thursday, and one lawmaker said the matter could be resolved as soon as friday. “i think as soon as tomorrow, the house (of representatives) could pass it out,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and an author of the bill, told reporters. he said he expected the house to make changes that would not affect the bill’s overall character and to address issues that have worried energy companies, such as a provision that oil firms said could block them out of international exploration projects if russian firms were also involved. hoping to send a message to president donald trump to maintain a strong line against moscow, the senate passed the sanctions on russia, part of a broader measure also imposing new sanctions on iran, by 98 2 on june 15. the bill has been mired in the house ever since. the delay has frustrated democrats, and some of trump’s fellow republicans, who think the president is so eager to improve relations with russia that he will not retaliate for moscow’s international aggression. this week, trump has been defending his oldest son, donald trump jr., who met with a russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about democratic candidate hillary clinton. republicans, who control congress, said the house could not vote on the senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues originate in the house. democrats accused republicans of stalling because of trump administration concern about a provision setting up a process for congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on russia. seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, congress has included such “review” provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with corker’s 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of president barack obama’s nuclear deal with iran. corker said he thought there should be more congressional review of foreign policy. “it’s been my goal as chairman just to bring back our equivalent status to the executive branch, and this is one way of doing so.”  house aides said negotiations on the russia bill were continuing. “no deal has been reached, but talks have been productive and will continue,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan.

" new york city’s mayor bill de blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the city’s ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. de blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the democratic party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. “at its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities,” de blasio said. “the strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for new yorkers.” de blasio said the city’s public hospital system, recently rebranded as health & hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. the executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. about a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. health & hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. that has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     the executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning july 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in january. the total budget represents a small increase over the previous year’s $81.7 billion spending plan. the executive budget increases the city’s reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. general reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the city’s capital stabilization reserve. budget officials said reserves were the highest in the city’s history. the mayor has repeatedly stressed the need to prepare for an economic downtown in which the city would have to “go it alone” with reduced federal and state support.

" lawmakers in ohio on wednesday approved legislation that would legalize marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, less than a year after recreational marijuana use was soundly defeated by ohio voters.   the bill, approved by both chambers of the state’s republican led legislature, heads to republican governor john kasich for his signature as his office said on wednesday that he will review the bill. during the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the united states have been much more receptive to making the use of marijuana legal for medical purposes than for recreational use.  some 24 states and washington d.c. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use while only a handful of states allow for recreational use. it remains illegal on the federal level.  the ohio legislation is more limiting than some in that it only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017.  “this bill is not perfect, but it’s what ohio patients need,” ohio senator kenny yuko, a democrat, said before his house approved the bill.  “marijuana is not a gateway drug, but a gateway off drugs.” medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would  create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug. in november, ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first u.s. midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. lawmakers from both parties voted for and against the bill on wednesday. some opponents of the measure have said that the qualifying list of medical conditions is too limited.  the measure was fast tracked to head off a possible less restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in november.  in a poll released in early may, 90 percent of ohio voters supported the legalization for medical marijuana.

" former u.s. republican presidential candidate mitt romney on wednesday criticized donald trump for declining to release his tax returns, saying the only explanation was that the documents contained a “bombshell” about the real estate mogul. “it is disqualifying for a modern day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters,” romney said in a facebook post about trump, who became the likely republican nominee when his rivals dropped out last week. “there is only one logical explanation for mr. trump’s refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,” romney said. “given mr. trump’s equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it’s a bombshell of unusual size.” trump has said that he will make public his tax returns on the completion of an audit.

" former president george w. bush had every intention of sticking to his self imposed exile from politics, but found that the phone kept ringing with appeals from republican u.s. senate candidates for help, friends say. as a result, bush has embarked on a rescue mission to try to preserve the republicans’ narrow senate majority in a year in which many party figures fear presumptive nominee donald trump will drag them down to defeat in the nov. 8 elections. republicans control 54 seats in the 100 member senate. “i think that this is a one off, temporary thing that where he can be helpful he will be,” said dana perino, who was bush’s white house press secretary. condoleezza rice, who was bush’s secretary of state and is now a political science professor at stanford university, is also raising money for republican candidates, but on friday ruled out speculation that she might be drafted as trump’s vice presidential running mate. “dr. rice has repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one, she’s not interested in being vice president. she’s happy at stanford and plans to stay,” said rice chief of staff georgia godfrey. friends say bush was initially reluctant to get involved, feeling his time in the limelight had passed. they said he was surprised at the appeals he was receiving to get back into politics more than seven years after his eight year white house run ended. so far bush has headlined fund raising events for senator john mccain of arizona and senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire. he plans to help senators rob portman of ohio, ron johnson of wisconsin and roy blunt of missouri. bush is no fan of trump, but to a certain extent, he is doing trump a favor in spite of the continuing antagonism toward the bush family from the bellicose new york businessman. typically, the party’s nominee is the chief fund raiser in election years, but trump’s fund raising effort has lagged. meanwhile, trump continues to take swipes at the bush family, particularly at jeb bush, the former florida governor who was defeated by trump in the republican presidential primary race. on wednesday in greensboro, north carolina, trump complained about jeb’s decision not to honor a pledge made last year to support the republican presidential nominee whoever it is. “he signed the pledge but he hasn’t endorsed me,” trump said. like his brother, jeb bush is helping raise money for republican congressional candidates. “the bush family has a deep love for the party and cares about the future and in light of trump’s capacity to damage the brand, i think this is part and parcel of doing what they can to preserve the party,” said jeb bush’s spokeswoman, kristy campbell.

" the image of the united states has deteriorated sharply across the globe under president donald trump and an overwhelming majority of people in other countries have no confidence in his ability to lead, a survey from the pew research center showed.  five months into trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed u.s. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of barack obama’s eight years in the white house.  but the falls were far steeper in some of america’s closest allies, including u.s. neighbors mexico and canada, and european partners like germany and spain.  trump took office in january pledging to put “america first”. since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, announced he will pull out of the paris climate accord, and accused countries including canada, germany and china of unfair trade practices.  on his first foreign trip as president in early june, trump received warm welcomes in saudi arabia and israel, but a cool reception from european partners, with whom he clashed over nato spending, climate and trade.  just 30 percent of mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the united states, down from 66 percent at the end of the obama era. in canada and germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.  in many european countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of george w. bush, whose 2003 invasion of iraq was deeply unpopular.  “the drop in favorability ratings for the united states is widespread,” the pew report said. “the share of the public with a positive view of the u.s. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from latin america, north america, europe, asia and africa”.  the survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between feb. 16 and may 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted obama.  both russian president vladimir putin and chinese president xi jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than trump. german chancellor angela merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.  the countries with the lowest confidence in trump were mexico, at 5 percent and spain at 7 percent. the only two countries where ratings improved compared to obama were russia, where confidence in the u.s. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.  globally, 75 percent of respondents described trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. a majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.  the survey showed widespread disapproval of trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the u.s. from some majority muslim countries.  on the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of americans in general. and in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the united states to stay roughly the same in spite of trump.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions said on thursday he would stay out of any probe into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose he met last year with russia’s ambassador. sessions, a longtime u.s. senator who was an early and high ranking player in president donald trump’s campaign before becoming the country’s top law enforcement official, announced the decision after several fellow republicans in congress suggested the move would be appropriate. “i have recused myself in the matters that deal with the trump campaign,” sessions told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. sessions said he had been weighing recusal   ruling himself out from any role in the investigations   even before the latest twist of the controversy over ties between trump associates and russia that has dogged the early days of the trump presidency. the president backed sessions, saying democrats had politicized the issue and calling the controversy a “total witch hunt.” sessions’ announcement did nothing to quell concerns among congressional democrats, a number of whom called for sessions to step down. trump and republicans who control congress are trying to move past early administration missteps and focus on issues important to them, including immigration, tax cuts and repealing the obamacare healthcare law. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump’s favor. the kremlin has denied the allegations. sessions denied he had contact with russian officials when he was asked directly during his senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with russian operatives during the election campaign. he told reporters he was “honest and correct” in his response, although he acknowledged he “should have slowed down” and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. “i never had meetings with russian operatives or russian intermediaries about the trump campaign,” sessions said, adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role. in a statement on thursday night, trump said sessions “did not say anything wrong. he could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.”      sessions’ meetings with russian ambassador sergei kislyak were disclosed on wednesday night by the washington post. sessions received kislyak in his senate office in september and also met him in july at a heritage foundation event at the republican national convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. trump fired national security adviser michael flynn last month after disclosures that flynn had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with kislyak before trump took office and that flynn misled vice president mike pence about the conversations. the recusal means sessions, a powerful member of trump’s inner circle, will not be briefed on details of any probe. should the federal bureau of investigation decide to move forward with charges, sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the department of justice should take the case. house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi urged sessions to resign and said “his narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury” were inadequate. adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said sessions’ explanation for failing to tell the senate about his meetings “is simply not credible.” he called on sessions to step down and said the justice department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate russian interference. democrats on the house judiciary committee asked the fbi to launch a criminal investigation into sessions’ statements to  congress about his communication with russian officials. sessions is one of many “subjects” of a government investigation of any contacts between the trump campaign and russia, two u.s. officials familiar with the probe said. the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said sessions was not now a “target” of the probe by the fbi, the treasury department, the cia and the national security agency. the investigation, one of the officials said, had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of trump, including flynn, and the russian embassy in washington as well as russian and some ukrainian businessmen and companies. at least two other officials in trump’s campaign said they also spoke with the russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the july convention last july, usa today reported on thursday. trump’s son in law and adviser jared kushner also met with kislyak in december at trump tower in new york, an administration official said on thursday, confirming a report in the new yorker. while there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings, the reported contacts raise questions about the white house’s repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with russian officials beyond those by flynn. trump has accused officials in former democratic president barack obama’s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about russia contacts. the white house dismissed the disclosure of the sessions meetings as a partisan attack, saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the armed services committee. trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with russia, drawing criticism from democrats and some republicans. ties with russia have been deeply strained in recent years over moscow’s military interference in ukraine, military support for president bashar al assad in syria and president vladimir putin’s intolerance of political dissent. with his administration on the defensive over russia, trump’s enthusiasm seems to have cooled, and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about moscow. the russian embassy in washington, shrugging off the uproar, said on thursday it was in regular contact with “u.s. partners.” ",0
" a greek court on wednesday backed the extradition to moscow of a russian citizen who also faces being sent to the united states on allegations of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin. alexander vinnik, the suspected mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on u.s. cybercrime charges. judges ruled last week that he should be extradited to the united states, a decision russia criticized as unjust and illegal and which vinnik is challenging at greece s supreme court. should it decide to uphold the ruling to extradite him to the united states, the final decision is in the hands of greece s justice minister, who can approve extradition to one country and block the other. vinnik denies all charges against him. but he has agreed to be returned to russia where he is to be tried on lesser fraud charges.  that is his wish   to be extradited to russia and to give his account before the russian judicial authorities,  alexandros lykourezos, the lawyer leading vinnik s defense, told reporters after the ruling in thessaloniki.  in the united states, where he faces up to 55 years in prison, vinnik is accused of running btc e   a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin   to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011. he has told greek judges that he was a technical consultant to btc e and not its operator. vinnik was arrested while on holiday in a seaside village in greece in july. russia then sought his extradition as it has done with other nationals wanted by the united states.  the supreme court hearing is expected within the next three weeks, lykourezos said.

" a north korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash over the border to south korea this week stabilized on wednesday after a second round of surgery, a doctor treating him said. the soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, was flown by helicopter to hospital on monday after his escape to south korea in a hail of bullets fired by north korean soldiers. wednesday s surgery was  successful  in terms of staunching bleeding and the soldier had  stabilized much , said lee cook jong, the surgeon in charge of his treatment. however, he remained unconscious and was not out of the woods, as complications from a severe hip fracture and possible infection remained major concerns, lee said.   we will be able to tell you after about 10 days,  lee told reporters at a briefing, when asked about the soldier s chances of surviving. on tuesday, government and military officials said the soldier was in critical condition but doctors expected him to live. the soldier made his escape in a border  peace village  on the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two koreas. at first, he sped toward the border in a four wheel drive vehicle but was forced to abandon it and flee on foot when one of its wheels came loose, south korean officials said earlier. he was hit by about seven bullets before he took cover behind a south korean structure in a joint security area (jsa) inside the demilitarized zone. doctors removed five bullets from him earlier and one more on wednesday. north korea has remained silent on the issue, while no unusual activity has been detected at the border where the soldier defected, the south s unification ministry said.   there will need to be some questioning on why he defected after his treatment is over,  ministry spokesman baik tae hyun told a regular briefing.  monday was the first time since 2007 a north korean soldier had defected across the jsa.

" donald trump’s supreme court nominee, neil gorsuch, on wednesday described as “demoralizing” and “disheartening” the u.s. president’s twitter attacks on a judge who suspended trump’s travel ban on seven muslim majority countries, a spokesman for gorsuch said. gorsuch’s comments came as a federal appeals court in san francisco was expected to decide in coming days on the narrow question of whether u.s. district judge james robart acted properly in temporarily halting enforcement of trump’s ban. a republican strategist hired by the white house to help guide gorsuch’s nomination through the u.s. senate said that gorsuch, himself an appeals court judge, used those words when he met with democratic senator richard blumenthal. trump, who took office on jan. 20, took to twitter over the weekend to condemn the friday night order by robart that placed on hold the president’s jan. 27 temporary travel ban on people from the seven countries and all refugees.  trump called robart a “so called judge” whose “ridiculous” opinion “essentially takes law enforcement away from our country.” trump’s administration appealed robart’s ruling to a three judge federal appeals panel, which heard oral arguments  on tuesday.  presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for the u.s. constitution, which ensures a separation of powers among the president’s executive branch, congress and the judiciary.  the republican led senate on wednesday confirmed immigration hardliner republican senator jeff sessions to be the next attorney general despite strong democratic opposition. trump says his executive order aims to head off attacks by islamist militants. the order, the most divisive act of trump’s young presidency, sparked protests and chaos at u.s. and overseas airports. critics said the ban unfairly targeted people for their religion. “i don’t ever want to call a court biased,” trump told hundreds of police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in a washington hotel on wednesday. “so i won’t call it biased. and we haven’t had a decision yet. but courts seem to be so political.”  trump nominated gorsuch on jan. 31 to succeed conservative justice antonin scalia on the nine member supreme court. scalia died a year ago this month.  blumenthal, a member of the judiciary committee that will hold a confirmation hearing on gorsuch, said the nominee had a responsibility to reassure americans that he would be an open minded and independent jurist by going public with his concerns about trump. the appeals court decision on whether to reinstate the ban, will be just a first step in a fast moving case. the courts will ultimately have to address questions about the extent of the president’s power on matters of immigration and national security. traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts say, although some note that the implementation of trump’s order presents unique issues. trump’s order barred travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from civil war torn syria, who are subject to an indefinite ban. also at issue is whether the order violates a provision of the u.s. constitution that prohibits laws favoring one religion over another, along with relevant discrimination laws.  trump, a republican, has made extensive use of presidential directives that bypass congress and has appeared to be taken aback by legal challenges to his travel order. he praised a federal judge in boston who earlier ruled in his favor on the travel ban as a “highly respected” jurist whose findings were “perfect.”  last year, trump accused indiana born u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel of bias in overseeing a lawsuit against one of trump’s businesses, trump university, because of his mexican heritage. democrats and other critics have called trump’s comments toward the judiciary an attack on a core principle of american democracy: that the courts are independent and uphold the rule of law.  at the meeting with law enforcement officials, trump read from the law he cited to justify the travel ban, quoting it in fragments and sprinkling in bits of interpretation. he said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determined them to be a detriment to national security. the matter is likely to go to the u.s. supreme court, which is ideologically split with four liberal justices and four conservatives pending senate action on trump’s nomination of gorsuch, a conservative jurist. u.s. state department figures showed that 480 refugees had been admitted to the united states since robart’s order went into effect, including 168 on wednesday. of those admitted, 198 were from war torn syria.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan on monday praised president elect donald trump’s choice of republican party chairman reince priebus for his white house chief of staff as the best choice for getting things done in congress. “it’s a very, very, very good sign of things to come,” ryan said in an interview with wisconsin radio station wbel. ryan said he has spoken with trump almost every day since last tuesday’s election. “hiring reince as his chief of staff is a perfect indication of our new president’s desire to get things done,” ryan said.

" a syrian man living in germany was jailed for three and a half years on wednesday for his part in the kidnapping of a u.n. peacekeeper near damascus four years ago. the man, who was not named, was found guilty of being an accessory to the abduction, according to a statement from the german court that tried him which did not go into details on what he did. the u.n. peacekeeper, who served in the demilitarized zone between syria and israel on the golan heights, was kidnapped in feb. 2013, the higher regional court in the southwestern german city of stuttgart said.  prosecutors had in january 2016 identified the syrian man as suliman a. s. under german privacy laws and said they suspected him of being a member of the islamic militant nusra front group. they said the group had demanded a ransom from the united nations, the canadian government and the peacekeeper s family in exchange for his release. the court did not give his nationality. the u.n. peacekeeper eventually escaped eight months after his abduction, the court said. it said there was not enough evidence to conclude that nusra front was behind the kidnapping nor that the syrian man was a member of the militant group.  the accused was found guilty under the code on international criminal law of being an accessory to a war crime against a peacekeeping mission that involved kidnapping for ransom, three counts of attempted robbery by blackmail and grievous unlawful detention,  the court wrote in a statement.

" iraqi shi ite militias illegally detained villagers near the islamic state held district of hawija in northern iraq and subjected them to torture and ill treatment, human rights watch said on thursday. the leader of one of the militias, which are known as popular mobilisation forces (pmf), denied the accusation and said their fighters were strictly following the law in their dealings with civilians fleeing military operations in the area.  iraq launched an offensive on september 21 to dislodge islamic state from hawija, which lies west of the oil city of kirkuk and is one of two areas of the country still under the control of the militants. men from villages near hawija were detained by militias from the badr organisation, a pro iran, shi ite grouping that is playing a major role in baghdad s war against islamic state, and were taken to an unknown location, the hrw report said, based on interviews with villagers evacuated to a nearby refugee camp. the villagers told hrw they had seen militia fighters using their gun butts to beat the detained men. during their detention the fighters brought them food only once and only a small amount of water but did not let them use a bathroom.  human rights watch has documented that pmf groups, including units affiliated with the badr organization, have screened, detained, and tortured people during the military operations,  said the report.women were also detained briefly by iraqi security forces and were questioned about their male relatives  activities before being transported to the refugee camp, hrw said.  while iraqi forces do need all the help they can get, the government should not allow abusive forces to use this opportunity for even more abuse,  said sarah leah whitson, middle east director at human rights watch. the iraqi government was not immediately available to comment on the hrw report, but local badr commander kareem al mohammedawi denied that villagers  rights had been abused.  we are strictly ordering our fighters to abide by the law and avoid mistreating refugees fleeing the fighting. but when we suspect someone is a terrorist we normally arrest him and hand him over to the security forces,  he said.           hawija and a stretch of land along the syrian border are the last pieces of iraq still in the hands of islamic state, which overran about a third of the country in 2014.

" pakistan has rejected u.s. criticism of its efforts to fight terrorism, saying it should not be made a scapegoat for the failure of the u.s. military to win the war in afghanistan. u.s. president donald trump unveiled his policy for afghanistan on monday, stepping up the military campaign against taliban insurgents and singling out pakistan for harboring them. u.s. officials later warned that aid to pakistan might be cut and washington might downgrade nuclear armed pakistan s status as a major non nato ally, in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to america s longest running war. pakistan s powerful military chief, general qamar javed bajwa, met u.s. ambassador david hale on wednesday and told him pakistan was actively working for peace in afghanistan.  we have done a lot ... and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy,  bajwa was quoted in an army press statement as telling hale. pakistani foreign minister khawaja asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation over the u.s. criticism, reiterating pakistan s denial that it harbors militants.  they should not make pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in afghanistan,  asif said in an interview with geo tv late on tuesday.  a group of influential pakistani clerics including sami ul haq, who runs a islamic seminary where many senior afghan taliban studied, angrily condemned the united states.  america is the enemy of the muslim ummah (community),  haq told a press briefing along with other clerics who preach a jihadist doctrine.  the government of pakistan should quit the alliance for war against so called terrorism,  haq added.  the heavens will not fall if america gets angry with us.  pakistan has for years been battling homegrown islamist militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations. but critics say the pakistani military nurtures other islamist factions, including the afghan taliban, which are seen as useful to pakistan s core confrontation with old rival india. asif said pakistan had suffered great losses from islamist militancy   the government estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks, including 17,000 pakistanis killed   since pakistan joined the u.s.  war on terrorism  after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the united states. the relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade, especially after al qaeda leader osama bin laden was found and killed by u.s. special forces in pakistan in a 2011 raid.   last year, a u.s. drone strike killed then afghan taliban leader mullah akhtar mansour in southwestern pakistan, an attack islamabad protested as a violation of its sovereignty. pakistan has denied knowledge that either bin laden or mansour were in the country.

" the u.s. senate confirmed president donald trump’s pick to run the environmental protection agency on friday over the objections of democrats and environmentalists worried he will gut the agency, as the administration readies executive orders to ease regulation on drillers and miners. the installation of scott pruitt, who sued the agency he intends to lead more than a dozen times as oklahoma attorney general, reinforces expectations on both sides of the political divide that america will cede its position as a leader in the global fight on climate change. senators voted 52 46 to approve pruitt, who was to be sworn in later on friday afternoon at the white house. only one republican, senator susan collins of maine, voted against him. two democrats from energy producing states, joe manchin of west virginia and heidi heitkamp of north dakota, voted for his confirmation. “i have no doubt that scott will return the epa to its core objectives,” said republican senator james inhofe, also of oklahoma, adding the agency had been guilty of “federal overreach, unlawful rule making, and duplicative red tape,” during president barack obama’s presidency. the nomination of pruitt, who sued the epa more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil producing state and has doubted the science of climate change, upset many former and current agency employees. nearly 800 former epa staff urged the senate to reject pruitt in a letter this week, saying he had “shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws.” earlier this month, about 30 current employees at an epa regional office in chicago joined a protest against pruitt held by green groups. trump is likely to issue executive orders as soon as next week to reshape the epa, sources said. the republican president has promised to kill obama’s clean power plan, currently held up in the courts, that aims to slash carbon emissions from coal and natural gas fired power plants.  trump also wants to give states more authority over environmental issues by striking down federal regulations on drilling technologies and getting rid of an obama rule that sought to clarify the epa’s jurisdiction over streams and rivers. conservatives warmly welcomed pruitt’s confirmation.  “for far too long the epa has acted in an overzealous manner, ignoring the separation of powers, the role of states and the rights of property owners,” said nick loris, an economist at the heritage foundation.    democratic senator ben cardin, however, said he was concerned that if the administration does not enforce emissions cuts such as outlined in the clean power plan, it would increase u.s. pollution and harm the country’s leadership in international efforts to curb climate change.  opponents of pruitt also protested his ties to the energy industry. republicans have the majority in the senate, but democrats spoke through thursday night and friday morning on the senate floor, trying to extend debate on pruitt until later in february when 3,000 emails between him and energy companies will likely be revealed by a judge.  an oklahoma judge ruled this week that pruitt will have to turn over the emails between his office and energy companies by tuesday after a watchdog group, the center for media and democracy, sued for their release. the judge will review and perhaps hold back some of the emails before releasing them, a court clerk said. democratic senate leader chuck schumer told reporters that majority leader senator mitch mcconnell had moved to “strap blinders” on his fellow republicans by not waiting for the release of pruitt’s emails. environmentalists decried the approval. “if you don’t believe in climate science, you don’t belong at the epa,” said may boeve, the head of environmentalist group 350.org.

" democrats in congress, including party senate leader harry reid, asked the fbi to investigate concerns that the russian government may be attempting to undermine the u.s. presidential election through cyber attacks that could include tampering with voting results. “the prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the cold war,” reid said in a letter to fbi director james comey. reid’s letter, dated saturday, was first obtained by the new york times and shared on its website on monday. it was followed on tuesday by a letter from four democrats asking comey to assess whether campaign officials working for republican presidential candidate donald trump may be colluding with russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the democratic national committee and democratic congressional campaign committee in order to “interfere with the u.s. presidential election.” that letter was signed by representatives elijah cummings, john conyers, elliot engel and bennie thompson, each of whom serves as the top democrat on a different congressional committee. republicans control both the house of representatives and the senate. comey, speaking at a cyber security conference on tuesday, declined to give details about what the federal bureau of investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing. “we take very seriously any effort by any actor, ... especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information ... and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that is an election or something else,” he said. the two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting u.s. political databases, including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the russian government. kremlin officials have denied that. the fbi examined breaches in voter registration databases in illinois and arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it. reid said that the threat of russian government tampering in the election was “more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.” he also voiced concerns about possible russian government efforts to manipulate trump’s campaign ahead of the nov. 8 election, and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of russian president vladimir putin.

" puerto rico, struggling to make its debt payments, outlined an increase in its financing gap on monday, saying it now projects a $16.06 billion hole to fill, cumulatively, over the next five years, an increase of $2.1 billion from a september projection. the government development bank said in an updated fiscal and economic growth plan (fegp) released on monday that at the request of creditors, it had added a 10 year financing gap projection. it now estimates its debt financing hole to grow to $23.9 billion through 2025. facing over $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, puerto rico is trying to solve an economic crisis before it hits substantial debt payments in may and july. it has defaulted on some of its debt and is trying to persuade creditors to take concessions. the increases in the financing gaps occur, “even with the inclusion of economic growth and the implementation of all of the proposed measures in the fegp,” the government development bank (gdb) said in a separate statement. “since the release of the fegp in september, the fiscal and humanitarian crisis on the island has worsened, and the commonwealth is now facing even larger estimated financing gaps in both the near and long term. specifically, the general fund revenues included in the fegp have decreased from a previous estimate of $9.46 billion for fy (fiscal year) 2016 to $9.21 billion,” the gdb said. gdb said that as of jan. 10, it had $667 million of total net liquidity and $535 million in debt service payments during the next 6 months. “as previously indicated, we expect to sit with our creditors shortly and put forth a comprehensive restructuring proposal,” melba acosta, president of the gdb said in the statement. puerto rico, as a commonwealth of the united states with 3.5 million people, is not allowed to restructure its debt under existing bankruptcy law. it has sought unsuccessfully to convince the u.s. congress to vote for a change. however, in one development highlighted on monday by its representative to congress, pedro pierluisi, puerto rico’s hospitals will now receive the same basic reimbursement rate, known as the base rate, by the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms). this was included in the budget passed by the u.s. congress in december. “the congressional budget office (cbo) estimates that, as a result of this legislative change, puerto rico hospitals will receive $618 million more in federal reimbursement payments between 2016 and 2025, an average of over $60 million per year,” said a statement released by pierluisi on monday.

" cambodia hit back on thursday at u.s. criticism over its decision to expel a u.s. funded pro democracy group, accusing washington of political interference and describing american democracy as  bloody and brutal . prime minister hun sen, the strongman who has ruled cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti american line in the increasingly tense run up to a 2018 election. the u.s. state department criticized cambodia s decision to expel the national democratic institute (ndi) on wednesday and a statement from the u.s. embassy in phnom penh questioned whether cambodia was a democracy. in an open letter on thursday, the cambodian government asked whether the united states was  coming to cambodia to help or hinder the khmer people  and blamed it for contributing to the rise of the genocidal khmer rouge in the 1970s.   cambodians are well aware of what a democratic process means. you do not need to tell us what it is,  the letter said, describing u.s. style democracy as  bloody and brutal .  we wish to send a clear message again to the u.s. embassy that we defend our national sovereignty,  it added. tensions have risen anew in cambodia, with rights groups and the united nations expressing alarm and the opposition accusing hun sen of persecution ahead of next year s election. after the government s order to expel the ndi and a threat to shut a newspaper founded by an american journalist if it didn t pay back taxes immediately, the u.s. state department voiced concern at the government  curtailing freedom of the press and civil society s ability to operate . government supporters have threatened to protest at the u.s. embassy in phnom penh, the pro government  fresh news  web site reported on thursday.  the protests are likely to be in large scale against the u.s. embassy in phnom penh like in the 1960s because of the american interference in cambodia s sovereignty,  it said, citing an anonymous government source. the spillover from the u.s. war in neighboring vietnam in the 1960s and 70s helped bring to power the khmer rouge regime, whose rule was marked by the genocide of at least 1.8 million cambodians through starvation, torture, disease and execution. hun sen, the former khmer rouge commander who is one of china s closest regional allies, has warned of a possible return to war if his party doesn t win elections. in a statement on its website on wednesday the ndi called on cambodia to reconsider its decision to shut it down. the institute said it worked with all major parties and that its work was  strictly nonpartisan . ndi president kenneth wollack said the ndi has fulfilled all legal obligations for registration.  hun sen has also targeted local media in what rights groups say is a growing crackdown ahead of the election. cambodia s ministry of information on wednesday revoked the license of a local radio station for selling air time to the opposition cambodia national rescue party.  the station also rents out space to the u.s. government financed voice of america (voa) english news outlet.

" the approval rating for brazilian president michel temer s scandal plagued government has sunk further since new  corruption charges were brought against him, and 92 percent of brazilians do not trust him, a new poll published on thursday showed. the survey by pollster ibope said the number of people who consider temer s government  bad  or  terrible  rose to 77 percent from 70 percent in the previous survey carried out in july. the proportion of those who rate his government as  great  or  good  slipped to just 3 percent from 5 percent. only 6 percent of brazilians still trust temer, down from 10 percent, the poll said. the government s approval rating collapsed in july after temer was hit by a first corruption charge that was blocked by congress in august, which saved him from standing trial before the supreme court. but federal prosecutors filed new accusations against him of obstructing justice and being a member of a criminal organization in a corruption case involving the owners of the world s largest meatpacker jbs sa. they accused temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the president. the lower house of congress, which has the authority to decide whether a president should be put on trial, is expected to vote on the new charges in mid october at the earliest.  analysts expect the congress to again reject a supreme court trial for temer, putting him on course to serve out his term until the end of 2018. but the corruption debate will delay passage of his plan to overhaul brazil s costly pension system, a key measure to bring a gaping budget deficit under control.  he was already a very unpopular president proposing unpopular measures. now there is the perception that he, his cabinet and his ruling coalition are involved in a series of wrongdoings,  said lucas de arag o, partner at the brasilia based political risk consultancy arko advice. temer s ratings have fallen below the worst result of his predecessor dilma rousseff, whom he succeeded when she was impeached last year. rousseff and her workers party called her ouster a  coup  orchestrated by temer and his allies so they could shield themselves from corruption investigations. thursday s poll was commissioned by the national confederation of industry lobby and surveyed 2,000 people between sept. 15 20 across brazil. it has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

"the ceo of outdoor clothing giant patagonia is burnishing her anti-republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the  resistance  of president donald trump.patagonia ceo rose marcario recently attacked president trump for his statements about rolling back president obama s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as  national monuments. we have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  marcario said in a may article at huffpost.  i don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. in an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the trump administration for its efforts to scale back obama s unprecedented land grab. a president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  marcario said in an april 26 statement after trump announced his national monuments order.  an attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. in particular, the trump administration is preparing to revisit obama s order to create the bears ears national monument. in april, trump issued an executive order requiring the department of the interior to review obama s actions on national monuments. ordering interior secretary ray zinke to review obama s policies in april, president trump called obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. many state governments fully agree with trump s assessment and were furious when obama swooped in from washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.a poll of residents of utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.this is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. last year, the california-based company spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat donald trump and republicans.  breitbartpatagonia is an accredited and founding member of the fair labor association; its website is as much an educational tool about environmental and social responsibility filled with information on issues such as preservation of land in chile, labeling gmo products, and responsible sourcing as it is an online store. in a note launching the company s food division, patagonia provisions, company founder yvon chouinard restated the brand s central ethos:  we aim to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and perhaps most important, inspire solutions to the environmental crisis. and yet, despite these aspirations, four years ago internal audits turned up multiple instances of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation in patagonia s supply chain, according to cara chacon, the company s director of social and environmental responsibility, and thuy nguyen, the manager of supply chain social responsibility and special programs.",1
" the u.s. air force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the farnborough airshow this week. lockheed martin, boeing co, northrop grumman corp and raytheon co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time. u.s. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites   which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones   given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats. winston beauchamp, the u.s. air force deputy undersecretary for space, told reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites. the air force had previously looked at the options for follow on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of “hostile action or adverse conditions,” such as electromagnetic interference. beauchamp said senior pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to defense secretary ash carter for approval in the fall. once that decision is made, the air force hopes to begin the long awaited acquisition process to buy follow on satellites for the advanced extremely high frequency (aehf) system built by lockheed martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by lockheed under the space based infrared system (sbirs) program. work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn, beauchamp said. the u.s. air force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations. “we are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner,” beauchamp said. “in the past it was tacked on at the end. but we’d like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas.” ",0

" thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the white house, donald trump captured the 2016 republican presidential nomination on tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn. his eldest child, donald trump jr., announced the support of new york, their home state, during a roll call vote at the republican national convention, ensuring trump had the majority of delegates   1,237   needed to contest the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election against presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton. with three of the candidate’s other children at his side, the younger trump said: “it is my honor to be able to throw donald trump over the top in the delegate count tonight.” “congratulations, dad. we love you,” he said. trump’s democratic rival, clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: “donald trump just became the republican nominee. chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the oval office.” trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by u.s. senator ted cruz of texas with 475 delegates, ohio governor john kasich with 120 and u.s. senator marco rubio of florida with 114. three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates. after the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated indiana governor mike pence, 57, trump’s choice for his vice presidential running mate. speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, trump appeared on a video screen from new york promising to win the election in november, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard u.s. borders and “restore law and order” in the united states. the state by state vote to put trump’s name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four day convention, and after a speech by his wife, melania, drew accusations of plagiarism. a wealthy new york real estate developer best known to americans for his starring role in a long running tv show, “the apprentice,” where his catchphrase was “you’re fired,” the 70 year old trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office. on tuesday, under the headline “make america work again,” speakers at cleveland’s quicken loans basketball arena were meant to assail democratic president barack obama’s record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power. instead, speaker after speaker took aim at clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary americans and the inheritor of obama’s “oppressive” administration. a former secretary of state under obama, clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the democratic national convention next week in philadelphia. trump trails clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising republican primary season. trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday.  trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the republican nomination.  within weeks of announcing his candidacy at trump tower in new york on june 16, 2015, trump had taken a commanding lead in the republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on tuesday night   former florida governor jeb bush, part of a republican political dynasty. in a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white middle america, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment republicans like bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to “make america great again”. “we’ve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions,” donald trump jr. said in a convention speech. “we’re still americans. we’re still one country and we’re going to get it all back.” “i know we’ll get it back because i know my father,” trump jr. said. opponents brand trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of muslims and to build a border wall with mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. underscoring the problems trump has faced with u.s. allies abroad, german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said trump threatened u.s. and world security with his “politics of fear and isolation.” steinmeier told reuters in a written interview that he was concerned about what he called trump’s ambiguous vows to “make america strong again,” while simultaneously reducing its engagement overseas. party officials hope to use the convention to smooth out some of trump’s rough edges and present him as a job creator and a strong hand to combat security threats at home and abroad. u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, an early backer of trump, placed his name in nomination, calling him “a warrior and a winner.” two senior republicans, u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, spoke in favor of trump. republicans need trump to do well in the november election as they seek to preserve republican majorities in congress. security forces were on high alert in cleveland. but police said late on tuesday there had been only five arrests since the convention began on monday. wright state university, a public university near dayton, ohio, said on tuesday it had decided not to host the first u.s. presidential debate scheduled for sept. 26, citing mounting costs and security concerns. the event will now be held at hofstra university in new york. while in cleveland, trump ally chris christie said on tuesday that should trump win the presidency, he would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by obama  and could ask congress to pass legislation making it easier to dismiss public workers. christie, who is governor of new jersey and leads trump’s white house transition team, told dozens of donors the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if trump defeats clinton.

" thailand s military government on tuesday said it will not yet lift a ban on political activity, despite a general election scheduled for next year and growing pressure from political parties to lift it. the ban on political party gatherings has been in place since the military seized power in a 2014 coup but there have been growing calls from all political groups to end the ban. prime minister prayuth chan ocha cited persistent political divisions and mud slinging as reasons why the ban should stay.  we will not lift the ban today but don t be frustrated,  prayuth told reporters after a cabinet meeting on tuesday.  today we are still speaking evil. you must stop this so that everyone is at ease,  prayuth said, urging all sides to put aside their differences. earlier this month, prayuth said thailand would hold a general election in november 2018   the news was largely welcomed by investors in southeast asia s second biggest economy. there has been little opposition to junta rule since 2014, partly because authorities have arrested and jailed dozens of critics. the government had said that parties needed to wait until after the funeral of thailand s late king bhumibol adulyadej, who was cremated last week, for a decision on when normal political life will resume. tensions have been festering in thailand since 2006 when a coup removed then prime minister thaksin shinawatra. since then, the country has witnessed bouts of unrest including deadly street protests. thailand is divided broadly between those who align themselves with thaksin and his sister, former prime minister yingluck shinawatra, whose government was removed in the 2014 coup, and the elite in the capital bangkok. thaksin is credited by some as being the first thai prime minister to tap into the potential of the rural electorate. but he made many enemies among the elite who accuse him of corruption   which he denies. both thaksin and yingluck live abroad. yingluck fled thailand in august ahead of a verdict against her in a negligence trial for which she was later found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. thaksin fled to avoid a 2008 jail corruption sentence. politicians from major parties were upset about the decision not to lift the political activity ban on tuesday.  i want the junta to show some sincerity about the election by lifting the ban,  sunisa lertpakawat, a member of thaksin s puea thai party, told reuters.  we haven t got much time.

" the peruvian attorney general s office accused former president alejandro toledo on friday of taking bribes from brazilian construction firm camargo correa sa [pmorrc.ul] in exchange for a lucrative highway contract during his 2001 2006 term. an unnamed state s witness had helped uncover evidence that showed some $3.98 million in payments camargo made to toledo through offshore bank accounts controlled by one of toledo s associates, the attorney general s office said in an emailed statement. camargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. in lima, toledo s attorney, heriberto benitez, said toledo was innocent of the accusations.  i spoke with him yesterday, he said:  i didn t take money from anyone,  benitez said to reuters in a phone interview. toledo is already wanted in peru in connection with allegations that he took $20 million in bribes from odebrecht[odbes.ul], another privately owned brazilian builder, for help winning a contract for building a different section of the same highway. peruvian authorities are seeking toledo s extradition from the united states. his current whereabouts is unclear, but authorities said in february that he was in california, near his alma mater stanford university. following a judge s order in february that he should be held in pre trial detention, toledo said he would not return to peru. he has repeatedly described the probe as  political persecution . last year odebrecht admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes in peru to secure lucrative government contracts over a decade long period, spurring a far reaching investigation to determine which officials received them. odebrecht and camargo were at the center of brazil s biggest ever graft inquiry, known as  operation car wash.

" democrats in the senate made a concerted push on tuesday during a confirmation hearing for nominees to the securities and exchange commission to require corporations to disclose political contributions. senator charles schumer of new york threatened to vote against confirming the nominees, lisa fairfax and hester peirce, if they did not clearly state support for requiring corporations to make their political donations public. “the sec is certainly not responsible for patching that hole in our campaign finance system, but you can help prevent that hole from being ripped any wider,” schumer said. “shareholders remain in the dark as executives of public corporations funnel money into our political system with no transparency or accountability.” other democrats, including senator robert menendez of new jersey and senator jeff merkley of oregon, made similar comments. the securities regulator has faced mounting pressure to require contributions disclosure from corporations since the supreme court struck down strict limits on campaign finance in its 2010 citizens united decision.  menendez said 1.2 million people have written to the sec about the disclosure requirement.  budget legislation passed by the republican majority congress at the end of 2015 blocked the sec from creating a rule on political spending. peirce, a republican who is a senior fellow at the marcatus center at george mason university, noted the sec is charged with carrying out laws and said she would not undermine the budget legislation if she is confirmed.  fairfax, a democrat who is a law professor at george washington university, said she would uphold the budget law. she added, though, that she believes political spending could be material information to shareholders making investment decisions.  peirce and fairfax were nominated by president barack obama in october, and tuesday’s hearing was the first step in confirming the nominations.  republican senator richard shelby of alabama, the committee’s chairman, said he expected the nominations to come to the floor for a vote.  still, the confirmations could stretch on for a while given the political divide in congress and the debate about financial regulation in the presidential election.  the divide has made confirming nominees difficult. senator sherrod brown, a democrat from ohio, noted obama sent the committee 19 nominations to consider in the past 15 months and it approved only one.  meanwhile, the hearing turned to issues that are taking center stage in the presidential campaigns. senator elizabeth warren, a massachusetts democrat who advocates for financial regulation, pressed peirce about her public criticism of the dodd frank wall street reform law put in place after the financial crisis. many republicans consider the law a regulatory overreach, while some democrats view it as a way of preventing another crisis. “what you propose, from what i can tell in your writings, is less oversight of big banks, fewer efforts to reign them in, more chances for them to take on big risks to boost their profits and, if things go wrong, come crying to the government for another bailout,” warren said. “the question is whether someone should be put in charge of enforcing laws that they think are unnecessary or counterproductive.” peirce said she would implement the law as a commissioner. she added that she made her critiques as an academic and not a regulator. senator mike rounds, a republican from south dakota, brought up the issue of gun ownership and pushed fairfax about an amicus brief she signed that questioned walmart’s gun sales. fairfax said she was not sending “a signal about the underlying issue” but signed the brief to say companies must communicate corporate policies to investors.

" a member of the mormon tabernacle choir has resigned over its plan to sing at the inauguration of president elect donald trump, and more than 22,000 people have signed a petition opposing the choir’s participation. jan chamberlin resigned after five years with the choir, which originates from utah, over the jan. 20 ceremony, saying it “will appear that (the) choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man.” with three weeks to go before trump is sworn in, teen classical singer jackie evancho is the only celebrity to have unequivocally embraced her role in an inauguration ceremony marked by soul searching by larger invited groups, and fan backlash. the 1960s pop group, the beach boys, is considering an invitation to perform but has yet to make a final decision, a spokesman for the band said on friday. “i simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. i could never look myself in the face again,” chamberlin wrote in a resignation letter that she posted on facebook on thursday. a separate petition on change.org started by randall thacker, a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints, had gathered more than 22,000 signatures on friday. the petition says the participation of the tabernacle choir in trump’s inauguration does not reflect the church’s values and would harm its worldwide image. the church says taking part in the inauguration is voluntary, and notes that the tabernacle choir, which hails from salt lake city, utah, has sung at such celebrations for five previous republican presidents. church spokesman eric hawkins said on friday public response to the inauguration plans “has been mixed, with people expressing both opposition and support. the choir’s participation... is not an implied support of party affiliations or politics. it is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power.”  some dancers in the radio city rockettes were also unhappy at performing. “we do a lot of events, but there have been no events that could cause trauma. and doing this would cause trauma for some people,” one rockettes dancer said this week, speaking anonymously with marie claire magazine. italian tenor andrea bocelli suffered a fan backlash on social media after reports that he was planning to sing for trump. bocelli and country singer garth brooks both backed out of performing at the inauguration. organizers have denied they are struggling to recruit big names for the ceremony. “this is not woodstock,” trump aide boris epshteyn told cnn this week. “it’s not about celebrities. as donald trump tweeted himself, it’s about the people.” ",0

" president donald trump said on friday he was elevating the status of the pentagon’s u.s. cyber command to help spur development of cyber weapons to deter attacks and punish intruders. in a statement, trump said the unit would be ranked at the level of unified combatant command focused on cyberspace operations. cyber command’s elevation reflects a push to strengthen u.s. capabilities to interfere with the military programs of adversaries such as north korea’s nuclear and missile development and islamic state’s ability to recruit, inspire and direct attacks, three u.s. intelligence officials said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity. cyber command had been subordinate to the u.s. strategic command, which is also responsible for military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense. once elevated, cyber command would have the same status as u.s. strategic command and eight other unified commands that control u.s. military forces and are composed of personnel from multiple branches of the armed services.  the pentagon did not specify how long the elevation process would take. current and former officials said a leading candidate to head u.s. cyber command was army lt. gen. william mayville, currently director of the pentagon’s joint staff. trump also said the defense secretary was also considering separating the u.s. cyber command from the national security agency (nsa). cyber command’s mission is to shut down and, when ordered, counter cyber attacks. the nsa’s role is to gather intelligence and generally favors monitoring enemies’ cyber activities. republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham, both strong voices on security matters, praised the move and said it would boost the command’s abilities.  still, mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said more steps were needed to meet the nation’s cyber security challenges. “we must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats. we must also develop an integrated, whole of government approach to protect and defend the united states from cyberattacks,” he said in a statement. the new combatant command will improve u.s. capabilities to punish foreign cyberattacks and discourage attempts to disrupt critical u.s. infrastructure such as financial networks, electric grids, and medical systems. it will establish a cyber version of the nuclear doctrine of “mutual assured destruction” between the united states and the former soviet union, the three u.s. officials said the u.s. is more vulnerable to cyber intrusions than its most capable adversaries, including china, russia, and north korea, because its economy is more dependent on the internet, two of the officials said. as other nations improve their communications networks, their vulnerability will grow, they added.

" the european union should investigate malta s anti money laundering system, eu lawmakers said on tuesday in response to the murder of a maltese journalist who reported widely on financial and political corruption. daphne caruana galizia, who was blown up by a car bomb last week, had published leaked documents on alleged money laundering cases involving top maltese officials. eu parliamentarians said malta now needed to show it was clean.  the maltese government has failed to take serious action against high level cases of money laundering in its country , green members of the european parliament (meps) eva joly and sven giegold said in a joint statement.  we want a serious investigation by the european commission on malta s respect of the european rules against money laundering.   eu justice commissioner vera jourova said in a letter to green meps dated oct. 23 that  based on the information available so far, there appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach of union law pertaining to the prevention of money laundering  in malta. but she added that the commission had requested more information from malta on cases of alleged money laundering involving keith allen schembri, the chief of staff of prime minister joseph muscat. schembri has denied the allegations. prime minister joseph muscat told reuters in an interview last week that the island s  financial services sector is as transparent, solid and compliant as any other european jurisdiction.  ahead of a debate on the  protection of journalists and the defense of media freedom in malta , the european parliament held a minute s silence, at a session in strasbourg attended by caruana galizia s widower and children.  parliament president antonio tajani said the parliament s press room would be named after the murdered reporter. he added that europol, the eu law enforcement agency, should help investigate caruana galizia s murder  as part of an international investigation where all police forces can contribute to find the culprits . the maltese government has sought assistance from the u.s. federal bureau of investigation and from dutch experts to help resolve the case.  the head of the italian parliament s anti mafia committee urged malta to toughen laws to combat organized crime. italian investigators have traced criminal proceeds to companies set up in malta to launder money by the southern italian mafia groups. anti mafia committee head rosy bindi said during a visit to the island that malta had to close legal loopholes.  those who order assassinations are often the ones who fear that loopholes will be closed,  she said.

" the son in law of ousted pakistani premier nawaz sharif was arrested at islamabad airport on monday by pakistan s anti corruption body on his return from london, officials said, a rare instance of a powerful pakistani politician being detained. muhammad safdar, a lawmaker married to sharif s daughter and heir apparent maryam, was arrested after he failed to appear at previous national accountability bureau (nab) court hearings about corruption allegations stemming from a probe into the sharif family wealth. the sharifs have denied any wrongdoing and have labeled the corruption proceedings against them as politically motivated. two of nawaz s sons are also due to appear before the nab court, along with finance minister ishaq dar. nawaz was disqualified by the supreme court in july for not declaring a source of income that he disputes receiving. pakistan s top court also ordered a wide ranging nab investigation and trial into sharif family members.  the supreme court specified that the trial be concluded within six months by nab, which has in the past been derided as toothless because rich and powerful politicians were seldom convicted. safdar, who was arrested soon after midnight, was expected to be released after his nab court appearance with maryam this morning.  television footage showed some supporters from the ruling pakistan muslim league nawaz (pml n) trying to stop the car from leaving the airport, including some who lay down in front of it. a senior pml n official urged them to give way. khawaja saad rafique, a minister in the pml n cabinet, said on twitter no resistance was made to safdar s arrest, even though the party had  serious reservations  about the judicial process. sharif s disqualification stems from the panama papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the british virgin islands and used them to buy properties in london. the supreme court initially declined to dismiss nawaz but ordered an investigation into his family s wealth. after the probe it disqualified him and ordered a nab investigation and trial into the family. some senior pml n officials, including maryam, have hinted that elements of pakistan s powerful military had a hidden hand in the supreme court disqualification that forced nawaz to resign. the army denied playing a role. the case against the sharifs has gripped pakistan, with analysts expecting the negative newsflow from the hearings to hurt pml n in the run up to the next general elections, likely in mid 2018.

" under growing pressure from thailand s military government, and their own religious bodies, buddhist monks have launched a fresh round of reforms in recent weeks to clean up temples and overhaul a religion stalked by scandal. buddhism, thailand s dominant religion, is followed by more than 90 percent of the population.  but its image has suffered over sex scandals involving monks and allegations of money laundering by a former abbot of thailand s biggest temple. the scandals have prompted calls for tighter checks on the finances of thousands of temples across the country that are among thailand s popular tourist attractions. since september, senior monks have issued orders to enforce stronger discipline for thailand s more than 300,000 monks and some 40,000 temples. the orders come at a sensitive time as thailand prepares to cremate the late king bhumibol adulyadej next week and the formal coronation of his only son, king maha vajiralongkorn, likely taking place at the end of the year. the written instructions, seen by reuters, tell monks to stop asking for donations and temples to stop selling holy objects inside temple grounds. the instructions appear to be aimed at making temple finances more transparent and to counter criticism about the commercialization of religion in the southeast asian nation. other orders instruct senior monks to tightly control  inappropriate use of social media  by monks to prevent   criticism from the public.   the orders were endorsed by the sangha supreme council, the body that governs buddhist monks in thailand and performs a similar role to the roman catholic church s college of cardinals.  these rules already existed for monks but their implementation may have been lax,  phra phrom moli, a member of the sangha supreme council told reuters. many thais believe generous donations to temples can bring  good karma   the principle that good deeds will lead to a good future    something temples and monks have exploited, groups lobbying for reform say.   phra phrom moli welcomed the new orders.   we must examine ourselves, listen to the people and see what is and is not appropriate for the sake of the public s faith in the religion,  he said. one order given in september by a group of temples in thailand s northeast region asked monks to police each other and report any behavior that might go against buddhist teachings.  please take care of any monks who are not practicing discipline,  the order read. the junta has been trying to reform thai buddhism since it came to power in a 2014 coup.   last month, it reinstated a former senior police official, pongporn pramsaneh, as head of the national buddhism office, who soon afterward asked police to investigate temples where state funds were allegedly misappropriated. reuters was unable to reach pongporn for comment. police say they are focusing on 35 temples and 29 individuals, including five abbots and a former buddhism chief, who were allegedly involved in misappropriating funds. all five abbots have been formally charged for abusing state authority and colluding to do wrong, among other charges. the government allocated 5.32 billion baht($160.77 million)to support buddhism last year, 4.67 billion baht of which was earmarked for temples and monks across the country.  some analysts see the latest reform push as part of a power tussle between monks and the state ahead of the royal transition.  what the monkhood is doing is tightening control for the sake of their own legitimacy,  somrit luechai a buddhism scholar somrit luechai told reuters. thai buddhism also needs to make itself relevant again, he added.  by failing to adapt and find new ways to make people understand the teachings of the buddha ... they are gradually loosing relevance for new generations of thais,  somrit said. sulak sivaraksa, a pre eminent buddhist scholar, agrees. for centuries, buddhist temples were centers of education in thailand but sulak said theoretical teachings were no longer enough.  the education of monks needed modernization,  sulak told reuters.  the existing system is creating monks that do not fully understand the real world.

" the city of cleveland and the american civil liberties union on friday settled a federal lawsuit over free speech limits outside the republican national convention next month, setting the stage for lively demonstrations during donald trump’s big moment. the city had been seeking a restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the quicken loans arena, site of the convention, where free speech and mobility would be limited. that prompted an aclu lawsuit on behalf of three protest groups that argued the so called event zone was too large and the security regulations too strict. details of the new event zone and protest rules were not immediately available. “today, counsel advised me that the case is settled and that they will execute a settlement agreement expeditiously,” u.s. district judge dan aaron polster said in a statement. another judge on thursday had struck down cleveland’s plan for placing limits on protests, issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of the aclu and referring the case to polster for mediation. trump is expected to become the republican party’s official nominee for president at the july 18 21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations with some resulting in clashes between the candidate’s supporters and opponents. the plaintiffs in the cleveland lawsuit are citizens for trump, a texas based group that supports the wealthy businessman’s campaign; organize ohio, a liberal activist group; and northeast ohio coalition for the homeless, a charitable organization. citizens for trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while organize ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the aclu said.

" slovenia, birth country of u.s. first lady melania trump, expects revenues from foreign tourists to jump by about 9 percent this year and by at least 5 percent in 2018, economy minister zdravko pocivalsek said on tuesday. 2017 will be the fourth record year in a row for slovenian tourism after revenues from foreign tourists reached some 2.3 billion euros ($2.71 billion) last year, pocivalsek told a news conference. tourism in slovenia rose strongly because of  a general increase of tourism in europe and a successful promotion of slovenia as a safe country. officials say it also got something of a boost from melania trump having been born in the city of sevnica in southeastern slovenia before becoming a fashion model and moving to the united states.   we received a lot of attention from (international) journalists because of the u.s. first lady and we managed to present slovenia as an attractive, green country,  maja pak, head of the slovenian tourist organisation, told the same news conference. about 60 percent of slovenia is covered by forests while the country has some resorts on the adriatic sea as well as a number of alpine and spa tourist resorts.  pocivalsek also said slovenia plans to gradually privative all tourist accommodation infrastructure which should further improve tourism business. at present about 40 percent of hotels in slovenia are in state hands.  i want a well considered privatization ... which will be in favor of the state and the companies that are being sold,  pocivalsek said. in the first 10 months of 2017 the number of foreign tourists jumped by almost 17 percent year on year, the statistics office said last month.  in the first nine months of the year, the latest data available, the number of tourists from the united states rose by 23.4 percent, it added.  according to the government s tourism strategy the revenues from foreign tourists should rise to at least 3.7 billion euros per year by the end of 2021.

" democrat hillary clinton’s lead over republican rival donald trump has slipped by about five percentage points since mid june, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday, bringing the race for the white house to within nine points.  the poll showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters supported former secretary of state clinton while 35.5 percent backed businessman trump. that compares with 46.6 percent support for clinton and 32.3 percent for trump on june 12, a date that marked her widest lead for the month. trump has focused much of his energy in recent days on the mass shooting in orlando, florida by a u.s. born gunman pledging allegiance to islamic state militant group. trump vowed to ban people from entering the united states from countries with links to terrorism against america or its allies. hardline national security proposals have help trump win increased support from voters in the past, including after the shootings in san bernardino, california and paris late last year. clinton responded to the orlando attack by calling for increased intelligence gathering and air strikes on islamic state forces, while warning against demonizing american muslims. she has also criticized trump’s positions on foreign policy and the economy, saying a trump presidency would be a “disaster”.  the june 17 21 poll of 1,100 likely voters has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.

" u.s. health insurer anthem inc (antm.n) said on monday it will no longer offer obamacare plans in nevada’s state exchange and will stop offering the plans in nearly half of georgia’s counties next year. the moves come after republican senators last month failed to repeal and replace obamacare, former president barack obama’s signature healthcare reform law, creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million americans will be funded and managed in 2018. hundreds of u.s. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. nevada had said in june that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges. anthem’s decision to leave the state entirely does not increase the number of “bare counties” in the state, nevada insurance commissioner barbara richardson said in a statement. the insurer will still offer “catastrophic plans,” which can be purchased outside the state’s exchange and are only available to consumers under 30 years old or with a low income. anthem also said it will only offer obamacare plans in 85 of georgia’s 159 counties. it said the counties it will continue to offer the plans in are mostly rural counties that would otherwise not have health insurance coverage for their residents.  it said these changes do not impact anthem’s medicare advantage, medicaid or employer based plans in either state.   the company said last week that it will pull out of 16 of 19 pricing regions in california in 2018 where it offered obamacare options this year.  anthem blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over whether the trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down.  u.s. president donald trump last week threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower income americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, president barack obama, failed in congress.  trump has repeatedly urged republican lawmakers to keep working to undo obama’s affordable care act.

"9-11 is a distant memory for liberals george washington university has hired a former islamic extremist to work at its center on homeland security   a man who once denounced the united states and made threats against the creators of the tv series  south park  for depicting the prophet muhammad in a bear suit.while reformed extremists have worked at universities in europe to help fight terrorism, this is believed to be a first in the united states.jesse morton, who was known as younus abdullah muhammad when he was a recruiter for the al-qaeda, brings a  unique perspective  to counter-terrorism work, said seamus hughes, deputy director of the program on extremism at george washington university s center for cyber & homeland security .watch younus abdullah muhammad here:during his days as an extremist, morton earned a master s degree in international affairs from columbia university.hughes said before making the hiring decision, he discussed morton with the fbi, leaders in the security community and the lawyers that prosecuted morton.he said he s sure morton is completely reformed from the days he served time in federal prison after inciting people to join a terrorist organization. i trust him,  he said.  we did our due diligence. nadia oweidat, a fellow at the think tank new america who s interviewed dozens of former extremists, said she doesn t doubt morton s sincerity. people go through phases. they evolve and are finally able to see the light,  she said.she doesn t think morton made up his de-radicalization to get a shorter prison sentence. when an extremist defects, they risk being completely targeted by their community   it s like saying you re gay publicly,  she said.  there are life-altering consequences and you don t approach it lightly. she said other organizations should also recruit former extremists in the hopes of preventing future massacres such as the san bernardino shooting or the november terror attack in paris, both committed by radicalized islamists.   cnn",1
" poland should defend its national identity and interests at a time when the european union is debating its own future, the country s new prime minister mateusz morawiecki told parliament on tuesday. warsaw has grown increasingly isolated in the european union since the law and justice party (pis) won power two years ago. critics say its efforts to assert control over the courts and public media have subverted democratic standards. morawiecki, 49, was named prime minister last week in a government reshuffle, replacing beata szydlo as the pis party gears up for elections over the next three years. morawiecki said warsaw s economic policy   based on generous public spending and a growing focus on domestic capital instead of foreign investment   should not change. echoing the eurosceptic pis s calls for more say in brussels  policy making for national governments, morawiecki said polish  sovereignty and tradition should be used in defending national interests .  the future of the european project is being decided now,  morawiecki told deputies.  poland fits perfectly into the european puzzle, but it cannot be forced in incorrectly. by doing so, you will destroy both the puzzle and the piece,  the former bank executive said. britain s decision to leave the bloc has also meant that poland lost an important ally in its calls to curb further eu integration, while the election of french president emmanuel macron has fanned new fears in warsaw of losing influence. morawiecki said poland would oppose the idea of a multi speed europe, which macron supports but which countries in the eu s east fear would mean deeper cooperation in the west at the expense of the bloc s single market.  we don t want further divisions ... we oppose splitting of europe between those are who better and those who are inferior.  morawiecki said he  wholeheartedly  supported pis s overhaul of the judiciary, approved by the lower house of parliament on friday despite the european union s reservations. eu officials say the legislation, which gives lawmakers de facto control over the selection of judges, will threaten the impartiality of the courts. addressing economic policy, morawiecki said poland should strive to find a  golden middle  between a lean state  which abandons its citizens and a bureaucracy. we don t want either.   our national sovereignty and tradition are an advantage in efforts to modernise poland, not a burden, as some are trying to tell us,  he said. pis  has gained in popularity since becoming the first in post communist poland to govern without a coalition. it has benefited from fast economic growth, record low unemployment, generous welfare and an increased emphasis on traditional catholic values in public life. however, private investment remains weak, with economists saying companies are reluctant to spend amid uncertainty over taxation and the government s influence over the economy. morawiecki, who as finance minister was also responsible for economic development policy before his appointment as prime minister, has long called for a greater role for domestic capital in the economy. parliament is due to hold a vote of confidence on morawiecki and his cabinet overnight.

" russian aggression is to blame for violence in eastern ukraine, where people are dying in what should be seen as a “hot war” rather than a “frozen conflict”, the u.s. special envoy to the ukraine peace talks said on a visit to ukraine on sunday. kurt volker, a former u.s. ambassador to nato, was appointed to his current role on july 7 to help resolve the conflict between ukrainian troops and pro russian separatists, which has  killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.   washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to better relations with russia.  on a visit to the ukrainian held town of kramatorsk, 690 km (430 miles) southeast of kiev, volker said he would prepare a set of recommendations on how washington can better engage with the peace process. “this is not a frozen conflict, this is a hot war, and it’s an immediate crisis that we all need to address as quickly as possible,” he said. relations between ukraine and russia went into freefall after moscow’s 2014 annexation of crimea and the subsequent outbreak of a pro russian insurgency in the eastern donbass region. ukraine accuses russian of sending in its own soldiers and military equipment, which moscow denies. volker replied in the affirmative when asked whether he saw the conflict as being as the result of russian aggression rather than internal ukrainian factors. “we’ve seen what’s happened, we understand the way this conflict has begun, we understand the way it is being managed today, and that’s why it’s important that the united states become more engaged.” fighting in the donbass region has killed 12 people in a particularly bloody week, prompting germany and france to urge immediate progress in implementing ceasefire agreements signed in belarus in 2015 that are regularly flouted.  leaders of france, germany, ukraine and russia will speak by phone on monday to discuss the conflict.  u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said in early july that russia must make the first move to bring peace to ukraine, which president petro poroshenko called a powerful signal of washington’s backing. a career diplomat, volker is a former aide to republican senator john mccain, a russia hawk who wants the united states to supply lethal weapons to ukraine, a move the previous administration under barack obama shied away from.

" israeli authorities approved on wednesday a major expansion of a jewish settler enclave in the heart of a palestinian neighborhood of east jerusalem, issuing building permits  for 176 new housing units. the construction, which a jerusalem municipal spokeswoman said was approved by the city s planning committee, was swiftly condemned by the palestinians as a violation of international law. construction of the new units will nearly triple the number of settler homes in the nof zion settlement, which currently has 91 dwellings and is surrounded by palestinian houses in the jabel al mukaber neighborhood. the area is located in territory that israel captured and annexed in a 1967 middle east war and which palestinians seek as part of a state they want to establish in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip, with east jerusalem as its capital.  we are unifying jerusalem through actions on the ground,  jerusalem mayor nir barkat said in a statement about the settlement s expansion. israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital has not won international recognition, and many countries regard the settlements it has built on occupied land as illegal and obstacles to any future land for peace deal. israel disputes this. wasel abu yousif, a member of the palestine liberation organization, called the construction plans in jabel al mukaber  a challenge to all the calls by the international community  to halt settlement building. last week, israel announced approval for the construction of several hundred additional homes for settlers in the west bank, drawing condemnation from palestinians and the european union. israeli palestinian peace talks have not been held since 2014, with settlement building one of the issues that led to their collapse. some 500,000 israelis live in the west bank and east jerusalem, areas that are home to more than 2.6 million palestinians.

"every day we learn of a new security breach or criminal act by hillary, her closest staff members or her campaign. every american, regardless of party affiliation should be ashamed to have such a reckless, criminal running for the highest office in our nation. an unnamed  senior aide  to then-secretary of state hillary clinton left classified information unsecured and unattended in a hotel room during a 2010 trip to china, one of several overseas lapses by clinton s inner circle, fox news has learned.confirmation of the alarming violation comes as clinton herself is under a renewed fbi probe for mishandling sensitive information on a private server and her longtime senior aide, huma abedin, also faces scrutiny as part of the investigation. it was not known which of clinton s aides left the information exposed. in may 2010, secretary clinton was on official travel in beijing, china, accompanied by senior staff. upon secretary clinton s departure, a routine security sweep by diplomatic security agents identified classified documents in a staff member s suite,  state department spokesman john kirby told fox news in a statement, issued several weeks after a freedom of information act request was filed with the agency.diplomatic security, which protects the secretary of state in the u.s. and abroad, as well as high-ranking foreign dignitaries and officials visiting the united states, wrote up the incident on a form 117, while the marine security guards filed a separate formal report, the source said.the information came to light when the fbi was investigating whether clinton or her staff violated the us espionage act by mishandling classified and top secret information.house permanent select committee on intelligence chairman devin nunes, r-calif., citing a whistleblower who separately came to him with an allegation it was clinton who left the material out, wrote to the fbi director on monday asking for more information. i  understand that former secretary clinton left classified documents in her hotel room in china and that u.s. marine corps security officials filed a report related to the possible compromise of the documents,  nunes wrote to fbi director james comey.additionally, nunes said an email released in response to a foia request described abedin asking another staffer to remove  burnstuff  abedin had left in a car during a trip to india.kirby told fox news that incident may not have involved classified material. this email exchange does not show that classified information was left in a motorcade car,  kirby said of that incident.  sensitive but unclassified material is routinely disposed of in burn bags. as the regulations state, sensitive but unclassified (sbu) and personally identifiable information (pii) documents are often burned. so it s not accurate that any reference to a document going to a burn bag is a document that includes classified material. as for the china incident, kirby insisted that clinton had nothing to do with the matter. to be clear   this was not secretary clinton s hotel room and no citation whatsoever was given to secretary clinton, nor were any reports written about secretary clinton s conduct,  kirby said in the statement.at the time of the security sweep, the suite was still inside of a diplomatic security-controlled area, kirby said, and under the direct control of a diplomatic security agent posted outside the room. ultimately, diplomatic security concluded that classified information had been improperly secured, but that the evidence did not support assigning culpability to any individual. furthermore, the diplomatic security investigation concluded that due to the fact that the documents were found within a diplomatic security controlled area, the likelihood that the information was compromised was remote. leaving out classified or top secret information is a serious offense, a former state department staffer told foxnews.com. diplomatic security and the marine security guard takes exposure of classified information very seriously,  said jessica vaughan, director of policy research at the center for immigration studies.  you can lose your security clearance if you re caught more than once, and that means you might lose your job. it s a big deal.    fox news",1

" u.s. treasury counselor antonio weiss said on thursday that without a proper restructuring regime, puerto rico will default and litigation will intensify, as he pushed congress to act with legislation to help the island fix its crisis. weiss, speaking to the house natural resources committee in a hearing about the island’s fiscal crisis, outlined the scale of the problems the u.s. territory faces. “as the cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another lost decade, this one more damaging than the last,” weiss said. a legislative solution for puerto rico, battling with $70 billion debt, may be edging closer. legislation to find a fix for the island is expected to be drawn up following two congressional hearings on thursday   one in front of the house natural resources committee at which weiss was the sole witness. house speaker paul ryan has said he wants the republican led house to develop a response to puerto rico’s fiscal crisis during the first quarter of 2016, and republicans plan to bring a bill addressing the crisis to the house floor by the end of march. puerto rico wants access to a bankruptcy like mechanism to reduce debt   a view backed by president barack obama’s administration and some congressional democrats. but majority republicans have not supported efforts to extend bankruptcy protection to the island, a strategy which could be detrimental to some creditors, and are keen to put puerto rico under strict fiscal oversight.  weiss, in questioning, said that treasury’s restructuring proposal was not envisioning the chapter 9 bankruptcy law u.s. states can access for their public agencies, but legislation “customized to the unique conditions that face puerto rico.”  weiss said his team will have to work to convince island leaders of the need for an oversight board for the island. “i think the legislature doesn’t fully understand what this oversight authority would consist of,” he said.  puerto rico, with a 45 percent poverty rate, has been in recession for nearly a decade and is losing population to the mainland. it is suffering from a huge debt buildup and has already defaulted on some borrowings.  “there is fear of the future,” said weiss. “puerto ricans are leaving and are joining us on the mainland where they find access to jobs, a future for their children, better healthcare.”  weiss said that a failure to protect pension payments would “irreparably harm retirees” and add greater stress to puerto rico’s economy.  “we are deeply concerned about the pensions in puerto rico,” he said.  the treasury late last year envisioned giving puerto rico’s pensioners stronger legal protection than holders of its constitutionally backed bonds if it went bankrupt, according to a draft of a proposed plan seen by reuters. a separate hearing before a subcommittee of the house committee on financial services focused on the impact to investors in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. mark zandi, chief economist at moody’s analytics, said without a broad restructuring framework to include more of the debt than a chapter 9 framework would envision, the issue would not be solved and “we will be back here again.”  legislation for puerto rico could potentially be written as a stand alone law, which carries the risk of having little momentum to approve it, or attached to a bill related to the federal aviation administration (faa), a congressional source previously said.  an faa authorization bill which authorizes funding for the agency could come up for a vote in the house of representatives as early as next month.        however, a legislative solution may be hard to achieve given the differing views and acrimonious relationship between republicans, which control congress, and democrats.  tom mcclintock, a republican of california, said instead of increasing regulation, puerto rico needs less red tape, less tax burden and could be turned into a “hong kong of the caribbean.”     however, representative raul labrador of idaho said he appreciated that weiss was “trying to find a solution.” “we don’t agree on every one of your solutions but i can tell that the administration is acting in good faith in finding a solution to the problem,” labrador said.

" the u.s. labor department on friday defended its authority to use salary levels to decide who was eligible for overtime pay but distanced itself from an obama administration rule that greatly expanded the number of qualifying workers. under u.s. president donald trump, the labor department has continued to fight a challenge to an obama administration era rule to raise the pay threshold for overtime eligibility. but it has not endorsed the former administration’s move to nearly double that threshold, an increase strongly opposed by business groups.  the labor department told a federal appeals court on friday it had the power to use salaries to set thresholds for mandatory overtime pay, without advocating for the $47,500 maximum salary level set by the department under obama. the labor department is challenging a november decision from a federal judge in texas that blocked the obama rule, a decision that the department said could prevent it from setting a new threshold below that set by the obama administration.  the obama rule was expected to extend overtime pay eligibility to more than 4 million salaried workers. nevada and 20 other states sued last year to block the rule. business groups criticized the increase as too drastic and costly, potentially forcing employers to convert salaried workers to hourly wages. trump’s labor secretary r. alexander acosta said during his confirmation hearing in march that the correct threshold might be around $33,000. the labor department took initial steps earlier this week to begin developing a new threshold. in its friday brief to the new orleans based 5th u.s circuit court of appeals, the labor department made it clear it did not support the salary threshold developed under obama. but the department told the court it was “reluctant” to move forward with the rulemaking necessary to set a new threshold as long as its authority was in question. nevada and the other states have said that the use of a salary threshold to determine overtime eligibility has been controversial for decades, but appeals courts allowed it because it had been set low enough to exempt management workers.  but the obama administration rule is far more drastic, the states said, expanding overtime pay to tens of thousands of state employees. senator patty murray, a washington state democrat, criticized the labor department’s handling of the appeal, saying in a statement that the administration “appears to be preparing to roll back overtime protections for millions of workers.” ",0

" a former finance co chair of chris christie’s presidential campaign on sunday slammed christie’s recent endorsement of donald trump, according to nbc, calling for the new jersey governor’s supporters to reject the republican front runner.  “chris christie’s endorsement of donald trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. donald trump is unfit to be president,” meg whitman, chief executive officer of hewlett packard, said in a statement reported by nbc’s “meet the press” program. christie, appearing on abc’s “this week” program, responded by describing whitman “a great friend” with a different political opinion. “and that’s ok. that’s what makes this country great is that people can have differences of political opinion,” he said.   just days before the super tuesday nominating contests, christie on friday became the most prominent mainstream republican to get behind the billionaire republican front runner and former reality tv star, declaring trump to have the best chance of defeating democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. but whitman’s statement said the new jersey governor made his statement despite his own public misgivings about a trump presidency. “trump would take america on a dangerous journey. christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly,” whitman said. trump’s unorthodox candidacy has shaken the republican party and has drawn increasingly vehement criticism from his rivals. but a growing number of senior republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in november. christie, who withdrew his own white house bid earlier this month, denied that he reversed course on trump after promising new hampshire union leader newspaper publisher joe mcquaid that he would not endorse him after the billionaire won the state’s feb. 9 primary election. “it’s just not true. he called me two days after the primary and said, i was just told that you’re about to endorse donald trump. and i said to him, that’s absolutely untrue. i’m not about to endorse anybody,” christie told abc.

" a prominent strategist for kenya s opposition who has strongly criticized president uhuru kenyatta and called for some parts of the country to secede was released on monday after being briefly detained on suspicion of inciting violence. kenya s public prosecutor said on twitter that david ndii had been released on police bond and that  appropriate actions  would be taken after investigations are completed.  police had earlier said ndii, an economist and anti corruption campaigner who was arrested on sunday in the coastal town of diani, was  under interrogation regarding ... the offence of incitement to violence . opposition leader raila odinga condemned the arrest, saying on monday:  he has committed no crime. (this is) designed to intimidate and fragment the people of kenya.  pro democracy groups said ndii s arrest raised concerns about freedom of expression.   ndii has been at the forefront of articulating the problems with the way the country is run,  said gladwell otieno, executive director of africa centre for open governance (africog) in nairobi.      ndii is an outspoken critic of kenyatta, who was sworn in for a second presidential term last week after a prolonged elections season that has disrupted the economy and spurred protests that killed more than 60 people.  a senior policy adviser to the opposition national super alliance (nasa), he has called since a disputed august election that was voided by the supreme court for western and coastal areas that are opposition strongholds to declare independence.   odinga, who boycotted a repeat poll in october saying the election commission had failed to carry out sufficient reforms, has said his preference is for kenya to remain united. kenyatta won the re run election with 98 percent of the vote but the country, a western ally in a volatile region, remains deeply divided after months of bitter campaigning and sporadic violent clashes. salim lone, an odinga adviser, said ndii was helping to organize the  swearing in  of odinga by a people s assembly on dec. 12, kenya s independence day, a plan that has raised the prospect of further confrontations with security forces. ndii s wife judith mwende gatabaki told journalists on monday that he was arrested by men who identified themselves as members of the  flying squad    a police unit that is part of the criminal investigation directorate.  she said they searched the couple s hotel room before taking him away and that she had been unable to reach her husband since.     we came here to attend a wedding. there was nothing political about it and my husband is not a criminal,  gatabaki  said.

" the trump administration is preparing to relax obama era rules on drone strikes and commando raids, paving the way for more frequent operations against islamic state and other militant groups, the new york times reported on thursday, citing officials familiar with the internal deliberations. president donald trump’s advisers have proposed relaxing a rule that generally limits drone strikes and raids to high level militants deemed to pose a “continuing and imminent threat” to americans, the times said. the rule would be expanded to include foot soldiers, it said. the advisers also want to eliminate a rule that drone strikes and raids by the military and the central intelligence agency undergo high level vetting, according to the times. officials have agreed they should keep in place a requirement of “near certainty” that no civilian bystanders will be killed, the newspaper said. a cabinet level committee approved the proposed rules on sept. 14 and sent them to trump for his expected signature, the times said. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment from reuters. former president barack obama established the rules in 2013 on operations by the military or the cia outside of war zones like afghanistan, iraq and syria.

" an israeli cabinet minister said on friday the phrasing of u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital suggested an openness to eventual palestinian control of part of the city, though he predicted israel would oppose this.  trump s announcement reversed decades of u.s. policy,  angering the arab world and alarming western allies. but he also said washington was not laying down a position on  final status   issues including boundaries of israeli sovereignty in jerusalem, which the two parties would have to decide in negotiations. israel has long deemed jerusalem its eternal, indivisible capital. palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek on land israel took in a 1967 war. its eastern sector is laden with jewish, muslim and christian holy sites that inject deep religious sensitivities into the dispute over sovereignty. in his speech on wednesday, trump did not include words echoing israel s traditional description of jerusalem. asked about this, minister zeev elkin said:  i think that his leaving this out of the speech was premeditated.  he even hinted that borders in jerusalem will also be set as a result of negotiations, which presupposes an option of partition,  said elkin, who holds the jerusalem affairs portfolio in prime minister benjamin netanyahu s government. elkin was referring to trump s caveat that the new u.s. decision on jerusalem did not constitute  taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of israeli sovereignty in jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders .   those questions are up to the parties involved,  added trump, who said washington still wanted israelis and palestinians to agree on a  two state solution  for peace. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson echoed those remarks on friday.  with respect to the rest of jerusalem the president ... did not indicate any final status for jerusalem. he was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide,  tillerson told reporters in paris. like other world powers, and in keeping with u.n. security council resolutions since the 1967 war, washington had long held off on recognizing any sovereignty in jerusalem, one of the most treacherous issues in the middle east conflict. elkin said he  would have been happy  had trump described jerusalem as israel s united capital. but he played down any possibility of partition, saying trump s administration would only pursue the idea if the netanyahu government consented.  this is a very, very important factor, and i currently have no doubt that israel would not agree. ultimately, in actuality, this is what matters,  elkin said in his remarks, carried by tel aviv 102 fm radio. trump spoke of jerusalem as  the capital the jewish people established in ancient times (and) the seat of the modern israeli government,  with freedom of worship for all faiths.   palestinian president mahmoud abbas responded angrily, saying washington had abdicated its role as peace mediator and deeming jerusalem  a palestinian, arab, christian and muslim city, the eternal capital of the state of palestine .  abbas used the arabic term  al quds , which he has generally qualified to refer to east jerusalem rather than the whole city. in three public statements welcoming the u.s. move, netanyahu has not asserted jerusalem s indivisibility under israel   heretofore stock rubric for him, as for previous prime ministers. a netanyahu spokesman did not immediately respond to a reuters query about the seeming omission.   israel s ambassador to the united states, speaking before the trump announcement, appeared to acknowledge that   in the eyes of foreign mediators, at least   jerusalem being the israeli capital may not rule out palestinian sovereignty there.  every single peace plan that s ever been put down has jerusalem be a capital of israel,  ron dermer told politico on dec. 4.  there have been other peace plans that have suggested it be capital of two states, which is a separate issue.  israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing it. but world powers and the united nations have not recognized israeli sovereignty over the entire city, saying it must be negotiated by israel and the palestinians, whose last peace talks collapsed in 2014. no other country has its embassy in jerusalem. thousands of palestinians protested in a  day of rage  on friday in the occupied west bank, gaza and in east jerusalem against trump s move on the ancient city.

" while european powers france and britain are lobbying washington to cool tensions since north korea s most powerful nuclear test a month ago, eu nations with embassies in pyongyang are directly pressing the north koreans.   a group of seven european union countries   the czech republic, sweden, poland, romania and bulgaria, as well as britain and germany   held at least two formal meetings with north korean officials in pyongyang in september, three eu diplomats said.  but they felt frustrated because the higher level access that they had obtained in pyongyang last year had fallen away, with only medium ranking foreign ministry officials now attending the meetings, the diplomats said.  there was a sense that we weren t really getting anywhere because they sent these department heads,  said a brussels based diplomat who had been briefed on the meetings, which were described as  very serious  in atmosphere and tone.   they want to talk to the united states.  the white house has ruled out such talks, with president donald trump telling secretary of state rex tillerson he would be  wasting his time  negotiating with the north koreans. the united states has no embassy in pyongyang and relies on sweden, the so called u.s. protecting power there, to do consular work, especially when westerners get into trouble.  in contrast to recent meetings, when north korean officials met eu envoys in the czech republic s embassy in 2016 to discuss issues including cultural programs and regional security, a deputy foreign minister would attend, one eu diplomat said.  for the small club of european union governments with embassies in north korea, that reflects pyongyang s anger at the eu s gradually expanding sanctions that go beyond those agreed by the united nations security council.  it could have repercussions for broader eu efforts to help mediate in the nuclear crisis, according to the eu diplomats briefed by their colleagues in pyongyang, as the bloc prepares more measures against north korea. eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini, who chaired talks on the historic 2015 nuclear deal with iran, says the bloc is ready to mediate in any talks aimed at freezing north korea s missile and nuclear weapons programs. but at the same time, the european union wants an oil embargo on pyongyang that it hopes other countries will follow.  some eu governments are pushing to cancel north korean work permits in poland and other eastern european countries because eu officials believe workers  salaries are deposited in bank accounts controlled by the regime in pyongyang.  the north koreans are starting to see the eu as a u.s. puppet, but we stress that we are an honest broker,  said a second eu diplomat.  links with the eu embassies go back years. communist czechoslovakia was a leading supplier of heavy machinery to north korea. as a soviet satellite, czechoslovakia established diplomatic ties with north korea in 1948, along with poland and romania.  the seven european embassies in pyongyang are among only 24 foreign missions there, including russia, china and cuba. the eu s status as a potential broker relies, in part, on sweden, which was the first western european nation to establish diplomatic relations with the north in 1973. sweden is a member of the neutral nations supervisory commission, which was set up to oversee the 1953 armistice between north and south korea, undertake inspections, observe military exercises and promote trust between the two sides. czechoslovakia was also a member of the neutral nations supervisory commission until the early 1990s.  sweden played a key role in the release of canadian pastor hyeon soo lim and of u.s. student otto warmbier earlier this year. but sweden has strongly backed the eu sanctions.  the seven european embassies are limited in what they can say because north korean staff, required by the government to work at the eu embassies, are expected to double as informants for pyongyang, the diplomats said.  sanctions and pressure ... sadly, we don t have anything else,  said an eu diplomat in brussels. the joint meetings with the north koreans, usually held at a single european mission, have been focused on the release of imprisoned westerners, not big diplomatic initiatives. but as efforts intensify to calm u.s. and north korean threats of war, they could still prove an important channel to pass messages between pyongyang and washington.  in the best case, we could perhaps facilitate an opening of a diplomatic track between the north koreans and the united states,  said carl bildt, a former swedish prime minister and foreign minister from 2006 to 2014. bildt said anything the eu does must be kept secret.  if the eu does something along these lines, the first thing the eu should do is not to talk about it. talking about it is a pretty good way to ensure that one can t do it,  he said. mathieu duchatel, a north korea expert at the european council on foreign relations, a think tank that bildt also now helps oversee, said the european union could chair talks between china and the united states. washington and pyongyang have no hotlines to prevent crises from spinning out of control and it is not clear what beijing s reaction would be if the united states intercepted a north korean missile test, duchatel said. for now, paris is in contact with white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and white house chief of staff john kelly, diplomats said, noting french president emmanuel macron s budding relationship with u.s. president donald trump.  lieutenant general mcmaster and kelly, a retired four star marine corps general, have a soft spot for france born of their admiration for the french military, the diplomats said. it is unclear if that translates into a direct impact on trump s thinking on north korea, european diplomats said.  they are trying to normalize trump, but i don t think trump can be normalized,  said a senior french diplomat.  to get him to listen, heads of state need to speak to him directly.  macron, who has ruled out a military option, has said he believes he could convince trump to avoid armed intervention. macron s position is to keep repeating the mantra of patience and dialogue to trump, diplomats said.

" president donald trump is asking congress for $1.6 billion to begin building a wall along the border with mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by democrats and even some conservative republicans.    an internal department of homeland security (dhs) plan in february estimated the total cost for the wall at $21.6 billion, but the white house’s budget proposal for 2018, released in full on tuesday, included a request for just $1.6 billion. two republican aides in congress said the modest request is an acknowledgement from the white house that full funding is not realistic given opposition from freedom caucus conservatives in the house of representatives as well as democrats in the house and the senate. unless trump is able to rally broader support and win more funding for construction in another fiscal year, his plans for a “big beautiful wall” that he promised during his election campaign last year may not be realized, the aides said. the budget, which includes 10 year projections for spending for most areas of the government, did not include a 10 year plan for funding wall construction.  “we are absolutely dead serious about the wall,” white house budget director mick mulvaney told reporters on tuesday.  he said the trump administration was still reviewing prototypes to determine whether to build fences, a brick and mortar wall or some other type of structure.  the $1.6 billion would allow the administration to build small parts of the proposed wall. trump has said he will find a way for mexico to repay the united states for construction of the wall but that congress would need to fund it first.  members of the house freedom caucus said earlier this year that trump would have to show how he would offset the cost of a wall, which democrats flatly oppose. facing opposition, the white house pulled its request for full funding for the wall in the 2017 fiscal year and said it would revisit the issue in the next budget.  one of the congressional aides said trump still lacks the support needed. “nothing has changed politically on the wall.” so far, the dhs has solicited bids for prototypes of a wall using $20 million in existing funds, but no government contractors have been selected to begin construction. a dhs memo shared with a senate committee last month said the agency would be able to build 34 miles (55 km) of a levee wall in texas’s rio grande valley and replace 14 miles (23 km) of fence in san diego with $1 billion.

" two young boys kneel over small white tables, intently studying the koran at a madrassa in pakistan. the al nadwa madrassa in the hill station of murree, 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the capital, islamabad, is part of an established alternative system of education in the south asian nation. private schools, charitable institutions and religious seminaries are stepping in to supplement government run schools to help meet the education needs of an estimated 50 million school age children. despite 220,000 schools nationwide, more than 20 million children are not in school, the government said in a 2016 report. the government has pumped money into schooling, with the education budget swelling by 15 percent every year since 2010, according to education consultancy alif ailaan. the united nations estimates pakistan s current education budget at 2.65 percent of gdp, roughly $8 billion, or around $150 per student.    private educators say the country s education problems are not only due to a lack of funds but also inadequate teaching.  it s not the number of schools, it s the quality, the attitude,  said zeba hussain, founder of the mashal schools which teaches children displaced by war in the country s north. hussain started the charitable mashal schools after she met a group of refugee children while visiting the hill areas surrounding islamabad.  federal education director tariq masood said blaming teachers was unfair. he said population growth and funding were the biggest challenges faced by government schools.  masood said government schools adhered to a nationwide curriculum that was being constantly reworked and improved.   no one who is underqualified can enter the government system. there are fewer checks in the private system,  he said.  the country s poor often send their children to one of the thousands of religious madrassas (the arabic word for school) where students live and receive islamic instruction.     most operate without government oversight and some madrassas have been criticized for their hardline teachings of islam. the madrassas say they provide shelter, three full meals, and a good education to young people whose families are unable to make ends meet.   in certain cases people send their kids because they can t even afford to feed them,  said irfan sher from the al nadwa madrassa.  he said pakistan s future hinged on education for its youth.   the overall policy should be changed...they should understand that if they want to change the country the only way is to spread quality education,  he said.

"a russian bank has reported to u.s. authorities that mysterious communications resumed recently between one of its computers and an email server tied to president trump s business empire, and it has developed evidence the new activity may be the work of a hacker trying to create a political hoax, circa has learned.alfa bank is asking the u.s. justice department for help solving the mystery and pledged its full cooperation.alfa wants u.s. authorities to help unmask a computer inside the united states that it believes has been used to launch cyberattacks spoofing the appearance of a backdoor communication channel between moscow and america s 45th president, according to a source directly familiar with the bank s request.the bank believes  these malicious attacks are designed to create the false impression that alfa bank has a secretive relationship with the trump organization,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.alfa bank has insisted since media stories began appearing last fall about the computer communications   known as domain name server lookups   that it has never had a relationship to trump or any of his companies and that any computer connections between the two parties  computers were innocuous. the resumption of the computer pings started last month, and alfa s cybersecurity experts traced evidence that the activity was actually being spoofed   or hacked  through a third party from a masked computer address inside the united states, the source said.  for entire story: circa newsin november of 2016, the intercept published a piece refuting a slate article that attempted to convince readers there was a connection between trump and the alfa bank servers: slate s franklin foer published a story that s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that donald trump uses a secret server to communicate with russia. that claim resulted in an explosive night of twitter confusion and misinformation.the gist of the slate article is dramatic   incredible, even: cybersecurity researchers found that the trump organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with alfa bank, russia s largest privately-held commercial bank. this is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool foer did:the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. the communication wasn t the work of bots. the irregular pattern of server look-ups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation   conversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow. it dawned on the researchers that this wasn t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank.these claims are based entirely on  dns logs,  digital records of when one server looks up how to contact another across the internet. the logs, first gathered by an anonymous researcher going by the moniker  tea leaves  (an irony that should be lost on no one) and shared with a small group of academics, were provided to the intercept and a handful of other news organizations. the new york times, the washington post, reuters, the daily beast, and vice all examined these materials to at least some extent and did not publish the claims.you can think of dns like a phone book that maps people s names to their phone numbers. for example, every time alice wants to call bob, she first looks up bob s phone number in the phone book, and then she dials the number into her phone. however, it s possible that alice might look up bob s phone number and not call him on the phone. it s even possible that she might look up bob s phone number over and over on a regular basis, over the course of months, without actually calling him. the dns look-ups that the intercept and others (including slate) reviewed are similar to records of alice looking up bob s phone number in the phone book, but to call that evidence of sinister collusion between the two is, politely, a stretch. these dns records alone simply cannot prove that any specific messages were sent at those times. in fact, they can t really prove anything at all, and certainly not  communication  between trump and alfa. this cannot be overstated: no one, not tea leaves, not his academic peers, and not franklin foer, can show that a single message was exchanged between trump and alfa.for entire story go to: the intercept ",1

" republican donald trump has forgiven nearly $50 million in loans he made to his presidential campaign, he said on thursday, signaling to donors that future contributions will be used to fight democrat hillary clinton and not to repay himself. the announcement that trump will not seek repayment of the loans via contributions came amid concerns from his backers that he does not have enough money to fund his campaign for the nov. 8 election. he had only $1.3 million in cash to start the month. “i have absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly $50 million dollars i have loaned to the campaign,” the presumptive republican nominee said in a statement. the new york developer has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the white house. “(trump) has also said he will contribute significantly more money,” steve mnuchin, the top fundraiser for trump’s campaign, said in an interview on cnbc earlier on thursday. mnuchin was the first to say that trump would forgive the loans. although trump has said he has “unlimited” personal wealth to fund his white house run, a reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to election day. gaylord hughey, a texas based fundraiser supporting trump, called trump’s decision to forgive the loans “unprecedented.” “i think it indicates that he’s all in and he wants every dollar to be spent toward a successful campaign for the general election,” hughey said. hughey, who as a bundler collects donations from other supporters, said trump was broadening the pool of donors in addition to gaining support from people who historically donate to republicans.  “we’ve had new folks come in as major donors unexpectedly,” hughey said. mnuchin also told cnbc that trump had seen a strong uptick in fundraising in the past week. he said trump raised about $10 million in conjunction with the republican party at fundraising events this week. trump also raised $6 million through online donations, mnuchin said, following the wealthy new york businessman’s first attempt to appeal to supporters to contribute to his campaign. “we’ve really ramped up the effort this month,” mnuchin said.  supporters began worrying on monday after trump’s campaign revealed weak fundraising totals. he began june far behind clinton, who had a $42 million war chest to start the month. candidates need a hefty bank account to fund a presidential bid, including hundreds of millions of dollars for television advertising and staff. trump has benefited from extensive media coverage but could be buried in attack ads if he lacks the funds to push his own message. mnuchin said trump’s numbers at the beginning of june were “irrelevant” because his fundraising efforts for the general election only started recently.  trump funded his campaign for the republican nomination largely through his own personal wealth, putting money into his campaign in the form of loans. by leaving them as loans, he would be entitled to seek repayment from his campaign. by converting the loans into contributions, trump is telling his supporters he will not seek repayment via contributions. there are no legal limits on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaigns, in contrast to caps on how much an individual, company or group can give. trump only began fundraising in earnest at the end of may. his campaign has said that donations have been “pouring in” since he started seeking contributions.  on tuesday, trump attended a dinner fundraiser in manhattan, where the attendees included billionaire activist investor carl icahn, anthony scaramucci of skybridge capital and hedge fund manager john paulson. woody johnson, owner of the new york jets football team, hosted a breakfast fundraiser for trump at a restaurant in the city. trump’s campaign was working to quickly raise large sums via a joint fundraising agreement with the republican national committee and several state republican parties.  a presidential candidate can only accept up to $5,400 from an individual donor. the joint fundraising agreement allows trump to accept checks as high as $450,000. the donations are then divided up between the campaign and the state funds.  that money is then used to hire staff and contact voters in battleground states, efforts intended to help elect trump and other republicans running for office. such states are hotly contested because their voters can swing either to republicans or democrats and play a decisive role in white house contests.

" democratic u.s. senator elizabeth warren released on friday a report criticizing what she called “shockingly weak” punishments for corporate crimes and condemned the justice department and securities and exchange commission for their lax approach. warren, in a 13 page report titled “rigged justice,” outlined 20 civil and criminal cases from 2015 that she said illustrated patterns of weak and problematic enforcement of white collar crimes, either as a result of “limited resources or lack of political will.” “the obama administration has made repeated promises to strengthen enforcement and hold corporate criminals accountable, and the doj announced in september that it would place greater emphasis on charging individuals responsible for corporate crimes,” warren wrote.  “nonetheless ... accountability for corporate crimes is shockingly weak.” warren, a favorite among progressives, criticized the justice department and federal law enforcement agencies for rarely prosecuting individuals. she called the sec “particularly feeble” and said loose regulation at other agencies often turns legal rules into suggestions, which companies can freely ignore. warren said federal law is unambiguous in stating that if a corporation has committed a violation, individuals working there also must be at fault, but that federal agencies rarely pursue convictions of large corporations or their executives. “if justice means a prison sentence for a teenager who steals a car but it means nothing more than a sideways glance at a ceo who quietly engineers the theft of billions of dollars, then the promise of equal justice under the law has turned into a lie,” she wrote. “the contrast between the treatment of highly paid executives and everyone else couldn’t be sharper.” the report, which warren said will be the first in an annual series on enforcement, described low punishment cases ranging from for profit colleges engaging in deceptive recruitment practices to general motors covering up years of ignition switch problems in its vehicles. another example listed was the upper big branch mine disaster, in which massey energy ceo donald blankenship was convicted of one misdemeanor following a mine explosion that killed 29 people, despite his company’s history of safety failures.

" u.s. president donald trump will tell leaders on a five nation asia tour the world is “running out of time” on north korea’s nuclear crisis and that he will give his strategy to isolate pyongyang a few months before making adjustments, a top aide said on thursday. trump leaves on friday for hawaii, the first stop en route to asia where he will visit japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. it will be the longest asia tour by an american president in more than 25 years. his goal will be to increase international support for an  effort to deprive north korea of resources as leverage to coerce it to give up nuclear weapons. “the president recognizes that we’re running out of time (to deal with north korea) and will ask all nations to do more,” white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster told reporters at a briefing. as part of the u.s. effort to push china, north korea’s neighbor and main trading partner, to put more pressure on pyongyang, the u.s. treasury issued a formal ruling on thursday cutting off from the u.s. financial system a chinese bank it accused of laundering money for north korean concerns. in june, the treasury department declared the bank of dandong a “primary money laundering concern” for serving as a gateway for north korea to access the u.s. and international financial systems despite u.s. and u.n. sanctions. [nl1n1jq1i4]  south korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on thursday that north korea may be planning a new missile test, after brisk activity was spotted at its research facilities. [l4n1n83mn] the u.s. military is keeping a close eye on north korea, which conducted its last missile test on sept. 15 and its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3. two guam based u.s. b 1b bombers flew through south korean airspace and over the country’s pilsung range in an exercise on thursday, the u.s. air force said. [nl2n1n827p] “the bilateral continuous bomber presence mission was planned in advance ... and was not in response to any current event,” the air force said in a statement. mcmaster said trump would urge countries with the most influence over pyongyang to “convince its leaders that the pursuit of nuclear weapons is a dead end” and that it must denuclearize. “and he will remind friend and foe alike that the united states stands ready to defend itself and our allies using the full range of our capabilities,” said mcmaster. china will be perhaps trump’s most critical stop in asia. there he will ask chinese president xi jinping to do more to rein in north korea. senior u.s. officials say china considers north korea a strategic asset and is reluctant to cut off resources to pyongyang for fear of triggering a refugee wave. mcmaster said trump, who has approved a variety of sanctions against north korea, is at the beginning of his drive for pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons. trump has warned he would “totally destroy” north korea if it threatened the united states or its allies. “i think we have to be a little patient here for at least a few months to see what more we and others can do, including china,” said mcmaster. “i don’t think we need to reassess our strategy now. i think we have to give it a couple of months, a few months, and then see what adjustments we might need to make.” trump is expected to press xi to reduce oil exports to north korea and coal imports from pyongyang and limit financial transactions. the chinese leader is newly ascendant after consolidating power at a communist party congress.

" nigeria s government has a plan for the northeast, torn apart by eight years of conflict with boko haram: displaced people will be housed in fortified garrison towns, ringed by farms, with the rest of the countryside effectively left to fend for itself. the vision for the state of borno, ground zero for the war with the islamist insurgency, is a stark admission of the reality in the northeast. for two years, the military and government have said boko haram is all but defeated, and the remnants are being mopped up.  but the military is largely unable to control territory beyond the cities and towns it has wrested back from boko haram. that means many of the nearly 2 million displaced people across the northeast cannot return to their homes in rural areas. kashim shettima, the governor of borno state, said it was not possible for people to live in small villages.  there s beauty in numbers, there s security in numbers. so our target is to congregate all the people in five major urban settlements and provide them with means of livelihood, education, health care and of course security,  he told reuters.  it s a long term solution, certainly.   the plan for the eastern part of the state, centered on the town of bama, is intended as a pilot scheme to be rolled out in other parts of borno if it is successful. vigilantes, currently members of a group known as the civilian joint task force, will become agricultural rangers, the governor said.  aided by nigerian security forces, they will aim to secure and patrol a five km (three mile) radius around each garrison town where people can farm. peter lundberg, the united nations deputy humanitarian coordinator for nigeria, who heads the organization s response in the northeast, said the reconstruction of bama town, the second biggest in the state, was  logical .   people are very eager to go back if the conditions are right and if the conditions are safe, if the conditions are dignified, and of course it has to be voluntary,  he told reuters. sentiment amongst the displaced is mixed. abubakar goni, who lived outside bama before fleeing to the borno state capital maiduguri, said he wants to return home, but if the town is safer he will agree to go there.  i will support it as long as i will have a place to farm. i am also happy to hear the government will give us protection on the farm because i learnt boko haram men are still around.  others, like tijja modu alhaji, are wary of potential disputes between residents of the towns where people will be sent and the returnees.  i don t want to stay in bama because i will still be a stranger there, just as i am in maiduguri now,  he said.  i want to go home, not to somebody else s land.  the governor s plan is still in its early stages. it involves bringing back thousands of people who fled the town of bama and the surrounding area and sought refuge in camps in maiduguri and elsewhere.  they will eventually be housed in towns such as bama, which was largely abandoned by its inhabitants when boko haram took it three years ago, but has since been recaptured by the military. many of bama s buildings are still shells, windows smashed, doors ripped out and roofs gone. telephone and electricity wires remain torn down, more than two years after the military evicted boko haram. it is not clear how the returnees will be housed. there are already 15,000 people in a crowded camp for displaced local residents set up by the military after it retook the town. the united nations had planned to move them gradually to new shelters accommodating 30,000 people that have been erected in the town, but the military said it could not oversee two camps there at the same time, un and military officials told reuters. the government has announced plans to build 3,000 homes in the bama area. but there are concerns about how people sent to the town will manage, since many did not originally live there.  it s one thing to move people to bama,  said lundberg.  unless the engine of the economy can restart, the risk is that people are moving back to places where they will become very dependent (on aid).  aid workers said the demarcation between garrison towns and a lawless countryside means people have a choice: live in virtual quarantine, or return to their homes in the countryside, where boko haram roam, and be treated by security forces as potential insurgency sympathizers.   you re imprisoned, but you re safe,  said one senior relief worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.  if you prefer your own life you can do it on the outside.  boko haram s recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed at least 50 in a mosque in adamawa state last week, are the  last kicks of a dying horse,  nigeria s information minister lai mohammed said last sunday. but military and diplomatic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said overstretched troops are unable to push boko haram out of non urban areas. much of borno is not under the authorities  control and attacks are rife.  on saturday, suicide bombers killed at least 13 people in the town of biu and injured 53 others.  borno is not getting better at all. it may have even gotten worse,  a diplomat said of the security situation outside urban areas.  there is no recovery and stabilization.

" a top iranian official and lebanon s saad al hariri gave conflicting accounts on tuesday of a key meeting they had held right before hariri quit as prime minister, a move he attributed to regional meddling by iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah. the shock resignation has thrust lebanon back onto the front line of a power struggle between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran   a rivalry that has also buffeted syria, iraq, yemen and bahrain.  hariri flew to riyadh on nov. 3, after meeting in beirut ali akbar velayati, the top foreign policy adviser to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei.   hariri claims that in our meeting he asked iran to stop interfering in the lebanese affairs, but he did not say such a thing,  velayati was quoted as saying by iranian state television s website on tuesday.  our meeting was not tense or violent at all. these are all lies,  he said.      velayati said iran hoped hariri would return to lebanon, accusing riyadh of fanning the flames of tension as it  could not tolerate the strategic friendship  between tehran and beirut. hariri denied velayati s account that the lebanese leader had offered to mediate between iran and saudi arabia.  prime minister hariri did not offer mediation between any countries,  a statement from his press office said.   he presented to velayati his point of view about the need to stop iranian interventions in yemen as a gateway and a precondition for any improvement in ties between (iran) and the kingdom,  it said.  a long time saudi ally, hariri had first mentioned the velayati meeting in a television interview on sunday night, his first public comments since quitting.  he warned lebanon was at risk of gulf arab sanctions because of regional meddling by shi ite hezbollah and said he would return to lebanon within days. in his resignation speech in a broadcast from saudi arabia on nov. 4, hariri said he feared assassination and accused iran along with hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world. top lebanese government officials and senior politicians close to hariri believe saudi arabia coerced him into quitting and has been holding him against his will since, though hariri and riyadh have denied this.

" the palestinian islamist group hamas named as its new deputy chief on thursday a formerly turkey based commander whom israel has accused of orchestrating a lethal triple kidnapping that helped trigger the 2014 gaza war. saleh al arouri s promotion comes as hamas seeks to close ranks with u.s. backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a decade old schism, in an entente israel says will not revive peace talks unless hamas recognizes its right to exist and disarms. the palestinian information center, a hamas linked news site, said arouri, who was born in the occupied west bank and was exiled by israel in 2010 after long stints in its prisons, had been elected as deputy to the group s leader ismail haniyeh.  he (arouri) is now the hamas movement s no. 2 man,  the site said.  twenty three years of detention and expulsion have not weakened the resolve of the leader saleh al arouri, 51.  after three israeli teens were abducted and killed in the west bank in june 2014, arouri   then in istanbul   claimed responsibility in the name of hamas. israel responded with a west bank security sweep which, along with the revenge killing of a palestinian youth from jerusalem by a group of israelis, spiraled into a 50 day war in the gaza strip, hamas  fiefdom. gaza health officials say 2,100 palestinians were killed in the conflict, while israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians. israel also pressed ankara s islamist rooted government to crack down on arouri, describing him as the mastermind of the kidnappings and other hamas militant attacks. hamas sources said arouri left turkey in late 2015 for qatar and later lebanon. they declined to give his current location.

"rick scott has been governor of florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. while the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of hiv and the number of people dying from aids drops, florida is seeing the reverse.in a comprehensive review of how scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the miami herald discovered two disturbing facts: florida now leads the nation in hiv cases, and its biggest county, miami-dade, is ground zero.new cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. miami-dade and broward together account for 38 percent of that total.although florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the department of health.the 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year scott took office. it s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said sen. oscar braynon, d-miami gardens.  we have a rise in aids and we have a reduction in public health spending. we re now cutting just to be cutting. indeed, scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. he s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as kansas governor sam brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and michigan governor rick snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).however, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. at least brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. in a disturbing reminder of the reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the aids epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in hiv cases. or perhaps he s just grown used to it. after his first year in office, the number of hiv cases has grown hand-over-fist.making matters worse, scott has routinely fought against working with obamacare in his state. for years. all the while, hiv cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. this spells disasters for the victims of hiv because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier aids illness is careful health management. you can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the president.as we ve seen around the country, republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  it s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.feature image via gage skidmore/flickr",1
" a german court sentenced an 88 year old woman to six months in prison on monday for denying the holocaust and for inciting hatred. ursula haverbeck, who describes herself as a revisionist historian, said at a public event in january 2016 that gas chambers in auschwitz concentration camp  were not real . a court in berlin found haverbeck guilty after examining a short video of her speech in which she said that she was citing a book, not expressing her own views. the court, however, found the speech to be her own and gave her six months in prison. denying the holocaust, in which six million jews were killed, is a crime in germany, punishable by up to five years in prison. haverbeck, who is avoiding going to jail by appealing the verdict, has faced similar legal cases across germany. the latest was by a court in north rhine westphalia last summer when she was given a 10 month prison sentence for the same charges.

" gasoline and diesel prices rose sharply in north korea after its sixth nuclear test and as the u.n. security council imposed new sanctions capping fuel supply, market data analyzed by reuters on monday showed.  the security council unanimously passed a resolution on sept. 11 banning exports of condensates and natural gas liquids to the north and capping the annual supply of refined petroleum products at two million barrels and crude at its current levels. the price of gasoline sold by private dealers in the capital pyongyang and northern border cities of sinuiju and hyesan spiked to $2.51 per kg as of sept. 13, up 45.1 percent from $1.73 per kg on sept. 5, according to reuters analysis of data compiled by the daily nk website.  the website is run by north korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with traders in the north. diesel prices also surged 61.5 percent from $1.30 per kg to $2.10 per kg during the same period.   lee sang yong, who speaks regularly to sources inside the north and supervises market data from them, said the price hikes were caused primarily by a cut in supplies as the regime scrambles to hoard fuel, wary of a potential fuel crunch.  north korean authorities are likely to have intentionally reduced supplies in the market after the nuclear test, thinking the u.n. security council sanctions would affect their own repository,  lee said.  in addition, astute traders are cutting their supplies on the expectations that the prices would go up further, while there s some psychological effect among ordinary citizens who worry about war.  u.n. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said on sunday the security council has run out of options on containing the north s nuclear programmer and washington may have to turn the matter over to the defense department. north korea launched a missile over japan into the pacific ocean on thursday in defiance of the new security council. white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster said on friday, after the latest north korean missile launch, that the united states was running out of patience:  we ve been kicking the can down the road, and we re out of road.  the latest gasoline price represents a 70.7 percent and 153.5 percent surge compared with statistics posted on june 8 and dec. 1, respectively, less than one week after the security council adopted its last two resolutions on north korea.  north korea gets most of its fuel from china and some from russia. u.s. and south korean officials have said the north imports some 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products and two million barrels of crude oil each year.

" democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s campaign deployed a popular surrogate on friday to gin up enthusiasm amid young voters who could be critical to victory on nov. 8: michelle obama. the u.s. first lady and wife of president barack obama, who won the white house in 2008 and 2012 with high levels of support from young voters, told a crowd of students in virginia that they could mean the difference between a clinton win or a loss to republican nominee donald trump. “let’s be clear, elections aren’t just about who votes, but who doesn’t vote. and that is especially true for young people like all of you,” she said, noting that voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for obama in the swing states of ohio, pennsylvania, florida and virginia in 2012. “without those votes, barack would have lost those states and he definitely would have lost that election. period, end of story,” she said. a new york times/cbs poll this week showed clinton with more support from people under 30 than trump but still well below the levels obama achieved.  though she has not yet been a frequent presence on the 2016 campaign trail, mrs. obama has proven to be an especially powerful advocate for clinton, her husband’s one time rival. her speech in support of clinton at the democratic convention in july was praised as one of the best of that event. “i’m inspired,” she said, listing clinton’s positions in public service and rejecting arguments that clinton was not an inspiring figure. the current first lady praised the former first lady as one of the most qualified people for the office of president in history. “so we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. because here is what we know: that being president isn’t anything like reality tv,”  mrs. obama said, referring to trump, a former reality television host. a president could not just “pop off” when making life or death decisions about war and peace, she said without naming trump.   mrs. obama noted that the country was in a time of transition, just like her family, which was about to move into a new house. she joked that they had to make sure the white house was cleaned up so they could get their security deposit back. then she referred to the transition in 2008 with a dig at trump for questioning whether barack obama was born in hawaii. on friday he finally conceded that obama was u.s. born. “there were those who questioned, and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day, whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said to boos. “i think barack has answered those questions with the example he’s set: by going high when they go low.”  ",0

" a court on friday sentenced a radicalized french woman to 10 years in prison after traveling to syria where her son was fighting alongside islamic state militants.  christine riviere, 51, dubbed by investigators as  jihadi gran , was arrested in 2014 after three trips to syria, which she said were aimed at spending time with her son in case he was killed. announcing the decision, the judge said riviere had demonstrated  a firm commitment  to islamic state and had contributed to strengthening the group logistically.  france, like other european nations, is wrestling with how to deal with those returning from the syrian conflict. a presidency official said last week that half of the 500 children were born there, and in total about 2,000 french nationals or residents had gone to the two countries,  instead of trying to disengage your son, it seems on the contrary that you encouraged him,  the judge said. investigators believe that riviere s son, tyler vilus, climbed the islamic state hierarchy to lead a francophile group. arrested in july 2015 in turkey and now imprisoned in france, vilus is suspected of having known members of the network that planned and carried out the november 2015 attacks in paris in which 130 people were killed.      the sentencing comes a week after a mother of three was found guilty of financing terrorism after she sent money abroad to her radicalized son who later traveled to fight in syria. she was sentenced to two years in jail.

" the u.s. justice department filed an appeal late saturday to restore president donald trump’s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees, even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted. the government moved to reverse a federal judge’s friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public, thwarted enforcement of an executive order and “second guesses the president’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of (non citizens) and the best means of minimizing that risk.”  friday’s ruling prompted trump to denounce the “so called” judge in a series of tweets on saturday..  the appeal now goes to a three judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal. a justice department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. a ruling could come at any time. seattle u.s. district judge james robart’s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the united states.  trump, whose personal attack on robart, decrying his opinion as “ridiculous,” went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the white house and congress, said he was confident the government would prevail. “we’ll win. for the safety of the country, we’ll win,” he told reporters in florida. robart’s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of washington state and was backed by major state employers amazon.com inc and expedia inc.. the lawsuit is one of several now filed against the trump executive order around the united states, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide. the justice department appeal criticized robart’s legal reasoning, saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president’s authority as commander chief. the appeal said the state of washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order “favors christians at the expense of muslims.” congress gave the president “the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class” of visitor, the justice department wrote. “courts are particularly ill equipped to second guess the president’s prospective judgment about future risks,” the appeal said, calling the decision “vastly overbroad.” washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at u.s. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president’s directive. a spokesman for washington state attorney general bob ferguson didn’t immediately comment early sunday. the u.s. state department and department of homeland security said they were complying with robart’s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on sunday, while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on monday. a decision to reinstate trump’s order could again cause havoc at u.s. airports because some visitors are in transit, as was the case when the order took effect on jan. 27. as the ban lifted friday, refugees and thousands of travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the  executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the united states. the panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former republican president george w. bush and two former democratic presidents, jimmy carter and barack obama. u.s. immigration advocacy groups including the american civil liberties union on saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations “to consider rebooking travel to the united states immediately” because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold. a u.s. state department email reviewed by reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including syrians as soon as monday. trump’s jan. 27 order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority muslim nations for 90 days, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred syrian refugees.  it is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the u.s. constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and congress. reached by email saturday, robart declined comment on trump’s tweets. democratic u.s. senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement saturday that trump’s “hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. he seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.” in an interview with abc scheduled to air sunday, vice president mike pence said he did not think that trump’s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. the court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to trump’s push to clamp down on immigration. the sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the united states will remain open. in erbil, the capital of the kurdish region of northern iraq, fuad sharef and his family prepared to fly on saturday to istanbul and then new york before starting a new life in nashville, tennessee. virtually all refugees also were barred by trump’s order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the united states.

" public approval of president donald trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on friday, after trump was accused of mishandling classified information and meddling with an fbi investigation. the may 14 18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of trump while 56 percent disapproved. the remaining 6 percent had “mixed feelings.”  americans appear to have soured on trump after a tumultuous week in the white house during which the president fought back a steady drumbeat of critical news reports that ramped up concerns about his administration’s ties to russia. the week started with revelations that trump shared highly classified information with russian diplomats in a private meeting. that was followed by reports that former federal bureau of investigation director james comey, whom trump recently fired, had written memos expressing concerns that the president had pressured him to stop investigating trump campaign ties to russia.  later in the week, the justice department appointed former fbi director robert mueller to oversee an independent probe into contacts between russia and the trump campaign. trump has denied colluding with the russians and called ongoing efforts to investigate him a “witch hunt.” no politician in history, he said, “has been treated worse or more unfairly.”  while trump remains popular with members of his own party, many rank and file republicans appear to have backed off their support for the president during the past week.  among republicans, 23 percent expressed disapproval of trump in the latest poll, up from 16 percent in the same poll last week. the decline in support from republicans appears to be a primary reason why trump’s overall approval rating is now at the lowest level since he took office. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english across the united states. it gathered responses from 1,971 adults, including 721 republicans and 795 democrats. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for the democrats and republicans.

" u.s. catholics voiced support for pope francis on sunday after he criticized donald trump’s immigration stance as “not christian,” but many interviewed by reuters said the controversy would not necessarily sour them on the republican presidential contender. the pontiff injected himself into the u.s. campaign during a conversation with reporters on his flight home from mexico on thursday. in his comments, francis disparaged trump’s vow to build a wall along the southern u.s. border to keep out illegal immigrants. a sampling of opinion from people before and after sunday mass suggested that many catholics saw the pope’s comments as well intentioned and grounded in a moral worldview. many said francis, who has become a champion of inclusion in his three year tenure as head of the roman catholic church, was right to insist on the humane treatment of all immigrants.  even so, most of those interviewed in boston and new york would not rule out voting for trump based on what francis said. about 21 percent of the u.s. population identifies as catholic. “i agree with the pope as far as being a true christian, you accept everybody,” said paul nappi, 65, outside our lady of mount carmel in brooklyn, new york. “i happen to like trump but i don’t know if he’s literally about building walls or that’s just a figure of speech.” many churchgoers said the media unfairly whipped up the controversy to goad the pope and trump into a fight days before saturday’s south carolina republican primary. trump’s victory there made the billionaire real estate mogul the clear front runner for his party’s nomination for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. “it’s very treacherous for the media to ask those questions to the pope because they were questions inspired by the media itself,” said catalina carmona, 31, a lawyer visiting new york from colombia. “he was put in a difficult situation and he said what a leader in his position would be able to say.” francis never directly criticized trump or mentioned him by name when he told reporters: “a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not christian.” carol menkiti, 76, of somerville, massachusetts, said of the pope’s remarks: “i felt he was using an analogy that’s often used. i love the pope.”  “i don’t think he comments on politics, but he talks about the human condition,” she said after attending mass at st. paul’s church in cambridge, massachusetts. a spokesman for francis sought on friday to tone down the controversy, insisting the pontiff was not making a personal attack on trump or any statement about the u.s. election. after initially saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to judge another’s faith in god, the blunt spoken trump said francis was “a nice man” who was probably misinterpreted by the media. but from the pulpit of st. paul’s, the rev. james flavin did not shy away from the issue. in his sunday sermon, he linked the pope’s remarks about “walls” to many of the social justice themes he has sounded since his papacy began in march 2013. “the pope denounced a world divided by walls,” flavin said. “he’s challenging us to change the world through our imitation of christ.” how much the pope’s views will influence u.s. catholics in the voting booth is an open question, but parishioners suggested a muted impact at best. while most of those interviewed said they respected the pope’s moral authority, joe ruggiero, 70, thought francis sometimes “gets a little carried away” with what he characterized as a “basically socialist” point of view. “catholics believe the pope is infallible in issues of faith, not issues of politics,” ruggiero said outside the cathedral of the holy cross in boston. nappi said the pope’s influence over catholics would not necessarily be the sole determining factor in how catholics vote.  “i think anytime the pope says something, of course it’ll have an affect on catholic voters,” he said. “me personally, i like to weigh all the issues before i make a definitive opinion one way or another.”  (additional reporting by scott malone in boston; writing by frank mcgurty; editing by peter cooney) this article was funded in part by sap. it was independently created by the reuters editorial staff. sap had no editorial involvement in its creation or production.",0

" two western backed syrian rebel groups fighting the syrian army and iranian backed militias in southeastern syria have been asked by their western and arab backers to pull out of the area and retreat into jordan, rebels and diplomatic sources said on sunday. both usoud al sharqiya and martyr ahmad abdo, part of the free syrian army group, said they were told to end fighting in the area by their backers from the u.s. central intelligence agency and neighboring states that support them, which include jordan and saudi arabia.  there is a official request for us to leave the area,  said badr al din al salamah, a senior official in the usoud al sharqiya group, one of the main rebel groups in the area and  a recipient of the military aid from the u.s. backed alliance. since early this year, the rebels have pushed islamic state militants out of a large swathe of sparsely populated territory stretching some 50 km (30 miles) southeast of damascus, all the way to the iraqi border along the frontier with jordan. but an offensive by the syrian army, backed by iranian militias and heavy russian air cover, has encircled the rebels and eroded their gains. in recent weeks, the army has regained a string of border posts with jordan that it had abandoned in the early years of the conflict western diplomatic sources said the request was tied to a decision by the administration of u.s. president trump in july to halt the cia s program to equip and train rebel groups fighting the government of syrian president bashar al assad.  the cia program began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then president barack obama to overthrow assad. the trump administration says its strategy in syria is focused only on defeating islamic state. in a letter purportedly to rebel commanders and seen by reuters, they were told they although they had fought bravely to fend off the syrian army, their presence in a small enclave now posed a threat to them. the decision has caused disaffection among hundreds of fighters in the two groups, who consider withdrawing into jordan as effectively disbanding their forces. the two groups, who have hundreds of fighters, will have to hand over heavy artillery and dozens of u.s. made anti tank missiles that played a part in their battlefield successes against islamic state and the iranian backed militias, rebels say. in a meeting on saturday, the rebel commanders told the joint operations center in jordan that requested their withdrawal they would rather  stay and die  in the desert than leave the battlefield.  we have rejected the request,  since if we entered jordan we would consider it the end ... the blood of our martyrs has not dried yet,  said al salameh. the military operations center has not offered them a choice to move to a u.s. garrison further east near the border with iraq in tanf, the rebels say. that garrison, run by a separate program of the pentagon, hosts an arab rebel tribal group known as the maqhawir al thwra. another rebel official said they were not necessarily opposed to withdrawing, but they wanted assurances from jordan they could lobby to expand to the badia area a u.s. russian brokered ceasefire, which has halted fighting in southwest syria. washington and jordan are currently negotiating with moscow to implement a de escalation zone that would push back iranian backed forces 40 kms north of the border strip with jordan, diplomats say.   we have accepted in principle and there are matters that have to be resolved. but until this moment there is no final agreement on withdrawing and we are still in the badia and still fighting and in our posts,  said said seif, a spokesman of the martyr ahmad abdo group.

" the united states does not aim to impede european trade and business transactions with iran despite president donald trump s decision last week to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement, secretary of state rex tillerson told the wall street journal. european union leaders in brussels on thursday highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with iran from any adverse effects should washington reinstate sanctions against iran, officials said.  the president s been pretty clear that it s not his intent to interfere with business deals that the europeans may have under way with iran,  tillerson told the journal in an interview thursday.  he s said it clearly:  that s fine. you guys do what you want to do.  trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal struck with the united states and five other powers including britain, france and germany. the republican president gave congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for scaling down a program the west fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something tehran denies.  trump has criticized the nuclear accord as  the worst deal ever  and has vowed to withdraw if congress and european allies do not address his problems with it. tillerson s comments appeared aimed at reassuring the europeans that washington is not trying to pressure them into avoiding business with iran.  we ve been working with the europeans for six months,  tillerson said.  they have been brought along with this same thought process. it doesn t mean that they necessarily agree entirely with it. ... now we will start a more formalized process with them now that the policy s been adopted.  the journal said tillerson would not discuss the multibillion dollar deals reached by boeing co (ba.n) under the 2015 accord. boeing, which was the first major u.s. company to announce a major business venture with iran, last year agreed to sell dozens of commercial planes to tehran.

" the european commission said on friday that enough progress had been made in brexit negotiations to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin. the following is a summary of a joint eu uk report showing the agreements on three key topics: refers to british citizens, including spouses and children, living in an eu state and other eu nationals living in britain on date of its withdrawal. it does not give british citizens a right to move from one eu state to another and retain the same rights, while rights for eu and british citizens lapse if they leave their original host country for five years. negotiations may continue in the second phase, with britain looking for  onward movement  rights for its citizens on the continent and the eu interested in citizens keeping permanent residence rights even after longer spells absent from the host country. citizens with permanent residence documents should get new ones free of charge. equal treatment will cover rights with respect to social security, health care, employment and education. benefits will be  exportable  as they are now. future spouses, children and other core family members can join citizens enjoying protected rights. the european court of justice (ecj) is the ultimate arbiter of eu law. the agreement states that  uk courts shall therefore have due regard to relevant decisions of the (ecj) . the eu and britain have agreed to set up a mechanism enabling uk courts to ask the ecj to weigh in when necessary during an eight year period following brexit. eight years is enough to build up a body of common jurisprudence, officials say. even at present, eu courts are not obliged to allow appeals to the ecj. in phase two, the sides will negotiate on how the withdrawal treaty can be enforced   for example, if the eu believes uk courts are systematically misinterpreting eu citizens  rights. britain promises to preserve the integrity of its own internal market and northern ireland s place within it. it says it does not want a hard border between ireland and northern ireland, saying it aims to avoid checks and controls there via a future eu uk economic relationship. if this is not possible, britain says it will propose  specific solutions to address the unique circumstances . in the absence of such solutions, britain will  maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support north south cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 (good friday peace) agreement.  it pledges to ensure there are  no new regulatory barriers  and  unfettered access  for northern ireland s businesses to the rest of britain. both parties acknowledge that the 1998 agreement recognizes the birth right of all people of northern ireland to be irish, british or both.  both parties have agreed a methodology for the financial settlement ... drawn up and paid in euro.  the settlement will be calculated in terms of a percentage of the budget for 2014 2020, with britain contributing as if it had stayed in the eu for 2019 and 2020 and including a british rebate. following its withdrawal from the eu, the uk will continue to participate in the eu programs financed by the 2014 2020 budget until their closure. beyond then, britain will remain liable for its share of the eu s contingent liabilities, such as financial assistance or operations managed by the european investment bank (eib):  the uk liability will be limited to decisions on each financial operation adopted prior to the date of withdrawal.  to avoid a disruption to the eib s operations, britain will provide a guarantee for an amount equal to its callable capital. this guarantee will decrease over time.  the uk share of the paid in capital will be reimbursed in 12 annual installments starting at the end of 2019. the first eleven installments will be 300 million euros each and the final one will be 195,903,950 euros.  on the european central bank,  the paid in capital of the uk in the ecb will be reimbursed to the bank of england (boe) after the date of withdrawal . british officials said they estimated the final bill at some 40 45 billion euros. the eu, which once estimated the cost at around 60 billion, declined to offer its own estimate, arguing that too much is dependent on future variables, such as whether loan guarantees advanced by the eu end up being exercised. britain would pay 17 18 billion euros to the eu budget between brexit and the end of the current eu seven year budget plan in december 2020, british officials estimate, and a further 21 23 billion after that to settle ongoing commitments, plus 2 4 billion euros on net liabilities, including eu staff pensions.

" a federal judge in texas on saturday issued a court order barring enforcement of an obama administration policy seeking to extend anti discrimination protections under the affordable care act to transgender health and abortion related services. the decision sides with texas, seven other states and three christian affiliated healthcare groups challenging a rule that, according to the judge, defines sex bias to include “discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy.” in granting an injunction one day before the new policy was to take effect, u.s. district judge reed o’connor held that it violates the administrative procedure act, a federal law governing rule making practices.  the judge also ruled that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in court on their claim that the new policy infringes on the rights of private healthcare providers under the religious freedom restoration act. as explained in o’connor’s 46 page opinion, the plaintiffs argued that the new regulation would “require them to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender transitions and abortions, regardless of their contrary religious beliefs or medical judgment.” the same judge issued a similar court order in august blocking a separate obama administration policy that would have required public schools, over the objections of 13 states, to allow transgender students to use restrooms of their choice. it was not immediately clear whether the obama administration, which has just 20 days left in office, would seek to appeal the latest injunction. white house spokeswoman katie hill decried the ruling. “today’s decision is a setback, but hopefully a temporary one, since all americans   regardless of their sex, gender identity or sexual orientation   should have access to quality, affordable health care free from discrimination,” she said. the affordable care act (aca), also known as obamacare, was passed in 2010 with an anti discrimination section designed to prevent insurers from charging customers more or denying coverage based on age, race, national origin, disability or sex. the rule in dispute on saturday was adopted by the u.s. health and human services (hhs) department to implement those provisions, including definitions for sex discrimination that encompassed transgender and abortion services. according to the court opinion, gender identity was defined under that rule as “an individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be different from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.” the state of texas has led a string of legal cases brought by republican controlled states contesting various social policies advanced by president barack obama, most notably his 2014 executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the united states illegally and give them work permits.  that plan, challenged by texas and other states, has been barred by the courts. but the u.s. supreme court in 2012 and 2015 issued rulings that kept the affordable care act, his top legislative achievement, intact.

" republican donald trump has forgiven nearly $50 million in loans he made to his presidential campaign, he said on thursday, signaling to donors that future contributions will be used to fight democrat hillary clinton and not to repay himself. the announcement that trump will not seek repayment of the loans via contributions came amid concerns from his backers that he does not have enough money to fund his campaign for the nov. 8 election. he had only $1.3 million in cash to start the month. “i have absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly $50 million dollars i have loaned to the campaign,” the presumptive republican nominee said in a statement. the new york developer has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the white house. “(trump) has also said he will contribute significantly more money,” steve mnuchin, the top fundraiser for trump’s campaign, said in an interview on cnbc earlier on thursday. mnuchin was the first to say that trump would forgive the loans. although trump has said he has “unlimited” personal wealth to fund his white house run, a reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to election day. gaylord hughey, a texas based fundraiser supporting trump, called trump’s decision to forgive the loans “unprecedented.” “i think it indicates that he’s all in and he wants every dollar to be spent toward a successful campaign for the general election,” hughey said. hughey, who as a bundler collects donations from other supporters, said trump was broadening the pool of donors in addition to gaining support from people who historically donate to republicans.  “we’ve had new folks come in as major donors unexpectedly,” hughey said. mnuchin also told cnbc that trump had seen a strong uptick in fundraising in the past week. he said trump raised about $10 million in conjunction with the republican party at fundraising events this week. trump also raised $6 million through online donations, mnuchin said, following the wealthy new york businessman’s first attempt to appeal to supporters to contribute to his campaign. “we’ve really ramped up the effort this month,” mnuchin said.  supporters began worrying on monday after trump’s campaign revealed weak fundraising totals. he began june far behind clinton, who had a $42 million war chest to start the month. candidates need a hefty bank account to fund a presidential bid, including hundreds of millions of dollars for television advertising and staff. trump has benefited from extensive media coverage but could be buried in attack ads if he lacks the funds to push his own message. mnuchin said trump’s numbers at the beginning of june were “irrelevant” because his fundraising efforts for the general election only started recently.  trump funded his campaign for the republican nomination largely through his own personal wealth, putting money into his campaign in the form of loans. by leaving them as loans, he would be entitled to seek repayment from his campaign. by converting the loans into contributions, trump is telling his supporters he will not seek repayment via contributions. there are no legal limits on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaigns, in contrast to caps on how much an individual, company or group can give. trump only began fundraising in earnest at the end of may. his campaign has said that donations have been “pouring in” since he started seeking contributions.  on tuesday, trump attended a dinner fundraiser in manhattan, where the attendees included billionaire activist investor carl icahn, anthony scaramucci of skybridge capital and hedge fund manager john paulson. woody johnson, owner of the new york jets football team, hosted a breakfast fundraiser for trump at a restaurant in the city. trump’s campaign was working to quickly raise large sums via a joint fundraising agreement with the republican national committee and several state republican parties.  a presidential candidate can only accept up to $5,400 from an individual donor. the joint fundraising agreement allows trump to accept checks as high as $450,000. the donations are then divided up between the campaign and the state funds.  that money is then used to hire staff and contact voters in battleground states, efforts intended to help elect trump and other republicans running for office. such states are hotly contested because their voters can swing either to republicans or democrats and play a decisive role in white house contests.

" organizers of pop concerts and some other big events are increasingly wary of including malaysia on their itineraries, as the cancellation of a beer festival due to take place next month highlighted growing intolerance toward activities regarded as insulting to islam by some muslim groups. the promoters say that international music stars, especially those known for risqu  lyrics or revealing clothing, are unlikely to be brought to malaysia as part of regional or global tours. the same goes for any gatherings that could in any way be deemed un islamic. while such concerns have been building for some time in this majority sunni muslim nation, the organizers say that the atmosphere has become particularly difficult in the past year.  the politicization of islam has increased as prime minister najib razak s ruling party seeks to appease more fundamentalist elements to secure its large, rural malay vote bank ahead of an election expected in the coming months. a united nations cultural rights expert warned in a report last week that there is growing pressure to adopt a more narrow interpretation of the islamic religion and identity in malaysia, which excludes the country s cross cultural history, marginalizes religious minorities, and fails to take account of the diversity of malay muslims.  of course it does affect the overall attractiveness of malaysia being a venue for artists, events or festivals to be held. with artists  touring of southeast asia, malaysia will not be the first choice for any act to tour,  said darren choy, the chairman of the recording industry association of malaysia who also heads the malaysian unit of american entertainment and record label group warner music.  it may end up being the last to be considered, or not at all,  he added.   the malaysian government did not respond to requests for  comment for this story.   the popular better beer festival 2017, which has been held for the past five years, was unexpectedly called off last week after the kuala lumpur city council banned the october 6 7 event. the ban followed protests by the pan malaysian islamic party (pas), who said the event would turn the capital into  the largest vice center in asia.  the beer festival s organizers said that authorities called it off  due to the political sensitivity surrounding the event .  police said later that it was canceled because of the threat of a militant attack. pas said on thursday it has now also filed an objection over plans to host next month the annual oktoberfest beer festival in the petaling jaya area of the capital. the party said in a statement that it was its  social responsibility  to oppose alcohol festivals. also last week, after rumors that a gay party was being planned for kuala lumpur, the government issued a ban notice, and ordered immigration officers to deny entry to anyone planning to attend either that or the better beer festival. the gay party organizers said they only ever intended to hold the party in thailand, not malaysia. enforcement authorities last month launched a probe into the kuala lumpur chapter of atheists republic, a canada based organization. a minister in najib s cabinet said later that muslim apostates should be  hunted down vehemently . malaysia has already made international headlines this year for barring the screening of the 2017 edition of disney s  beauty and the beast  due to a  gay moment  in one scene. the film was eventually released after local distributors asked the censor board to review the decision. shortly after, the catchy summer dance song  despacito  was taken off state radio and television stations after complaints that the lyrics were obscene.   for some years it has been getting more difficult for international pop stars who wish to make appearances in malaysia. in 2013, a concert set to be performed by musical artist, kesha, was banned. in the past, artists such as beyonce have canceled performances in malaysia due to restrictions over costumes and dancing. a concert by american pop star selena gomez was only allowed in july 2016 after assurances that she would cover herself up. but fear of trouble at the concert   pas youth leaders  protested outside the venue   kept many fans away and thousands of tickets were left unsold. there have been no big western acts so far this year, though  british singer ed sheeran is expected to perform in kuala lumpur in november.   this weekend s formula 1 malaysian grand prix does not include major international pop stars as has usually been the case in recent years. organizers denied this was due to recent controversies.  you have to be very careful about the type of acts you book and make sure you comply with all the rules and even then, there s no guarantee it will be approved by the authorities,  said qisthina razin, representative of malaysian events organization, freeform.   rizal kamal, vice president of the arts, live festivals and the arts association (alife), a body representing event organizers, said malaysian show producers have started moving out.    malaysian producers are going to singapore and indonesia due to problems in malaysia,  he said.   choy said the bans are  denting the perception of malaysia being a moderate and tolerant islamic country.  the impact of religious fundamentalism isn t just about malaysia s image to the outside world. it also gnaws away at the country s multicultural and pluralistic fabric. about 40 percent of malaysia s population is non muslim, including christians, buddhists and hindus. najib s approach risks empowering and legitimizing  conservative parties and organizations once only classified as extreme fringe groups. such religious organizations are also in an increasingly strong position to influence the government and its policies.  united nations special rapporteur karima bennoune in her report last week expressed deep concern at the level of involvement of religious authorities in policy decisions. she said some malaysians have expressed concern about a growing islamisation, which represented a  significant break with the past . bennoune expressed particular concern over bans regarding traditional malay arts and restrictions on women performing in public in the northeastern state of kelantan, which is governed by pas. prime minister najib has projected a global image of a moderate muslim leader and has widely promoted himself as a key player in the fight against islamic extremism. in a meeting with u.s. president donald trump last month, najib said malaysia is a partner in america s fight against the islamic state, and it will be a key player in promoting moderate islam. he has been largely silent during a series of recent religion related incidents in malaysia. he did, though, comment this week after the owner of a laundromat in southern malaysia apologized for barring non muslim users, a ban that had gone viral on social media and triggered condemnations by community leaders, including the sultan of johor.  the government will remain committed to upholding the true islamic teachings while protecting the interests of the other communities as demanded of islam,  najib said in a statement late on wednesday, state news agency bernama reported. cynthia gabriel, executive director for a kuala lumpur based welfare group c4, said there is an urgent need to accept multi culturalism again.  it is bad for society, so it is bad for business, when two sets of laws and policies operate in one country,  she said.

" four u.s. senators have asked the senate judiciary committee to launch an investigation into a deal drugmaker allergan plc (agn.n) struck with a native american tribe to protect some of its patents from generic challenge, according to a letter seen by reuters. democrats maggie hassan, sherrod brown, bob casey and richard blumenthal in the letter to judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley and ranking member dianne feinstein on wednesday called allergan’s deal “a blatantly anti competitive attempt to shield its patents from review and keep drug prices high.” allergan said on sept. 8 that it was transferring patents on its dry eye medication restasis to upstate new york’s saint regis mohawk tribe, which agreed to exclusively license them back to the company in exchange for ongoing payments. allergan said in an emailed response to a reuters request for comment that it met last week with the staffs of senators brown and hassan to provide detailed briefings on the agreement. “we would welcome the opportunity to provide additional briefings for these senators, as well as the opportunity to brief senators casey and blumenthal, and answer any questions they may have,” allergan said in the email.  the tribe and company have said that the tribe’s sovereign status shields the patents from review by the u.s. patent trial and appeal board, an administrative court empowered to invalidate patents. on friday, the tribe asserted this immunity in an ongoing administrative proceeding brought by generic drugmakers led by mylan nv (myl.o), which are seeking to invalidate allergan’s patents to introduce cheaper versions of restasis to the market.  mylan has called allergan’s deal with the tribe a “sham transaction” and said the tribe should not be allowed to invoke immunity to prevent administrative review. some patent lawyers have noted that the patent board has recognized the immunity of state entities like public universities, and tribal immunity is considered to be an even stronger shield. generic drug companies often seek to challenge brand name drug patents through administrative proceedings, which are cheaper and faster than federal court litigation. allergan has said it would not invoke the tribe’s immunity in federal court.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump won a legal battle on sunday when a u.s. appeals court in ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that democrats had sought to prevent election day voter intimidation. the rules overturned by the sixth circuit court of appeals would have imposed greater penalties on people who harass voters during tuesday’s election. voter intimidation already is prohibited under u.s. law but democrats have pushed for greater restrictions in ohio and five other battleground states, citing concerns that trump’s heated rhetoric might inspire election day chaos. on the campaign trail, trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. numerous studies have found that u.s. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  on friday u.s. district court judge james gwin imposed new restrictions on those who monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go. those found to violate the rules could be held in contempt of court. the trump campaign had argued that those restrictions were not justified, given that there had been no reported instances of voter harassment in the state so far.  “in the end, plaintiff’s case rested on rhetoric, not evidence,” trump attorney chad readler wrote in a court filing on saturday. the appeals court sided with trump, lifting the new rules two days before election day. the ruling came before democrats had a chance to respond to readler’s motion and the party said it may appeal. “we are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the sixth circuit has done in this decision. we are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling,” ohio democratic party spokeswoman kirstin alvanitakis said. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" neutral switzerland is prepared to act as a mediator to help resolve the north korea crisis, including by hosting ministerial talks, swiss president doris leuthard said on monday. leuthard said swiss troops were deployed on the demarcation zone between south korea and north korea and noted that her country   along with sweden   had a long history of neutral and discreet diplomacy. this has included switzerland representing u.s. interests in both iran and cuba.  but china and the united states had to take their share of responsibility, she added, warning against  over reactions  after the north s sixth and largest nuclear test. sanctions  did not change many things  in terms of convincing pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs, even though its population had suffered, leuthard said.  i think it really is time for dialogue,  she told a news conference in berne.  we are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. i think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the u.s. and china can have an influence in this crisis. that s why i think switzerland and sweden can have a role behind the curtain.  part of the task would be to find a suitable location for officials   perhaps the countries  foreign ministers   to meet, she said.  i think that s our role, to look at what kind of possibilities we find. because, well, twitter won t be an adequate instrument... this must be very discreet.  noting that the communist party congress in north korea s neighbor and ally china was due to take place in october,  leuthard said the time for such initiatives was not ideal, so  perhaps this was also part of the plan of north korea.  north korean leader kim jong un spent part of his youth in berne studying under an assumed name. a framework agreement between north korea and the united states, under the clinton administration, was clinched in 1994 in geneva after long negotiations. the deal by which pyongyang was to freeze construction of its nuclear reactors, suspected of being part of its covert weapons program, in exchange for two light water nuclear reactors, unraveled in 2003.  north korea is a worrying situation. we are a small country. perhaps they could meet in switzerland to find a political solution, not one with arms,  leuthard said.

" president barack obama’s white house set up one last fight with the republican controlled congress over defense spending on monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day to day military programs. the house of representatives draft of the $602 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, which sets spending policy for the department of defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime overseas contingency operations, or oco, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs. the obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens u.s. security and unfairly spares the pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education. “by gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep america safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies,” the white house said in a statement. house republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in afghanistan and against islamic state militants in iraq and syria. the obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at guantanamo bay in cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in iraq and syria. obama vetoed one version of the 2016 ndaa over its use of oco funding and the guantanamo restrictions. he later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the guantanamo measures in place. it will be months before the legislation passes congress and arrives on obama’s desk. the house draft has passed the house armed services committee, and republican leaders would like a vote by the full house as soon as wednesday. however, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. the rules committee was meeting late on monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote. the senate is also drafting its version of the ndaa, which must be reconciled with the house’s before being subject to vote in both chambers. if passed, that version would be sent to the white house for obama’s signature, or veto.

" the united states must consider the full threat it says iran poses to the middle east when formulating its new policy toward tehran, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday, adding that iran had breached the spirit of a 2015 nuclear deal.  tillerson, made the comments during a visit to britain to see prime minister theresa may and foreign minister boris johnson. the trip was billed as focusing on the relief effort after hurricane irma, how to respond to north korea s nuclear test, and resolving the political deadlock in libya. but he was outspoken in his criticism of iran when asked whether he believed it was meeting the obligations of a 2015 international nuclear agreement designed to curb an iranian nuclear program in return for lifting most western sanctions. tillerson cited the preface of the nuclear deal, which calls on iran to contribute positively to regional security.   in our view, iran is clearly in default of these expectations ... through their actions to prop up the assad regime (in syria), to engage in malicious activities in the region, including cyber activities, aggressively developing ballistic missiles,  he told a news conference.  we have to consider the totality of iran s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement.  he was speaking before the united states announced it had imposed sanctions on seven iranian individuals and two entities, alleging involvement in either malicious cyber activities or enabling tehran s ballistic missile program. u.s. president donald trump has previously expressed doubts about the nuclear deal, and in april his administration said it would review whether the lifting of sanctions against iran was in the united states  national security interest. trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive u.s. responses to iran s forces, its shi ite muslim proxies in iraq and syria, and its support for militant groups. earlier on thursday, a north korean state agency threatened to reduce the united states to  ashes and darkness  for supporting a u.n. security council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. tillerson said he was hopeful that china would decide to use the  powerful tool  of oil supplies to put pressure on pyongyang, but conceded that it would be difficult to agree an oil embargo through the united nations security council. north korea carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month.  i am hopeful that china, as a great country, a world power, will decide on their own, will take it upon themselves to use that very powerful tool of oil supply to persuade north korea to reconsider its current path towards weapons development, reconsider its approach to dialogue and negotiations in the future,  he said. commenting on violence in myanmar against the minority rohingya population, tillerson said the country faced a defining moment.  i think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.  this violence must stop, this persecution must stop.  he said he understood that myanmar s aung san suu kyi, a nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in myanmar, was in a power sharing agreement with the military and it was a  complex situation  in which she found herself.

" i first visited camp no. 3 a few days after the sept. 19 earthquake.  after reporting from collapsed buildings around the city, this was a different type of shock. row after row of tiny tin shacks crammed into a small lot hidden behind a high fence in the middle class neighborhood of lindavista. here, hundreds of families who lost their homes in an earthquake 32 years ago are living in deplorable conditions, with children and grandchildren born during the interminable wait for promised government subsidized homes. the 1985 earthquake was a defining moment for the mexican capital. the death toll is still disputed, but at least 5,000 were killed. some say many more died. three decades on, hundreds of its victims are still living in hovels in encampments across the sprawling city of 20 million and now the latest quake has made thousands more people homeless. on first impression the camp is a little menacing, the smell of marijuana hangs in the air and residents warn of thieves and petty crime they blame on new arrivals   people who have moved in to occupy shacks left by families who have received new homes.  a strong sense of community prevails among the 1985 earthquake survivors, necessary perhaps for families who share outdoor toilets and use bared electric cables to heat water to bathe. and as i have seen among many of latin america s poorest people, there is resourcefulness. most families had some kind of work, many setting up small businesses like food stands selling tacos, or makeshift photocopy shops on the roadside.  one woman made her living charging for toilet paper and access to a bathroom.  according to the leaders of the lindavista camp, its ramshackle shacks are home to around 750 people, divided into roughly 250 families. there are almost 200 children who are the grandchildren of those originally resettled here, according to local leaders. at least six such camps exist in the capital. mexico city s housing institute said that since 2016, it has delivered 173 homes to victims of the 1985 quake and expects to hand over 120 more before the end of next year. click on reut.rs/2go1os4 for related photo essay ",0
" texas governor greg abbott on friday gave $50 million to houston to help cover costs related to hurricane harvey, a move the mayor said will allow the city to avoid a temporary property tax hike that was up for a city council vote in october. mayor sylvester turner, who accepted the money from the republican governor at a city hall press conference, said he will pull his proposal for a one year tax increase to cover the city’s share of debris removal expenses and for insurance related payments. parts of houston suffered severe wind and flood damage after hurricane harvey made landfall on aug. 25. it was the strongest hurricane to hit texas in more than 50 years. earlier this week, abbott rejected turner’s request for the state to immediately tap its $10 billion rainy day fund to aid its largest city. on friday, the governor said he had the flexibility to withdraw $50 million from a state disaster relief fund for houston. “this looked like the best solution at this point,” abbott told reporters. he added that once the state gets a handle on total hurricane expenses, the texas legislature will consider tapping into the rainy day fund when its next regular session begins in january 2019 or sooner in a special session.

" at a town hall in his conservative florida district this week, u.s. representative ted yoho drew applause for defying his own republican party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was president donald trump’s first major legislative initiative. far from paying a price back home, as trump has threatened they would, yoho and some of the other far right members of the house freedom caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two week congressional recess. a handful of house freedom caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month’s defeat of trump’s effort to repeal and replace obamacare, which was also rejected by some republican moderates. many supporters made clear they expect them to work with trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation’s health care system. “i want it done,” said bob white, 74, after questioning yoho on the issue during a town hall on tuesday night in rural putnam county, florida. “wield that big stick.”  the rebellious faction of conservatives in the house of representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by trump to rewrite obamacare, president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. trump has singled out the group for blame. many caucus members refused to back the republican leadership’s bill because they considered parts too similar to obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. at town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs. the reception for yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of congress, said matthew green, an associate professor of politics at catholic university of america, who studies congressional parties and leaders. “the freedom caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents ‘good job,’” he said. “or if they don’t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.” michigan representative justin amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a white house adviser called on twitter for trump supporters to defeat him in a primary. but in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker kellogg co, the four term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in battle creek, michigan on tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending. “if i had to choose between justin and trump, i’d go with justin for sure,” said construction worker eric smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found trump lacking conservative principles. “at this point, i’d give donald trump a d.”  retiree cliff ward, 72, told amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions. “now we need you to work with trump and the other republicans to get this done,” he added.     living in georgetown, florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, trump voter melvin shebester knew little about the house freedom caucus. the faction of small government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream republican leadership in the house, including an attempt to push out former republican house speaker john boehner. the 84 year old shebester was impressed that his congressman, yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed. “it takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,” said shebester, attending yoho’s town hall on tuesday night at a government center in palatka, florida with his son and grandson. “we can’t go up there and tell trump he’s wrong,” added his son, steven shebester, 56, who lives nearby.      many republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.  but yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. his event in gainesville, a college town, on monday was crowded by left leaning activists who at times shouted him down. on tuesday night in palatka, a small town in yoho’s sprawling district in north central florida lined with oaks and spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd. he told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. and a phone survey of constituents found the republican plan was as unpopular as obamacare itself. he said constituents gave him a clear message: “stay the course.” (this version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph) ",0
" arms provided by the united states and saudi arabia to syrian opposition groups frequently ended up in the hands of islamic state, an arms monitoring group that analyzed weapons found on the battlefield said on thursday. conflict armament research (car) said most islamic state weapons were looted from the iraqi and syrian armies. but some were originally provided by other countries, mainly the united states and saudi arabia, to syrian opposition groups fighting against president bashar al assad.  these findings are a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non state armed groups operate,  the group said in a 200 page report. car documented at least 12 cases of weaponry purchased by the united states that ended up in islamic state s hands, either captured on the battlefield or acquired through shifting alliances within the syrian opposition. most of these items later ended up in iraq, the monitor said. in one case, it took only two months for islamic state fighters in iraq to get their hands on a guided anti tank missile the united states bought from a european country and supplied to a syrian opposition group. all of the items were made in eu states, and in most cases the united states broke contractual clauses prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapons to armed groups in syria.  evidence collected by car indicates that the united states has repeatedly diverted eu manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the syrian conflict. is forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this materiel.  car said it similarly traced numerous items used by islamic state back to exports from bulgaria to saudi arabia, and that these were also subject to non retransfer clauses that should have barred them from being supplied to syrian warring parties. around 90 percent of weapons and ammunition used by islamic state in syria and iraq were made in china, russia, and eastern european countries, car said, with china and russia alone accounting for over 50 percent.  these findings support widespread assumptions that the group initially captured much of its military materiel from iraqi and syrian government forces,  the report said. russian made weapons used by islamic state in syria outnumbered chinese ones,  presumably reflecting russian supplies to the syrian regime,  car said. russia is allied with assad and launched air strikes in syria in september 2015, its biggest middle east intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. on saturday iraq declared final victory over islamic state, which seized more than a third of the country s territory in 2014. last week russia declared victory over the group in syria. car reported last year that islamic state had been making its own weapons on a scale and with sophistication matching national military forces, and that it had standardized production across its realm. link to the car report: here ",0

" croatia aims to become a euro zone member within the next seven to eight years, prime minister andrej plenkovic said on monday.  we don t want to specify the exact dates, but we want croatia to become a euro zone member within two government terms in office,  plenkovic told an economic conference devoted to the introduction of the euro in croatia. the centre right government came to power a year ago. plenkovic said croatia wanted to enter the european exchange rate mechanism ii (erm 2) within the next three years, before the country takes the presidency of the european union in 2020. eu members that have not yet adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in erm ii, a mechanism aimed to ensure currency stability before joining the euro zone. the croatian central bank already keeps croatia s kuna currency in a narrow fluctuation band, roughly at between 7.3 and 7.7 to the euro, occasionally intervening on the local foreign exchange market mostly to ease appreciation pressures. croatia s major challenge before adopting the euro is expected to be the reduction of public debt which is slightly above 80 percent of gross domestic product.  our goal is to reduce the public debt to 72 percent of gdp by 2020 ... we are undertaking a major fiscal consolidation and this year the budget gap will be even lower than last year s 0.9 percent of gdp,  plenkovic said. central bank governor boris vujcic said croatia was the most  euroised  eu country of those that had not yet adopted the euro.  some 75 percent of local deposits and 67 percent of local debt is denominated in the euro. some 60 percent of croatia s trade exchange is related to the euro zone, while 70 percent of tourism receipts comes from the euro zone countries,  vujcic told the conference. the most important benefits of euro adoption would be the removal of currency risk and lower interest rates, he said. croatia took an obligation to adopt the euro when it joined the eu in 2013, but without a defined timetable. vujcic said any fears among the population about prices soaring when the euro is adopted could be tackled by an obligation to display prices in both kunas and euros six months before an agreed euro zone entry date.

" u.n. special envoy for syria staffan de mistura urged russia on wednesday to convince its ally the syrian government of the need to clinch a peace deal to end the nearly seven year old war. de mistura, speaking on swiss television station rts, said  failure to make peace quickly through united nations mediation could lead to  a fragmentation of syria . russian president vladimir putin during a surprise visit on monday to russia s hmeymim air base in syria, declared that the work of russian forces was largely done in backing the assad government against militants, following the defeat of  the most battle hardened group of international terrorists.  de mistura, asked what signal putin could give from his position of force, said:  convince the (syrian) government that there is no time to lose.... you can think you win territory militarily but you have to win the peace.  and to win the peace, you have to have the courage to push the government to accept that there has to be a new constitution and new elections, through the united nations,  he said. the nearly seven year civil war in syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. all previous diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure over the opposition s demand that president bashar al assad leave power and his refusal to go. the kremlin first launched air strikes in syria in september 2015 in its biggest middle east intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in assad s favor.  now that it regards that mission complete, putin wants to help broker a peace deal and is keen to organize a special event in russia   a syrian congress on national dialogue   that moscow hopes will bring together the syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution. but de mistura made clear that peace negotiations must be through the united nations in geneva, as mandated by the u.n. security council, adding:  otherwise it is not worth it.... this is a complicated war, it is only in geneva through the u.n.  the u.n. envoy has conducted shuttle diplomacy between the syrian government delegation led by chief negotiator bashar al ja afari and a unified opposition delegation.  the opposition told me clearly when they arrived here, and again yesterday and this morning too, that they are ready to meet the government right away to have a hard, difficult discussion.  the government is not ready, it has said it is not ready to meet the opposition. that is regrettable but diplomacy has many means,  de mistura said. a senior western diplomat said that the government delegation had failed to engage with de mistura on a new constitution and elections during a round of negotiations due to end on thursday.  clearly they did not have any intention to engage in this political process. and clearly they are not under sufficient pressure to do so,  the diplomat told reuters.  the clear impression is the regime wants to avoid the u.n. led political process at any cost.

" a computer network used by democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told reuters. the latest attack, which was disclosed to reuters on friday, follows two other hacks on the democratic national committee, or dnc, and the party’s fundraising committee for candidates for the u.s. house of representatives. a clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on friday that an analytics data program maintained by the dnc and used by the campaign and a number of other entities “was accessed as part of the dnc hack.” “our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. to date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,” said clinton campaign spokesman nick merrill. later, a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics program’s server for approximately five days. the analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis, and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers, the official said. the u.s. department of justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on democratic political organizations threatened u.s. security, sources familiar with the matter said on friday. the involvement of the justice department’s national security division is a sign that the obama administration has concluded that the hacking was sponsored by a state, people with knowledge of the investigation said. while it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to, the third such attack on sensitive democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond, just over three months before the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. hackers, whom u.s. intelligence officials have concluded were russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising democratic congressional campaign committee, or dccc, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to reuters for the first time. cyber security experts and u.s. officials said earlier this week they had concluded, based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the dnc hack, that russia engineered the release of hacked democratic party emails to influence the u.s. presidential election. the u.s. federal bureau of investigation said on friday it was “aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters.” “the fbi takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” the agency said in an emailed statement. the hack did not involve the private email system clinton used while she was secretary of state. yahoo news reported on thursday night that the fbi had warned the clinton campaign last march that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation, but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive. a source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to reuters.  the new disclosure to reuters that hackers gained access to the full dccc network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support democratic candidates in campaigns for the house. the hack of the dccc, which is based in washington, was reported first by reuters on thursday, ahead of clinton’s speech in philadelphia accepting the democratic party’s nomination. russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. several u.s. officials said the obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to russia as that might undermine secretary of state john kerry’s effort to win russian cooperation in the war on islamic state in syria. the officials said the administration fears russian president vladimir putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on u.s. targets, increasing military harassment of u.s. and allied aircraft and warships in the baltic and black seas, and making more aggressive moves in eastern europe. some officials question the approach, arguing that responding more forcefully to russia would be more effective than remaining silent. the obama administration announced in an april 2015 executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks.  the hack on the dnc, made public in june, led to wikileaks publishing more than 19,000 emails last weekend, some of them showing favoritism within the dnc for clinton over u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont. dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz resigned on sunday as a result, creating a rocky start for the party’s convention in philadelphia this week. republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday invited russia to dig up thousands of “missing” emails from clinton’s time at the state department, prompting democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on americans. on thursday, trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm. earlier in the week, clinton campaign senior policy adviser jake sullivan had criticized trump and called the hacking “a national security issue.” trump campaign spokesman jason miller said on friday the reported breach showed cyber security is “a problem wherever hillary clinton goes. hopefully this time there wasn’t classified or top secret information that puts american lives at risk.” in washington, the dccc said early on friday it had hired cyber security firm crowdstrike to investigate. “we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,” the dccc said. “we are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.” the dccc had no additional comment late on friday. officials at the dnc did not respond to requests for comment.  senator dianne feinstein, a california democrat and the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee, told cnn on friday she had not heard about the hack of the clinton campaign. but she said: “it wouldn’t surprise me. i think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that there’s a problem out there. everybody should be cautious.” ",0
" a leniency deal struck between the controlling shareholders of brazilian meatpacker jbs sa and prosecutors may be partially revoked, threatening witnesses  immunity but keeping their testimony, the country s top prosecutor said on monday. prosecutor general rodrigo janot said at a news conference that billionaire meat tycoon joesley batista and a fellow state s witness seemed to have inadvertently recorded a four hour conversation discussing crimes not covered in their plea bargain. the audio was submitted to prosecutors on thursday as an attachment to an unrelated matter, he said. joesley batista and his brother wesley previously confessed to bribing scores of politicians in plea bargain testimony that allowed them to avoid prosecution. with their help, prosecutors got a recording of president michel temer apparently endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in a graft probe. janot said the new audio was  very troubling  because it suggested the batistas had not been forthcoming about all of their crimes. he also said the audio implicated someone at the supreme court of unspecified wrongdoing and suggested that a prosecutor in his office had aided the batistas illegally. janot said evidence from their plea bargain testimony, which he has used to bring corruption charges against temer, will stand regardless of whether witnesses lose immunity after an investigation of the new audio. the prosecutor general is expected to bring a second wave of charges against temer in coming weeks. questions about the batistas  testimony are likely to hang over the charges against temer, making it easier for members of congress to prevent the president from facing trial at the supreme court, as they did with earlier charges. temer declined to comment on the matter when asked by reporters in china. j&f investimentos sa, the holding company through which the batista family controls jbs, said janot had hastily interpreted the recording, which contained  considerations of hypotheses  and did not compromise the good faith of the witnesses. the company agreed in may to pay a leniency fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.3 billion) for its role in a political bribery scheme. since then, joesley batista resigned as chairman of jbs, but his brother wesley remains chief executive and has been fighting efforts to remove him led by state development bank bndes, another major shareholder in the world s largest meatpacker. janot opened an investigation on monday into revising the leniency deals of joesley batista and two other j&f executives, according to a document on his office s website. since the plea deal, j&f has been racing to sell assets in order to reduce debt and pay the leniency fine. in three months, the holding company has signed agreements to sell havaianas flip flops maker alpargatas sa, dairy company vigor alimentos sa and pulpmaker eldorado brasil celulose sa.

" the german military s procurement agency has 1,300 unfilled jobs, accounting for about 20 percent of its entire workforce, a report by the defence ministry showed on wednesday, putting further strains on an already troubled acquisition system. the gaps affect mainly high level jobs in the technical and military sectors, which means the situation will remain problematic for the medium  to long term, necessitating continued use of external consulting firms, the report said. lack of qualified personnel affects the processing of complex weapons programs, many of which have run into delays in recent years in the wake of reforms instituted by defence minister ursula von der leyen after she took office in 2013.  use of external support services should not be understood as the beginning of a long term solution, but as an efficient tool to bridge the time until personnel changes can fully take effect,  the report said. von der leyen kicked off reforms to improve the transparency and efficacy of the military acquisition system, but critics say the changes have complicated the process and resulted in delays. the ministry failed to sign contracts for two of the biggest programs, a new missile defense system and the mks180 warship, during von der leyen s first tenure in the job. the ministry did sign a contract for five new corvettes, but faced criticism for awarding the contract without a competition. von der leyen had argued that no competition was needed since the ships were follow on orders for an existing design. separately, a ministry spokesman said at sea testing of the new f125 frigate built by thyssenkrupp  and privately held luerssen, would be delayed due to unexpected repairs. the first new f125 frigate was now expected to enter into service in early 2018 instead of december, the spokesman said. thyssenkrupp said delays could happen with any complicated weapons program, but the ship was still expected to be delivered to the german military next year. the first of the four new f125 warships, slated to cost 650 million euros each, was initially slated to enter service in 2014.

" the u.s. federal communications commission said thursday it will take up a proposal this month to revise its rules to allow law enforcement personnel to identify threatening callers, following a series of threatening calls to jewish community centers. in march, the fcc granted an emergency temporary waiver to jewish community centers and telecommunications carriers that serve them to help track down callers who have made threats by unmasking phone numbers used to call in threats. fcc rules generally require phone companies to respect a calling party’s request to have caller id information blocked from the party receiving the call. jewish community centers and schools in at least 13 u.s. states reported receiving bomb threats this year, stoking fears of a resurgence of anti semitism. the “episode raised the question of whether we need to make permanent changes to our rules,” fcc chairman ajit pai said in a blog post thursday. the fcc will “consider a proposal to change the rules to ensure that all threatened parties and associated law enforcement personnel have quick access to the information they need to identify and thwart threatening callers,” he added. in april, prosecutors identified an israeli american teenager accused of making dozens of bomb threats to jewish community centers in separate criminal complaints filed in u.s. federal courts in florida and georgia that linked him to hundreds of threatening calls in 2015 and 2017. michael ron david kadar, 18, a dual u.s. israeli citizen who is jewish and lives in israel, made at least 245 threatening telephone calls between jan. 4 and march 7 this year, many targeting jewish community centers in the united states, according to the florida complaint. the fcc has only rarely granted waivers to access caller information. in 2015, the middletown school district in new york state was inundated by phone calls making terrorism threats from anonymous numbers. following the calls, then fcc chairman tom wheeler approved a special waiver in 2016 to access the caller information of the individuals making the threats.

" a republican led senate panel backed away from a plan to restrict media cameras in parts of the u.s. capitol on tuesday after democrats and some republicans criticized the move as an attempt to curtail press access. senate staff who manage press access told television network reporters earlier tuesday that they could no longer film interviews with senators in the hallways of the capitol without first receiving permission, citing a directive from the senate committee on rules and administration.  such interviews, an everyday occurrence in designated areas throughout the capitol, provide a running insight into legislators’ thoughts on bills and hearings. the staff said the restrictions were because the number of reporters has swelled due to negotiations on healthcare legislation and high profile hearings. the directive came from the senate rules committee, which oversees operations on the senate side of the capitol, they said. the panel is controlled by republicans, since they hold the majority in the senate. committee chairman richard shelby said in a statement the panel was simply enforcing rules already on the books, adding it “has been working with the various galleries to ensure compliance with existing rules in an effort to help provide a safe environment.”  the senior democrat on the panel, amy klobuchar, said she was not consulted in advance and objected. in a statement, klobuchar said she called on republicans “to allow reporters to do their jobs.” she added that she had talked to shelby, who had told her he would not move to change press access without consulting her. “we must hold him to it. this is no time for limiting press access in the u.s. senate — with russia hearings, attorney general (jeff) sessions testifying, and what appears to be the secretive drafting of a healthcare bill. we have to preserve freedom of the press,” she said. shelby’s office did not respond to a request to discuss the dispute over media access except to provide his prepared statement. a senate aide, who asked not to be identified, said that  rules committee members were “looking to make changes and have backed off for now.” “we’re certainly not trying to deny anybody an opportunity to have questions asked,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said during a press conference, referring reporters back to the rules committee for detailed guidance. the capitol hallways have been crowded with both reporters and summer tourists in recent weeks as senate republicans work on an overhaul of the u.s. healthcare system. current and former government officials have also drawn crowds at hearings related to probes into alleged russian meddling in last year’s presidential election.

" a congressional committee led by evangelical christians has voted to ban abortion in brazil in all situations, including cases of rape and where the mother s life is in danger. the decision was voted 18 1 late on wednesday by a special committee considering a constitutional amendment to extend maternity leave for mothers of premature babies. the single vote against the ban was cast by the only woman present during the session, erika kokay of the workers party, who called the decision a maneuver by the committee s pro life evangelical majority. abortion is illegal in predominantly catholic brazil except when the pregnancy is the result of a rape or puts the mother s life at risk. in 2012, the supreme court authorized the abortion on fetuses with anencephaly. more than one million abortions are carried out at clandestine clinics each year in brazil and thousands of women end up in hospital as a result of botched procedures, according to government estimates. but even the limited circumstances where abortions are legal have been targeted by a growing evangelical caucus in congress that has led to a conservative trend in lawmaking on social issues.  to defend abortion, like it or not, is a satanic, diabolical and destructive act,  evangelical congressman pastor eurico told the committee, brandishing a replica of a 12 week old fetus. the move to criminalize all cases of abortion would require  supermajorities, or two thirds of the votes in both chambers of congress, as it is part of a constitutional amendment. the measure could clear those hurdles as part of a trade off for other legislation the governing coalition seeks to pass, such as pension reform needed to plug a gaping budget deficit.

" britain said on monday that comments by foreign secretary boris johnson about jailed iranian british aid worker nazanin zaghari ratcliffe should not be used by the islamic republic to bring additional charges against her. johnson told the british parliament s foreign affairs committee last wednesday that zaghari ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism, a statement that the thomson reuters foundation, a charity organization for which she works, said was incorrect.  last week s remarks by the foreign secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against nazanin zaghari ratcliffe,  a spokesman for the british foreign office said.  while criticizing the iranian case against mrs zaghari ratcliffe, the foreign secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment.  zaghari ratcliffe, a project manager, is serving a five year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment. she was brought again into court on saturday, three days after johnson s remarks, and accused by a judge of  spreading propaganda against the regime .  she is not a journalist and has never trained journalists at the thomson reuters foundation where she is project manager in my media development team,  monique villa, thomson reuters foundation chief executive, said in a statement.  i see a direct correlation between this statement by boris johnson, who rightly condemned the treatment that nazanin has received in iran, and the fact that nazanin was brought once again into court on saturday 4 november.  the charges against nazanin were denied by her family and the foundation, a charity organization that is independent of thomson reuters and operates independently of reuters news. tulip siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition labour party, said johnson had failed to retract his comments, which she said had undermined efforts to secure zaghari ratcliffe s release.  by suggesting nazanin was in iran  teaching people journalism , boris johnson has endangered the cause to secure her release,  siddiq, who is the lawmaker for the area where zaghari ratcliffe lived in london, said in an emailed statement.  the foreign secretary s failure to retract his comments to the foreign affairs select committee is unforgivable,  siddiq said.  his comments were both untrue and unhelpful to her case.  the iranian embassy in london could not be reached for comment.

" republican congressman will hurd   whose district spans 800 miles (1,290 km) of the texas mexico border   on friday criticized plans under consideration by the trump administration to build walls and fences costing an estimated $21.6 billion to deter illegal immigration.  reuters on thursday revealed details of an internal report by the department of homeland security (dhs) that estimated the cost of covering the entire border. it called for the first phase of construction to begin in san diego, california; el paso, texas and the rio grande valley. “building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border,” hurd, whose district includes el paso, said in an email. he said his district includes rough terrain where “it is impossible to build a physical wall.” the estimated price tag in the report is much higher than a $12 billion figure cited by republican president donald trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from republican house speaker paul ryan and republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. the border wall was one of trump’s main campaign promises. trump, who took office on jan. 20, has vowed to make mexico pay for it, but the united states’ southern neighbor has repeatedly said it will not fund its construction. many congressional democrats reacted strongly to the news of plans for the wall and its estimated price.  senator patrick leahy of vermont, the senior democrat on the senate appropriations committee, said in a telephone interview that he welcomed the debate in his committee over funding the wall.  “instead of funding this costly and ineffective proxy for real action on immigration reform, we should be directing our resources toward finding cures for cancer, building schools for our children, feeding the hungry and rebuilding our bridges and our roads,” leahy said. five democratic senators on friday wrote a letter to homeland security secretary john kelly claiming that the money would be misspent.  the letter was signed by senators kamala harris of california, martin heinrich of new mexico, tom udall of new mexico, brian schatz of hawaii and elizabeth warren of massachusetts. warren, a star of the political left, was silenced in the republican controlled senate on tuesday evening for speaking out against trump’s  attorney general nominee, republican senator jeff sessions. sessions was confirmed on wednesday.  the senators wrote, “we are extraordinarily concerned that president trump’s executive order appears to require that you divert dhs funds meant for critical security priorities to instead fund the border wall.” they asked that kelly respond to a series of questions, including how much funding will be diverted to cover costs for building the wall. hurd said he had seen estimates as high as $40 billion for the barrier’s construction, citing a massachusetts institute of technology study released in october.

" iran s president said on thursday its nuclear accord with world powers cannot be renegotiated, after the trump administration warned it was weighing whether the deal signed by its predecessor served u.s. security interests. under the 2015 deal, iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions. u.s. president donald trump called the deal an  embarrassment  during his first speech at the united nations on tuesday.  there was some discussion by some people that the nuclear deal isn t very bad but shouldn t stay as it is. (that) it s a deal that s good but we should sit down again and debate to see if it can be improved. if it has flaws we can fix them,  iranian president hassan rouhani said.  they were told clearly and definitively (by us) that the nuclear deal cannot be renegotiated,  he told a press conference in tehran broadcast live on state television after his return from the u.n. general assembly. trump told reporters this week he had made a decision on what to do about the agreement, approved by his predecessor barack obama along with leaders of russia, china, britain, france and germany, but would not say what he had decided. however, although trump does not like the deal, his speech to the united nations on tuesday did not mean washington would withdraw from the pact, nikki haley, u.s. ambassador to the u.n., said on wednesday. the prospect of washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the u.s. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. if trump does not certify next month that iran is complying with the accord, the u.s. congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. u.n. inspectors have verified iranian compliance with the terms. in contrast with obama s policy of detente with iran after decades of mutual hostility, trump called iran  a corrupt dictatorship  on tuesday and accused it of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the middle east.  (trump) made big mistakes in this speech,  rouhani said.  there were baseless and unfounded accusations. it wasn t worthy of the united nations or an individual who sees himself as the president of a country.  iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, the highest authority in the islamic republic, also criticized trump during a meeting thursday with the assembly of experts, a body tasked with choosing the next supreme leader.   this speech was not a sign of power but rather a sign of anger, frustration and stupidity,  khamenei said, according to a report on his official website. in recent months, tensions have ramped up between iran and the united states in the gulf, with both sides accusing each other of provocative naval maneuvers.

" european parliamentarians want britain to end  regrettable  practices that discriminate against eu citizens in the workplace and elsewhere, a draft resolution published on thursday showed.  lawmakers also urged british authorities to grant broad rights to eu citizens and their families in britain after it exits the eu in 2019, an issue where eu chief negotiator michel barnier said on thursday big differences remained. the european parliament  expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against eu citizens living in the united kingdom , the draft resolution said.  lawmakers said there were also cases of british citizens discriminated against in other eu countries. the british government said on sept. 9 that its equalities office (geo) was  aware of, and is looking into, reports of discrimination against non uk eu nationals seeking employment  in violation of the 2010 equality act. the document, agreed on thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties, will be voted on by the chamber next week in strasbourg. the document is not binding on eu negotiators but the 28 nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with britain on its future relations with the eu. mps also urged britain to protect the rights of eu citizens and their children even if they are born there after brexit.  future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members,  the document said. eu lawmakers have opposed britain s proposals to create a new category of  settled status  under united kingdom immigration law for eu citizens. differences on these issues remain, barnier said on thursday at the end of a fourth round of brexit negotiations. without sufficient progress on citizens  rights, the eu will not move on to negotiations on a future trade deal with london.

" the texas house of representatives gave preliminary approval on tuesday to a new bill on showing identification when voting after a previous voter id law was struck down by u.s. courts which said it discriminated against black and hispanic people. the measure called senate bill 5 is intended to remedy flaws found by courts in the previous republican backed law. it allows people who cannot produce an authorized photo id to show other documentation such as a utility bill or bank statement and sign an affidavit stating that they had a reasonable impediment in presenting an authorized id. critics contend the measure backed by the republican dominated lawmakers will still exclude ethnic minorities, who tend to support democrats, and imposes harsh penalties of up to 10 years in prison for lying on the affidavit. texas is the most populous republican controlled state. for more than 20 years, the party has won every statewide race for offices such as governor or u.s. senator. but shifting demographics have given hopes to democrats that they can one day turn the state to their column, which would alter the u.s. political landscape.  the original voter id measure was signed into law in 2011 by then texas governor rick perry, a republican. it was considered one of the nation’s strictest and has been subject to years of court challenges, with the laws opponents saying it could exclude up to 600,000 voters. in january, the u.s. supreme court declined to hear an appeal by texas seeking to revive the state’s strict republican backed voter identification requirements. critics had said the texas law and similar statutes enacted in other republican governed states were tailored to make it harder for minorities including black and hispanic voters, who are less likely to have the authorized ids, to cast ballots. backers of these laws have said they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, despite little evidence of such fraud. both the previous law and the measure in the texas legislature list authorized photo id to include: a driver’s license, u.s. military id, a u.s. passport and a texas concealed handgun license. the texas senate approved sb 5 in march and on tuesday the state house of representatives preliminarily approved the measure. final votes on the bill may be held on wednesday, media reported.  texas used a similar system as outlined in the bill in the 2016 election after being ordered by a federal court to weaken its voter id law.

" about 20,000 israelis demonstrated in tel aviv on saturday against government corruption and prime minister benjamin netanyahu who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. the demonstration was by far the largest of weekly anti corruption protests sparked by corruption allegations against netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing.  the four term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases. the first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily. saturday s protest was prompted by a draft law expected to be ratified by parliament next week, which would bar police from publishing its findings in two investigations of netanyahu. a reuters cameraman and israeli media put the number of demonstrators at about 20,000. police would not provide an official estimate.  critics say the draft law is a blatant attempt to protect netanyahu and keep the public in the dark about his investigation. supporters of the legislation say it is meant to protect suspects  rights. netanyahu has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation but he has not ordered its two sponsors, close confidants in his likud party, to withdraw the bill. netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him:  there will be nothing because there is nothing.   if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate.

"elect trump’s transition team as well as the gang of eight, has called for a briefing for his entire committee on the cia assessment. “the committee is vigorously looking into reports of cyber attacks during the election campaign, and in particular we want to clarify press reports that the cia has a new assessment that it has not shared with us,” nunes said.representative ron johnson, chairman of the house homeland security committee, said his panel also has asked for a briefing but the cia refused. “it is disappointing that the cia would provide information on this issue to the washington post and nbc but will not provide information to elected members of congress,” johnson said in a statement on friday. three u.s. government sources, who all asked for anonymity to discuss classified information, told reuters that while the full congressional committees have not been briefed, the congressional leadership has, which is the standard procedure for briefing congress on sensitive intelligence. the sources said that nunes was personally briefed on the cia finding. a congressional official denied nunes was briefed, however. the office of the director of national intelligence (odni) said in a statement that because president barack obama last week ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full scale “review of foreign efforts to influence recent presidential elections – from 2008 to the present,” the agencies would not comment further until the study is completed. odni, which oversees all 16 u.s. intelligence agencies, said that when the review is complete, the u.s. intelligence community “stands ready to brief congress.” the office said it also would make the study “available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.” the cia based its conclusion about russia hacking to influence the election not on irrefutable evidence but largely on its analysis of the fact that the russians hacked both political parties while only publicizing information damaging to democrats and their presidential candidate, hillary clinton, said a u.s. official familiar with the agency’s work, who also requested anonymity. two of the government sources said on friday that the federal bureau of investigation now backs the cia assessment that the russian hacks were aimed at helping trump win. the odni also agrees with the assessment, all three government sources said. there was no immediate comment from the fbi. the fbi, which has responsibility for counterintelligence investigations inside the united states, initially did not endorse the cia’s finding because it did not meet the standards of evidence necessary to win a conviction in a u.s. court or identify individuals whose hacking violated american law, one source said.the debate over russian hacking also is opening a rift between trump and some republican members of congress. the president elect continues to dismiss the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that russian president vladimir putin directed the hacking. on friday, senator richard burr, republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee, announced his committee will conduct a review in the new year of u.s. intelligence on russian activities and its cyber activity more broadly. the review will include questioning of both obama and trump officials, “including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony,” burr said in a statement.

" argentina s previous government never asked interpol to drop arrest warrants against a group of iranians accused of bombing a jewish center, the ex head of the police agency said on wednesday, as the government proceeded with treason charges against the former president. former interpol chief ronald noble said in an email on wednesday that he wants to testify that the government of former president cristina fernandez did not ask to have the arrest warrants lifted as part of a  memorandum  she had with iran. if a judge allows noble to testify, the treason case filed this month against fernandez and 11 other top officials could crumble. she denies wrongdoing and calls the charge politically motivated. the arrest warrants  were not affected in their validity by the approval of the memorandum,  noble said in an email to a federal appeals court that was seen by reuters. the fernandez administration  always expressed its belief that the warrants should remain in effect,  the email said. the accusation that the fernandez government worked behind the scenes to clear the accused bombers of the amia jewish community center in order to improve trade between argentina and iran is at the heart of a charge of treason brought against fernandez.  she served as president for eight years before being succeeded by mauricio macri in 2015. others agreed that the treason charge against fernandez appeared questionable.  the indictment by judge claudio bonadio of former president fernandez, her foreign minister hector timerman, and 10 others, for  treason  and  concealment  points to no evidence that would seem to substantiate those charges,  human rights watch said in a statement on tuesday.  the allegations against fernandez drew international attention in january 2015, when the prosecutor who initially made them, alberto nisman, was found shot dead in the bathroom of his buenos aires apartment. an argentine appeals court ordered the re opening of the investigation a year ago. nisman s death was classified a suicide, though an official investigating the case has said the shooting appeared to be a homicide. nisman s body was discovered hours before he was to brief congress on the 1994 bombing of the amia center.  nisman said fernandez worked behind the scenes to clear iran of any wrongdoing and normalize relations to clinch a grains for oil deal with tehran that was signed in 2013. the  memorandum  agreement created a joint commission to investigate the amia bombing that critics said was really a means to absolve iran.

"the gop never ceases to amaze with its consistent insanity. this time the insanity has to do with the water contamination issue in flint, michigan. a michigan republican said that the flint water crisis may be overstated and another said that it s actually a  hoax.  l. brooks patterson, an oakland county executive said that the water crisis had been  vastly overstated. however, blood testing of flint s children has found dangerously high levels of lead after the cash strapped city stopped buying water from detroit and instead drew corrosive water from the flint river beginning in april, 2014. despite the tests, patterson is skeptical. he made the statement after  gop political analyst bill ballenger had opened a debate on the issue during a radio interview.  i think, well, that s the other side,  patterson said.  let s wait and see what the facts show. on the radio show, bill ballenger said that tests on his own blood had found no elevated levels of lead: this has been a vastly overblown crisis, perpetuated by a lot of politicians with an axe to grind and, for that matter, the news media, and some national figures, some political, some entertainers who don t know what they re talking about. i had my blood tested just yesterday, and i have no elevated blood-lead level   it s way down there. the idea that the entire population of flint has been poisoned and that we all have elevated blood-levels because of this is just a total canard. it s just a crock, and for this to be perpetuated as a story is doing a lot of damage to flint as a community. the evidence or lack of evidence cited in ballenger s rant has given patterson reason to doubt whether the children of flint, who don t have any access to fresh drinking water, were contaminated despite the tests that were done. patterson said that ballenger was  adamant that he lives in flint, he drinks the water, he showers in that water.  ballenger even described the water crisis as a  hoax. ballenger s evidence is at best anecdotal. whether he drank flint s water or not, it s children who are much more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. eden wells, michigan s chief medical executive, said that all children who drank the city s water since april of 2014 have been exposed to high levels of lead. that is at least 8,657 children. the long term effects of elevated blood levels can lead to many health complications: the long-term effects of elevated blood lead levels in children may include slow development, reduced intelligence quotient (iq) scores, learning disabilities, hearing loss, reduced height and hyperactivity. very severe lead exposure (blood lead levels greater than 80  g/dl) can cause coma, convulsions and even death. it boggles the mind that the republicans would rather talk about isis or repealing obamacare, while they dismiss an unfolding tragedy in an american city that s affecting thousands of american kids.feature image via screengrab",1
" nato has joined world powers  diplomatic efforts to stop north korea s missile program but it cannot yet rely on its u.s. built shield to defend europe, experts and diplomats said. the united states says the shield, more than a decade in the planning, is needed to protect against so called rogue states, a term u.s. officials have used to refer to north korea and iran.  but with berlin, paris and london potentially within striking distance of north korea s missiles from next year, officials say the u.s. led alliance s system needs more radars and special interceptors to destroy a rocket from pyongyang.  the nato shield in its current state lacks the reach and early warning radars to shoot down north korean rockets. it s a weak link,  said michael elleman, a missile defense analyst at the international institute for strategic studies (iiss).  early tracking is also difficult because north korean missiles would be flying over russia, where nato obviously cannot put radars,  he added. the sort of interceptor needed to shoot down north korean ballistic missiles could breach a soviet era arms control agreement between the united states and russia because of its greater range, arms experts say. moscow has long objected to u.s. missile shield plans, saying their real aim is to neutralize russia s own nuclear arsenal, rather than meet the perceived threat from  rogue states . russia s strategic concerns would, therefore, make it hard to renegotiate the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces (inf) treaty, something arms experts say would be required if a north korean missile shield were to be fully effective.  alliance planning to confront any threat from pyongyang is in its infancy. following north korea s country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3, two senior nato diplomats told reuters that protection against the north korean threat was only beginning to be considered at nato headquarters in brussels. that was despite a more forceful diplomatic tone on the crisis and warnings on the scale and immediacy of the threat from u.s. president donald trump s new ambassador to nato, france s defense minister and the alliance s deputy head. while analysts do not expect north korea to have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile until next year at the earliest, nato s european allies could become a target as a way of threatening their closest partner, the united states, a third nato diplomat said, stressing that was only speculation. the united states switched on its $800 million european missile defense umbrella in may last year at a site in romania to protect against iranian rockets.  the system, controlled from a nato base in germany, includes radars and interceptors stretching from eastern europe to the mediterranean.  a final site in poland should be ready by late 2018, extending the european umbrella from greenland and the azores.    to shoot down a ballistic missile from north korea would require a new generation of interceptor, the block ii, which is still in development. it is capable of downing ballistic rockets earlier and at a much higher altitude. however, elleman said that u.s. missile sites in alaska and california, as well as in japan and south korea, were likely to be given priority before europe, when they are ready in 2018.  there will be a lot of competition for the assets,  he said.

" president donald trump has selected joseph simons, an antitrust attorney from a washington law firm, to head the federal trade commission, a white house official said on wednesday. trump is expected to nominate simons to the agency, along with noah phillips and rohit chopra to be ftc commissioners, the white house official said. upon confirmation, simons will be designated chairman, the official said. the agency is currently headed by acting chairman maureen ohlhausen, a republican, with democrat terrell mcsweeny the only other commissioner. the president has long been expected to name a permanent chair and fill the three empty commission seats, two republican and one democrat or independent. simons, a partner at the law firm paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton & garrison llp, was a director of the ftc’s bureau of competition from 2001 to 2003. during simons’ tenure at the ftc, the agency sued to stop diageo plc and pernod ricard from buying seagram spirits and wine in 2001 to prevent a duopoly in rum. the ftc also filed a lawsuit in 2003 to stop haagen dazs owner nestle holdings inc from buying dreyer’s grand ice cream inc, which makes also superpremium ice cream. the ftc later settled both cases. noah phillips, who graduated from stanford law school in 2005, is chief counsel for u.s. senator john cornyn, a texas republican. he is also a veteran of the law firms steptoe & johnson llp and cravath, swaine & moore.  to fill the empty democratic seat on the commission, the president tapped rohit chopra, a financial services expert. chopra, an ally of massachusetts senator elizabeth warren, is currently at the consumer federation of america. the ftc works with the justice department to enforce antitrust law and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising. it is an independent agency that is headed by a chairman and four commissioners. no more than three commissioners can come from any one party.

" president elect donald trump’s national security transition has been more chaotic than others in recent memory, with important positions unfilled and many of his people less able, or willing, to engage on substance, u.s. officials said. the uncertainties surrounding trump’s personnel, policies, and rise to power have rattled many of america’s allies, including japan, germany and britain, at a time when china is more assertive, russia more aggressive, terrorism more diffuse, the middle east still unstable and north korea nuclear armed and unpredictable, said u.s. and foreign diplomats. disruption and uncertainty can provide strategic advantages, mark lagon and ross harrison of georgetown university wrote in foreign policy magazine. “but what is seriously in doubt is whether trump’s disruption will be strategic or beneficial to u.s. foreign policy interests. even before getting elected, he acted like a missile without a guidance system.” top trump officials, however, described the transition as having gone smoothly, including on national security. republican trump’s camp announced on thursday it had asked more than 50 of democrat obama’s appointees to stay on.  however, at least three officials, a senior intelligence officer and two diplomats whose names are on a list of “requested political holdovers,” will depart. principal deputy director of national intelligence stephanie o’sullivan, under secretary of state catherine novelli and assistant secretary of state toria nuland appear on a jan. 17 partial list of people the transition wanted to remain after trump’s inauguration on friday. the two diplomats have told colleagues they are going, and o’sullivan is keeping her long standing plans to retire. a u.s. official said that nuland was never asked by the transition to stay on and was unaware of her name appearing on such a list. the state department declined comment. the trump transition and the office of the director of national intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. it is not clearly whether the uncertainties extend to other parts of the government, but another senior official at a national security agency said trump’s effort was “much slower” than the 2001 bill clinton to george w. bush or the 2009 bush to barack obama handovers. “personnel appointments were far more advanced in both those cases,” said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. “in both cases, advance teams were working on substance.” during the 2008 2009 transition, the official said, incoming and outgoing officials had worked together on issues “in a very harmonious fashion.” “none of that is the case in this transition,” he added. he said that he had expected to have met by now with his likely replacement or others on the transition, but had not. “it’s not just me. everybody’s experience is like mine.” speaking to reporters on thursday, vice president elect michael pence said trump’s transition was being completed ahead of schedule and under budget. “our job is to be ready on day one. the american people can be confident that we will be.” trump spokesman sean spicer also told reporters that contact between the incoming and outgoing national security council staffs had been “tremendous.” “we’ve had reams of briefings,” he said. “that is one area where frankly they have been very, very aggressive and robust with both meeting with their counterparts and ensuring that the team is ready to go day one.”trump’s team did not respond to requests for further comment. three state department officials, though, called the transition there “a mess,” and said that until recently the trump team had little contact with department officials and read few if any of their briefing books.     that has left many career officials with misgivings about the incoming administration and the possibility that many foreign policy and national security veterans may be swept out. a dozen serving officials at four intelligence agencies said they are troubled by trump’s apparent disdain for their work; by his designated national security advisor michael flynn’s perceived bent for conspiracy theories and hostility toward some of his former colleagues; and by what some say is the incoming president’s disinterest in the briefings he has received. two officials with knowledge of those briefings said trump’s attention has wandered, he has asked few questions, has read few if any of the briefing books he’s been given – including the one on russian hacking of the 2016 election   and has requested few topical sessions, one of which was on north korea. secretary of state john kerry and his nominated replacement, rex tillerson, were to meet on thursday, but their schedules did not mesh, state department spokesman john kirby told reporters. one obama official, who has dealt with the trump transition team at the state department and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it appeared ‘totally disconnected’ from trump’s top echelon of advisers and from tillerson. tillerson’s nomination is not expected to get a senate foreign relations committee vote before monday at the earliest.

" u.s. short term rental service airbnb inc has removed listings in beijing as the capital prepares to host a five yearly party congress later this month, the most important event on china s political calendar during which security is at its highest. a reuters search on wednesday of airbnb listings in the city s center yielded  zero  results for all of october. listings were present as recently as tuesday evening for periods including the congress dates of oct. 18 to 31.  due to external circumstances, homes in certain areas in beijing are unavailable through october 31,  airbnb said in an email to hosts reviewed by reuters. the move, mirrored by local rental firms, comes a week before the congress where president xi jinping is widely expected to consolidate power in a leadership reshuffle. such high profile events are often accompanied by increased surveillance and online censorship. during the last congress, in 2012, access to alphabet inc s google search engine was cut off. google services have since been blocked in china. for this year s event, authorities have stepped up id checks at metro stations and elsewhere in an effort to detain unregistered workers and others illegally residing in beijing. four airbnb hosts in the capital told reuters they had received notices from the u.s. firm late on tuesday, which said properties in certain areas of the city would be removed from its website until the end of the month due to  external circumstances .  similar to action taken by other hospitality companies, airbnb listings in certain areas in beijing will be temporarily unavailable throughout october,  the company said in a statement to reuters. short term rentals were also unavailable during the same period via local services xiaozhu.com and tujia.com. neither firm responded to requests for comment. airbnb and other home stay sites occupy a legal grey area in china, where tourists are required to register accommodation with local police using a passport or identification card. the requirement is harder to enforce with short term rentals. the ministry of public security and beijing s city police did not respond to faxed requests for comment.

" the leader of germany s social democrats (spd) said on monday he would launch talks with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives on forming a government next week if members of his center left party gave him the green light at a congress this weekend. the remarks by martin schulz raised hopes that the two parties that suffered losses to the far right in an election in september could renew an alliance that has ruled germany since 2013 and end the political deadlock in europe s largest economy. merkel turned to the spd after failing to form a three way alliance with the left leaning greens and the pro business free democrats, plunging germany into a political impasse and raising doubt about her future after 12 years in power.  we ll explore whether and how the formation of a government is possible in germany,  schulz told journalists. the spd party board leadership had earlier set down its key demands for coalition talks with the conservatives. on the divisive issue of immigration, one of the main reasons for the collapse of merkel s first effort, the spd said it opposed a conservative plan to extend a ban on the right to family reunions for some asylum seekers.  family reunions and family cohabitation lead to good integration,  the spd document said.  that s why we are against extending the suspension of family reunions.  in a sign of the tensions likely to bubble up between the parties, horst seehofer, leader of the arch conservative bavarian sister party to merkel s christian democrats (cdu), warned the spd not to try to prevent attempts to extend the ban on family reunifications.  that would lead to such a huge migrant influx again that germany s ability to integrate them all would be completely overstretched,  seehofer, leader of the christian social union (csu), told bild newspaper. merkel could also face complications from her own camp. her arch conservative csu allies in bavaria on monday named right winger markus soeder to be their candidate for the state premiership in a regional election next autumn, potentially weakening her hand as she negotiates with the spd. merkel s cdu and the csu bled support to the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) in september s federal election because of anger at the chancellor s decision in 2015 to open germany s door to more than a million asylum seekers. the csu now fears losing more votes at regional level. the future of seehofer had been in question since the election. after the losses, merkel reluctantly accepted a csu demand to put a limit on the number of asylum seekers germany will accept each year. asked why he was clearing the stage for soeder to lead the csu in next year s vote in bavaria, seehofer said:  the past doesn t win you any elections.  soeder, who has accused merkel of pulling the conservatives to the left and took a hard line on greece during the euro zone crisis, is likely to be a bigger thorn in merkel s side than seehofer, who is expected to remain party leader.  for its part, the spd, which has governed in coalition under merkel since 2013, suffered its worst election result in postwar history in september, and had been reluctant to join another  grand coalition . it dropped its pledge to go into opposition only after merkel failed to form a government, bowing to pressure from president frank walter steinmeier to ease the deadlock. the spd will hold a party congress in berlin this weekend, where it is expected to debate its position on coalition talks. kevin kuehnert, the head of the spd s youth wing   which opposes another grand coalition   told die welt newspaper that the outgoing cdu csu spd government had been characterized by  cheap and often quite bad compromises, such as on urgently needed investment in education and infrastructure . the spd did not stake out a position on the conservatives  upper limit on refugees in its policy document. but it did say germany should work with french president emmanuel macron on strengthening the european project through policies geared to fight high youth unemployment. it did not mention key proposals by macron that the euro zone should have its own budget and finance minister, but it did refer to his plan for closer defense cooperation. on the economy, the spd s proposals for more rights for workers and employee friendly regulation of the large temporary work sector could draw fire from the csu. the long political impasse is starting to worry investors. an investor sentiment survey tracking germany fell in december. the research group sentix said investors wanted to know how expensive a tie up with the spd would be.

" u.s. president donald trump removed his chief strategist steve bannon from the national security council on wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions. trump’s overhaul of the nsc, confirmed by a white house official, also elevated general joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and dan coats, the director of national intelligence who heads all 17 u.s. intelligence agencies. the official said the change moves the nsc “back to its core function of what it’s supposed to do.” it also appears to mark a victory for national security adviser h.r. mcmaster, who had told some national security experts he felt he was in a “battle to the death” with bannon and others on the white house staff. vice president mike pence said bannon would continue to play an important role in policy and played down the shake up as routine. “this is just a natural evolution to ensure the national security council is organized in a way that best serves the president in resolving and making those difficult decisions,” pence said on fox news.  bannon said in a statement he had succeeded in returning the nsc back to its traditional role of coordinating foreign policy rather than running it. he cited president barack obama’s national security adviser, susan rice, for why he advocated a change. “susan rice operationalized the nsc during the last administration so i was put on nsc to ensure it was ‘de operationalized.’ general mcmaster has nsc back to its proper function,” he said. trump’s white house team has grappled with infighting and intrigue that has hobbled his young presidency. in recent days, several other senior u.s. foreign policy and national security officials have said the mechanisms for shaping the trump administration’s response to pressing challenges such as syria, north korea and iran still were not in place.  critics of bannon’s role on the nsc said it gave too much weight in decision making to someone who lacked foreign policy expertise. bannon, who was chief executive of trump’s presidential campaign in the months leading to his election in november, in some respects represents trump’s “america first” nationalistic voice, helping fuel his anti washington fervor and pushing for the president to part ways at times with mainstream republicans. before joining the trump administration, bannon headed breitbart news, a right wing website. u.s. representative adam schiff, ranking democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee, called the shift in the nsc a positive step that will help mcmaster “gain control over a body that was being politicized by bannon’s involvement.” “as the administration’s policy over north korea, china, russia and syria continues to drift, we can only hope this shake up brings some level of strategic vision to the body,” he said. bannon’s removal from the nsc was a potential setback for his sphere of influence in the trump white house, where he has a voice in most major decisions. but a trump confidant said bannon remained as influential as ever. “he is still involved in everything and still has the full confidence of the president but to be fair he can only do so much stuff,” the confidant said, speaking on condition of anonymity. the white house official said bannon was no longer needed on the nsc after the departure of trump’s first national security adviser, michael flynn. flynn was forced to resign on feb. 13 over his contacts with russia’s ambassador to the united states, sergei kislyak, prior to trump taking office on jan. 20. the official said bannon had been placed on the nsc originally as a check on flynn and had only attended one of the nsc’s regular meetings. the official dismissed questions about a power struggle between bannon and mcmaster, saying they shared the same world view. however, two current national security officials rejected the white house explanation, noting that two months have passed since flynn’s departure. mcmaster, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also has dueled with bannon and others over direct access to trump; the future of deputy national security adviser k.t. mcfarland, a former fox news commentator; intelligence director ezra cohen watnick, a flynn appointee; and other staffing decisions. trump is preparing for his first face to face meeting on thursday and friday with chinese president xi jinping with the threat of north korea’s nuclear and missile programs a key component of their talks. bannon’s seat on the nsc’s “principals’ committee,” a group that includes the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides, was taken by rick perry, who as energy secretary is charged with overseeing the u.s. nuclear weapons arsenal.

" britain has only 10 days left to deliver on all three areas of its divorce terms with the european union if london wants to start talks on a transition period after brexit and a future relationship, the chairman of eu leaders donald tusk said.  we need to see progress from uk within 10 days on all issues, including on ireland,  tusk tweeted on friday after a meeting with british prime minister theresa may in brussels.  sufficient progress in brexit talks at december council is possible but still a huge challenge,  he said on twitter. an eu official said that may agreed in the one hour discussions that dec. 4 was the  absolute deadline  to allow the eu s brexit negotiator michel barnier to recommend moving onto the next stage on trade and future ties.  tusk presented the timeline ahead of the december european council, with dec. 4 as the absolute deadline for the uk to make additional efforts, allowing barnier to be in a position to recommend sufficient progress,  the official said.   may agreed to this timeframe,  the official said. the official said tusk had warned that if there was no progress within next 10 days, that would make moving forward impossible. the official said that the way ireland s border with northern ireland functioned after britain leaves the eu in march 2019 was still an issue.   the uk will need to give credible assurances as to how to avoid a hard border before dec. 4, as it is still unclear how this can be done,  the official said.

" the u.s. air force contract to start replacing the aging fleet of jstars spy and battle management planes is expected to be awarded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, air force secretary deborah james said on wednesday. james told a u.s. house of representatives armed services committee hearing it was regrettable it was taking longer than expected to award the engineering, manufacturing and development contract. last year the pentagon’s chief arms buyer approved the next step in a multibillion dollar competition to replace 16 joint surveillance target attack radar system aircraft, or jstars, which have flown over 100,000 combat hours and are approaching the end of their service life.

" donald trump’s nominee to head the cia sought on thursday to repair damage from the president elect’s feud with u.s. intelligence agencies, saying he accepted their findings on russian hacking, would not comply if ordered to renew use of harsh interrogation techniques and would always “have their backs.” mike pompeo’s testimony at his senate confirmation hearing appeared aimed at reassuring staff at the agency he has been picked to lead, even at the risk of contradicting or distancing himself from some of trump’s strongest criticism of the intelligence community. diverging from trump’s stated aim of seeking closer ties with russia, pompeo accused the russian leadership of “aggressive action” in meddling in the november u.s. elections, of “asserting itself aggressively” by occupying part of ukraine and of doing “doing nearly nothing” to destroy islamic state. pompeo, a republican member of the house of representatives and a former u.s. army officer, insisted that if necessary he would be ready to stand up to trump, who takes office on jan. 20, and would shield cia operatives against any effort to politicize its work. “you have my commitment that every day, i will not only speak truth to power, but i will demand that the men and the women (of the cia) ... follow my instruction to do that each and every day,” he said. for weeks, the republican president elect questioned the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that russia used hacking and other tactics to try to tilt the election in his favor   an unprecedented breach between an incoming u.s. leader and the intelligence operatives he will soon command. trump said on wednesday that russia was behind the hacking but that other countries were hacking the united states as well. asked about the hacking, pompeo said he was very clear about what he called an “aggressive action” ordered by the russian leadership, and accepted the u.s. intelligence report on the matter. “i’ve seen nothing to cast any doubt on the findings in the report,” he said. trump this week also furiously denounced intelligence officials for what he said were leaks to the media by intelligence agencies of a dossier that makes unverified, salacious allegations about his contacts in russia. by contrast, pompeo voiced strong support for the agency,  saying he has seen central intelligence agency staff “walk through fire.” he said he understood it would be a problem “if folks were afraid there would be political retribution” and promised “to have their backs at every single moment. you have my word i will do that.” pompeo also signaled he would stand firm if necessary against trump on the issue of enhanced interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects. such techniques, which were introduced under president george w. bush after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the united states, are widely regarded as torture and their use has been banned by congress. trump said during the election campaign the united states should bring back tactics such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, although since the election he has said he has heard arguments against such methods. asked about the issue, pompeo said that he would “absolutely not” restart enhanced interrogation techniques by the cia if asked by the president elect. he noted it would take a change in the law for the cia to use interrogation techniques that go beyond those permitted by the army, adding he could not imagine that trump would order the cia to use illegal methods. pompeo, a conservative lawmaker from kansas who is on the house intelligence committee, emphasized that he would be a neutral assessor of challenges and threats. in opening remarks he said he understood that if confirmed his role would switch from policymaker to provider of information. noting that the cia does not make policy on any country, he added, “it is a policy decision as to what to do with russia, but it will be essential that the agency provide policymakers with accurate intelligence and clear eyed analysis of russian activities.” equally, he said that he would drop the opposition he has had as a lawmaker to the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and major powers. he said the cia must be “rigorously fair and objective” in assessing the deal. but he called the iranians “professionals at cheating” and said he would work to improve u.s. capability to detect violations of tehran’s commitment to curb its nuclear activities. he called iran an “emboldened, disruptive player in the middle east, fuelling tensions” with sunni muslim allies of the united states.  pompeo listed it among the challenges facing the united states along with what he called a “resilient” islamic state and the fallout from syria’s long civil war. pompeo also named north korea, which he said had “dangerously accelerated its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.” he said china was creating “real tensions” with its activities in the south china sea and in cyberspace as it flexed its muscles and expanded its military and economic reach.

" u.s. lawmakers are expected to pass a large aid package for victims of hurricane harvey, but specifics of the plan and its price tag are unclear as congress awaits a funding request from the trump administration. rain continued to pound houston and the gulf coast on monday as president donald trump said he expected rapid federal action to help fund a costly recovery. he plans to visit texas on tuesday to see storm hit areas. “we’re dealing with congress. as you know it’s going to be a very expensive situation,” he told reporters in the white house. historic flooding from harvey, which came ashore in texas last week as a powerful category 4 hurricane and is now a tropical storm, has killed at least seven people in texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes. wall street analysts estimated insured losses of up to $20 billion, making harvey one of the costliest storms in history for u.s. insurers. after past disasters, congress approved billions of dollars in funds to help with relief and recovery, but in recent years, fiscal conservatives have raised questions about costs. congress will return next week from summer vacation, with the hurricane complicating an already difficult fiscal situation with the federal budget and trump’s mexican border wall proposal. current government funding runs out on sept. 30. congress must approve a measure to keep the government funded and prevent a shutdown. trump threatened last week to shut down the government if congress did not agree to $1.6 billion in funding to start building his proposed wall on the u.s. mexico border. harvey “will increase the pressure on washington to not shut down the government, but it also makes the september 30 package more cumbersome and complicated,” chris krueger, policy analyst at financial firm cowen & co, said in a research note. asked if harvey made him reconsider his shutdown threat, trump said: “it has nothing to do with it, really. i think this is separate. this is going to go really very, very quickly.” congressional republicans have not spelled out their plan for dealing with the budget and a related, must pass increase in the federal debt ceiling. some aides and analysts have speculated that those issues might be swept into a single piece of legislation, possibly including harvey aid.  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on monday that “republicans must be ready to join democrats in passing a timely relief bill.” federal emergency management agency administrator brock long said more than 450,000 people were expected to seek disaster assistance because of catastrophic flooding. “we will help those affected by this terrible disaster. the first step in that process is a formal request for resources from the administration,” said ashlee strong, spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan. a senate republican aide said it was too soon to say what was needed. “the committee is monitoring the situation in texas closely,” said chris gallegos, a spokesman for the republican majority on the senate appropriations committee. there is only about $3.3 billion in the federal disaster relief fund. congress approved $62.3 billion in aid after hurricane katrina devastated gulf coast communities and flooded new orleans in 2005. texas republican representative pete sessions told msnbc he expected lawmakers to back any aid package as long as it was not bloated beyond the needed storm response. some conservatives have balked in the past at authorizing money for disaster relief. in 2005, then indiana republican representative mike pence, now vice president, called on the floor of the house for “offsetting” money spent on katrina relief with cutbacks elsewhere. almost the entire texas delegation   including sessions and republican senator ted cruz   opposed the $50.5 billion aid package that congress approved three months after hurricane sandy hit new jersey and new york in 2012. opponents argued that the sandy package funded things unrelated to the disaster.       “the sandy relief bill had more pork in it than a bacon factory,” said representative blake farenthold, a republican who represents corpus christi, which was hit hard by harvey. republican representative pete king of new york said in a twitter message on monday: “i won’t abandon texas the way ted cruz did new york.” ",0
" president donald trump said on tuesday that a tax reform plan being discussed with lawmakers will cut taxes “tremendously” for the middle class, nearly double the standard deduction and try to make the tax code simple and fair. trump, who was meeting with members of the house ways and means committee, told reporters: “i look forward to working with the members of congress gathered here today to pass the reform and the massive tax cuts that our country desperately needs to thrive, to grow, to prosper.” he added that his administration was “very disappointed” in a couple of republican senators who failed to support a republican bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act.

" informal mining in brazil is seen by many as a scourge polluting the amazon rainforest, poisoning indigenous tribes and robbing the nation of its wealth.  for others it is a way of life. brazilian garimpos, or wildcat mines, are operated by small crews of men, often caked in red brown mud and working with rudimentary pans, shovels and sluice boxes that have been used for centuries. more sophisticated operations use water cannons and boats sucking mud from the bottoms of rivers. regardless of the method, searching for gold and other minerals like cassiterite and niobium is dirty, dangerous and often illegal.  looking for gold is like playing in a casino,  said a 48 year old miner. miners asked not to be named, saying they feared the police  as much of their work is illegal. he started in the wildcat mines as a teenager in the area around crepurizao   a ramshackle frontier town of 5,000 with a dirt landing strip that is a gateway for informal mining in the region. garimpos are in the spotlight as brazil debates opening an area known as renca in the northern amazon forest to mining, which has met with stiff resistance from environmentalists. mines and energy minister fernando coelho filho argues that licensed mining will be an improvement over the estimated 1,000 people currently mining in the reserve illegally. crepurizao lies hundreds of miles south of renca, but gives a window into life in the garimpos caught up in the debate. living in makeshift homes of wood and plastic, miners in the area ship some 60 kilograms (132 lbs) of gold per month, according to traders. that much pure gold is worth millions of dollars on the global market, but high costs and layers of traders in the local market leave most miners living on the brink of poverty. basic staples can cost four or five times the price in the nearest city, an eight hour bus ride away.  fuel stations, a general store, a bar, an evangelical church and prostitutes vie for the income and attention of the miners, known as garimpeiros, when they aren t working or lazing in hammocks. there are 2,113 licensed garimpo sites in brazil, according to ministry data, but environmental experts and two government officials, who asked not to be named, said far more small scale mines skip the licensing and ignore regulations altogether. in crepurizao, where mines often cluster close together, it was unclear which operations were licensed. the total area worked by garimpeiros in brazil is thought to be small. but chemicals like mercury, which miners in crepurizao dump to separate gold from grit, can leave a large footprint of contamination. in march last year, a government backed study of indigenous villages in the northern state of roraima revealed alarming levels of mercury. one group of villagers had more than double the level of mercury considered to be a serious health risk   such as damage to the central nervous system, kidneys, heart and reproductive process   detected in their hair. the mining and energy ministry said a new oversight agency created in a decree by president michel temer, now pending congressional approval, would allow more effective government coordination and inspections to restrict illegal mining. congressman leonardo quintao, who sits on the committee considering the new agency, said it will be able to raise more funding for oversight. he said the regulations target licensed miners, while illegal mining remains a matter for the police. still, one ibama enforcement officer, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said the government had left miners like those in crepurizao in a precarious limbo.  you can t just pull them out of the garimpos and the cities that are living off gold. and the government does not offer them structure and decent conditions,  said the officer.  so they re stranded there without the minimum conditions for survival.

" a public inquiry into a fire that killed at least 80 people at london s grenfell tower will get to the truth about the tragedy, its chairman pledged on thursday, but critics said survivors of the blaze were still being failed. the 24 storey social housing block, home to a poor, multi ethnic community, was gutted on june 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building. grenfell tower was part of a deprived housing estate in kensington and chelsea, one of the richest boroughs in london, and the disaster has prompted a national debate about social inequality and government neglect of poor communities. the inquiry started with a minute s silence to honor the victims, whose exact number remains unknown because of the devastation inside the tower.  (the inquiry) can and will provide answers to the pressing questions of how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st century london,  its chairman, retired judge martin moore bick, said in his opening statement. he said the inquiry was not there to punish anyone or to award compensation, but to get to the truth. a separate police investigation is underway, which could result in manslaughter charges. there have been no arrests. the inquiry will examine the cause and spread of the fire, the design, construction and refurbishment of the tower, whether fire regulations relating to high rise buildings are adequate and whether they were complied with. it will also look at the actions of the authorities before and after the tragedy. but critics warned of a disconnect between the technical, legalistic inquiry process and the ongoing ordeal of traumatized former grenfell tower residents still awaiting new homes. prime minister theresa may pledged that all families whose homes were destroyed in the fire would be rehoused within three weeks, but three months later most still live in hotels. just three out of 197 households that needed rehousing have moved into permanent homes, while 29 have moved into temporary accommodation.  we lost everything. it s difficult for the other people to be in our shoes,  miguel alves, who escaped his 13th floor apartment in grenfell tower with his family, told the bbc.  now i m without anything, i m in the hotel, i have to cope with my family. my daughter, she just started school. they need some stability and that i cannot give to my family,  he said. emma dent coad, a member of parliament from the opposition labour party who represents the area, said the inquiry s remit was too narrow and would fail to address the blaze s deeper causes such as failings in social housing policies. she also criticized the choice of venue for moore bick s opening statement, a lavishly decorated room in central london.  we were sitting in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers. i think it was the most incredibly inappropriate place to have something like that, and actually says it all about the us and them divide that people see,  she told the bbc. many of those affected have also expressed disquiet about the fact that moore bick and the other lawyers appointed to run the inquiry are all white and part of a perceived  establishment  far removed from their own circumstances.  the experience of many residents of that tower is that they were ignored because of their immigration status,  lawyer jolyon maugham, who is advising some residents, told the bbc.  we need someone on the inquiry team that can speak to that experience and at the moment on the panel we have a bunch of white privileged barristers,  he said. one of the difficulties facing the inquiry is that it needs former residents to give evidence but some fear possible deportation. the government has said it would grant a 12 month amnesty to anyone affected by the fire who was in britain illegally. supporters say only permanent residency rights will persuade people to come forward.

" saudi air defenses shot down a ballistic missile fired by yemen s houthi group towards riyadh on tuesday, the saudi led coalition said, in an attack that could escalate a proxy war between the kingdom and iran. there were no reports of casualties or damage. in contrast, a u.n. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 non combatants in war torn yemen since dec. 6. the iran aligned houthi movement said it had aimed the missile at the saudi royal court at al yamama palace, where a meeting of saudi leaders was under way. it described the attack as a new chapter in the conflict.  the saudi led coalition said the missile, the latest of several fired towards riyadh, had been directed at residential areas and there had been no damage.  quoting a statement from the coalition, saudi state news agency spa said iranian made missiles were a threat to regional and international security. it accused the houthis of using humanitarian entry points into yemen to smuggle in missiles from saudi arabia s regional arch foe iran.  coalition forces confirm intercepting an iranian houthi missile targeting (the) south of riyadh. there are no reported casualties at this time,  the government run center for international communication wrote on its twitter account. saudi palaces, military and oil facilities are within range of such missiles, the houthis said in a statement carried by the group s al masirah television. the u.s. state department condemned the missile attack and called on iran to stop arming the houthis. at the united nations, u.s. ambassador nikki haley said the houthi missile strike  bears all the hallmarks of previous attacks using iranian provided weapons.  haley said she was exploring, with some u.n. security council colleagues, several options for pressuring iran to  adjust their behavior.  haley is likely to struggle, however, to convince some members, like veto powers russia and china, that u.n. action is needed. saudi arabia and iran are locked in struggle for influence in the middle east. the conflict in saudi arabia s backyard yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced over 2 million.     the houthis for their part have fired several missiles at the kingdom, but have not caused any serious damage. the attack came as the houthis marked 1,000 days since the saudi led coalition began military operations in yemen in march 2015 after the iran aligned group drove yemeni president abd rabbu mansour hadi into exile.  the enemies had their own mirage calculations ... but over 1,000 days, there has been this great steadfastness,  said abdel malek al houthi, a houthi leader, in a speech on the group s al masirah tv. the united arab emirates, a close ally of saudi arabia and part of its coalition, said the latest houthi attack underscored the need to keep the military campaign in yemen going.  with every iranian missile fired by the houthi militia against civilian targets, the necessity of (operation) decisive storm becomes clear,  united arab emirates minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash wrote on his twitter account. lebanese prime minister saad al hariri condemned the attack, saying such actions exacerbated divisions in the region. saudi arabia and iran are also competing for influence in iraq and syria. reuters witnesses described hearing a blast and said they saw smoke in the northeast of riyadh. saudi arabia s crown prince, mohammed bin salman, has described what riyadh says is iran s supply of rockets to the houthis as  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war. iran has denied supplying such weaponry to the houthis, who have taken over the yemeni capital, sanaa, and other parts of the country during its civil war. saudi arabia said on nov. 4 it had intercepted a ballistic missile over riyadh s king khaled airport, an attack that led the coalition to close yemeni ports.  on nov. 30, saudi arabia shot down another missile near its southwestern city of khamis mushait. last week, the united states presented for the first time pieces of what it said were iranian weapons supplied to the  houthis, describing them as conclusive evidence that tehran was violating u.n. resolutions. the arms included charred remnants of what the pentagon said was an iranian made short range ballistic missile fired from yemen in the nov. 4 attack, as well as a drone and an anti tank weapon recovered in yemen by the saudis.

" for years the national political organizations of both democratic and republican state attorneys general observed an agreement not to target the other party’s incumbent office holders in elections.  that hands off stance ended this month when republican ags voted to abandon the agreement and spend money to help unseat democrats in other states, according to the republican attorneys general association. the decision has not been previously reported.  the move comes as democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of republican president donald trump’s policies. state ags in washington and hawaii successfully sued to block trump’s executive orders restricting travel from some muslim majority countries, and california’s attorney general has pledged to defend the state’s environmental standards.  republican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that ags should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents, two sources familiar with the closed door process said. additionally, a desire by some to roll back same sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations.  the  so called ‘incumbency rule’ observed by the state attorneys’ party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of u.s. politics, aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest, such as consumer protection.  attorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state, charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own. ags took tobacco companies to court in the 1990s, and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. in larger states, an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources.  twelve republican state ags on monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting trump’s revised travel restrictions.  scott will, executive director of the republican attorneys general association, confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule, but declined to discuss specifics of the vote.  “the stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table,” will said in a statement to reuters.  the vote was taken over the phone with a tally of 15 8, the two sources said. not every republican ag participated.  some of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents, so ags shouldn’t be any different, the sources said.  those opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship, and noted that republican ags had grown their ranks under the current system, showing there was no need to change the rules now, the sources said.  in 2000, republicans held 12 of the 51 state ag positions, including the district of columbia, but that number is about to hit 29, if a nomination made by new hampshire’s republican governor this month is confirmed.  one of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in virginia, where attorney general mark herring, a democrat, is seeking reelection this november. in all, 31 ag elections are scheduled for 2018. republicans currently hold 18 of those seats, compared to 13 for democrats, but some of the incumbents may not run for re election.  karl racine, attorney general for the district of columbia and current co chair of the democratic attorneys general association, said the republican group’s decision likely means democrats will follow suit.  “what’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” racine said in an interview.  colorado attorney general cynthia coffman, a republican, is up for election next year in a state that has been trending democrat. a well funded push to unseat her, something the democratic ag group wouldn’t have participated in under the incumbency agreement, could spell trouble.  coffman opposed the incumbency rule change, the sources said. her office did not respond to a request for comment.  in laying out the reasons for the rule change, will pointed to the key role republican ags played in opposing some of president barack obama’s policies.  rolling back same sex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations, said the two people familiar with the discussion. more republican state ags could help further that effort, though the current composition of the u.s. supreme court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely.  additionally, the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating democratic ags, the two sources said.  participants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage 5 hour energy, the sources said. the money depended on the republican group changing its rules to target incumbent democrats.  the company that manufactures 5 hour energy, innovation ventures, declined to comment. a spokesman for the republican ag group declined to answer questions about the debate, including the role of 5 hour’s pledge.  innovation ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink, with varied outcomes.  last month a washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly $4.3 million in one such case, brought by bob ferguson, the democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block trump’s first travel restrictions. the company has said it would appeal the ruling. in at least two other cases, in oregon and indiana, innovation ventures prevailed. oregon has appealed.  the precise dollar amount of the company’s pledge to republican ags could not be determined, nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target democrats.  already, the republican attorneys general association has built a fundraising advantage. in 2016, it raised about $14.5 million, including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the judicial crisis network and koch industries, according to tax filings.  sean rankin, executive director of the democratic ag group, said it raised about $5.2 million in 2016. the group’s tax filings show a mix of contributors including companies, plaintiff law firms and labor unions.

" u.s. republicans on tuesday fell short yet again in their seven year drive to repeal obamacare, in a bitter defeat that raises more questions about their ability to enact president donald trump’s agenda. the party was unable to win enough support from its own senators for a bill to repeal the 2010 affordable care act and decided not to put it to a vote, several republicans said. the bill’s sponsors vowed to try again, but face steeper odds after sunday, when special rules expire that allow them to pass healthcare legislation without democratic support. “we basically ran out of time,” said senator ron johnson, a co sponsor of the measure with senators bill cassidy, lindsey graham and dean heller. republicans have now repeatedly failed to deliver on their longtime promise to roll back former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic accomplishment.     they have yet to achieve any major domestic policy successes in congress this year, which could hurt their efforts to retain control of the senate and house of representatives in the november 2018 congressional elections. republicans widely view obamacare, which provides coverage to 20 million americans, as a costly government overreach. trump vowed frequently during the 2016 election campaign to scrap it. democrats have fiercely defended it, saying it has extended health insurance to millions.  after falling short in july, senate republicans tried again this month with a bill that would have given states greater control over the hundreds of billions of dollars that the federal government spends annually on health care. as before, they ran into objections from members on the right and the center who opposed repeal for essentially opposite reasons. senator susan collins, a moderate, complained it undermined the medicaid program for the poor and weakened consumer protections. senator rand paul, a conservative, said it left too many of obamacare’s regulations and spending programs in place. democrats said it was time for republicans to work with them to fix obamacare’s shortcomings, and republican senator lamar alexander said he would resume talks with democratic senator patty murray to shore up the law’s insurance subsidies. shares of healthcare providers ended broadly higher. hospital company hca healthcare inc rose 1.8 percent, while insurer centene corp, which focuses on medicaid, rose 2.2 percent. the insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the american medical association, american heart association and american cancer society, the aarp advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists opposed the latest bill. trump said on tuesday his administration was disappointed in “certain so called republicans” who did not support the bill. the republican president said later he still had not given up hope that the law would eventually be repealed. “it’ll happen,” he told reporters while traveling to new york for a fundraiser. republicans hold a slim 52 48 majority in the senate and  at least three senators   collins, paul and john mccain of arizona   had publicly rejected the bill. republicans crafted special rules earlier this year that allowed them to pass a bill with a simple majority in the 100 seat chamber. after those rules expire at the start of the new fiscal year on sunday, they will need at least 60 votes to advance most legislation.  john thune, a member of the republican leadership in the senate, said the party would likely not try to undo obamacare again until it was clear there were enough votes for it. he said the party would now focus on overhauling the u.s. tax code   another complex undertaking that could meet with stiff resistance from a wide range of interest groups. a cbs poll on monday showed 52 percent of americans disapproved of the graham cassidy healthcare bill, while 20 percent approved.       “i will readily admit that the republican party has done a bad job of explaining what we’re for in terms of replace on obamacare,” republican senator ben sasse said on the senate floor. six protesters staged a “die in” on the floor of a senate  office building, lying on the ground and covering their heads and bodies with a white shroud to represent what they said would be lives lost if the bill passed. the non partisan congressional budget office said the number of people with health insurance covering high cost medical events would be slashed by millions if the latest republican bill had it become law.  the cbo also found that federal spending on medicaid would be cut by about $1 trillion from 2017 to 2026 and that millions of people would lose their coverage in the program, mainly from a repeal of federal funding for obamacare’s medicaid expansion.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the trump administration’s timetable for tax reform is set to falter following setbacks in negotiations with congress over healthcare, the financial times reported on monday. mnuchin told the financial times in an interview that the target to get tax reforms through congress and on president donald trump’s desk before august was “highly aggressive to not realistic at this point”. ""it is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the healthcare,"" mnuchin told the newspaper. (on.ft.com/2opjltx) mnuchin also told the financial times he agreed with trump’s view that the dollar’s strength in the short term was hurting exports, but said he saw the currency’s strength over the long term as a positive. “as the world’s currency, the primary reserve currency, i think that over long periods of time the strength of the dollar is a good thing,” the financial times quoted mnuchin as saying. trump has signaled he wants to streamline the income tax system, cut federal regulations, reduce corporate income tax and add new taxes to prod companies to keep or move production to the united states. trump and republicans in congress are also trying to overhaul the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare. but efforts to pass a bill in the u.s. house of representatives to repeal and replace obamacare failed last month, dealing a major setback to the administration.

" the white house said on wednesday that it was confident it could meet its obligations under the paris climate change agreement, despite a court ruling temporarily blocking the administration’s limits on power plants’ carbon emissions. the u.s. supreme court dealt a serious blow to the obama administration’s climate change agenda on tuesday when it took the unusual step to delay implementation of the clean power plan until legal challenges to the regulation are completed. the clean power plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from u.s. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels.  while the plan was expected to be the main tool for the united states to meet climate goals agreed to in an international deal in december, white house spokesman eric schultz told reporters in a briefing that it was only one part of the nation’s response to climate change. the long term extension of the tax credits for renewable energy last year will continue to provide momentum that will transition the power sector toward cleaner sources of energy, schultz said. “the inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the clean power plan,” he said. schultz said the administration was in talks with its partners in the deal and that diplomats in those countries understood the complexities of establishing policies in the united states.  he also said he expected that litigation involving the clean power plan to be wrapped up in time for the united states to comply with the climate agreement.

" panama recalled its ambassador to the eu from brussels for consultations after the central american country was included on a european union blacklist of countries deemed as tax havens, the government said on wednesday.   european union finance ministers adopted a blacklist of 17 jurisdictions deemed tax havens on tuesday, in an unprecedented step to counter worldwide tax avoidance, although they did not agree on financial levies for the listed countries.  given the unfortunate incorporation of the country in this discriminatory list, the republic of panama has decided to call its ambassador to the european union, dario chiru, to assess the steps to be followed moving forward,  the government said in a statement.  the list also included american samoa, bahrain, barbados, grenada, guam, south korea, macau, marshall islands, mongolia, namibia, palau, saint lucia, samoa, trinidad and tobago, tunisia and united arab emirates (uae). the government of the caribbean islands of trinidad and tobago said on wednesday that it soon would take two bills to parliament to reform its tax codes. passage of those bills could help it get removed from the eu blacklist, the government said.   the government of trinidad and tobago shares the goals of the eu with respect to fighting tax abuse and reassures that we will act with alacrity on this matter,  the country s attorney general said in a statement ",0
" senior u.s. house of representatives republican tom cole said on wednesday more funds will be needed to fight the zika virus in the united states, signaling a shift from insistence by many republicans that the obama administration should use existing funds for the effort to combat the growing threat. the zika outbreak began last year in brazil and has spread rapidly through the americas. u.s. officials say local outbreaks are possible in the united states, particularly in southern states like florida and texas where the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active. democrats and obama administration officials have been urging the republican controlled congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight the virus. in a temporary fix, the white house said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for zika’s arrival in the continental united states. representative cole, who chairs the health appropriations subcommittee, said the funds should last until the end of the government’s fiscal year on sept. 30. “there’s going to need to be additional money, i don’t think there’s any doubt about that,” cole told reporters after a house republican meeting. “we’re having discussions about that now.” republican senator marco rubio, who is from florida, broke with other congressional republicans on zika last week, announcing his support for president barack obama’s $1.9 billion request to fight the virus. on wednesday, rubio wrote to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) to urge it to clear a backlog of zika diagnostic tests and prioritize testing for pregnant women, saying he had seen media reports that some pregnant women have waited up to a month for cdc to complete their tests. the white house on wednesday said a bill that passed on tuesday was a positive first step in combating zika but lamented its lack of additional funds needed to fight the virus, which has been linked to a rare birth defect in babies called microcephaly and neurological disorders in adults. white house spokesman josh earnest said he anticipated that president barack obama would sign the bill, which provides financial incentives to companies developing treatments for zika. cole said lawmakers have not decided whether any new money to fight zika would be provided in an appropriations bill, or attached to a “continuing resolution” keeping the government open at current spending levels, if lawmakers end up passing such a measure later this year. “i think the problem is real, certainly there will need to be additional money at the nih on this,” cole said, referring to the national institutes of health. house speaker paul ryan said, however, that if more money is needed to fight zika, lawmakers will address the matter through the regular appropriations process. “we will address the situation through the regular appropriations process as the need arises, and our appropriators are looking at how to do just that,” ryan said at a press conference.

" russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on thursday that russia was preparing lawsuits to reclaim what moscow says was illegally seized property in the united states, russia s foreign ministry said. lavrov, in a telephone conversation with tillerson, also said it was unacceptable that u.s. authorities had removed russian flags from its seized diplomatic buildings in the united states, the ministry said. u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert, asked about the accusations later, told reporters that u.s. actions at the shuttered russian facilities were  perfectly legal  and were carried out with  a lot of thought  and in a  judicious fashion.   the flags of the former russian consular properties in san francisco were respectfully lowered. they re safely stored within each of the buildings,  nauert said.  there s no country in the world that pays greater respect to its own flag and to the flags of other nations. that is something that we take seriously.  but russia s foreign ministry said lavrov stressed to tillerson that  the lawlessness continued by u.s. officials runs counter to declarations made at the highest level in washington about intentions to normalize the bilateral relations, which have hit an all time low.  russian staff left the consulate in san francisco last month after washington ordered moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties, part of a series of tit for tat actions resulting from a souring of relations between the two countries.

" president michel aoun held talks on monday with other lebanese political leaders over the future of prime minister saad al hariri s government, but gave no sign whether they discussed hariri s demand the country steer clear of regional turmoil. aoun s office said the talks were positive and constructive but did not detail steps to address the demands hariri made after postponing his shock resignation, notably that lebanese stick by the state policy of staying out of regional conflicts   a reference to iran backed shi ite group hezbollah. the consultations would continue once aoun returns on friday from an official visit to italy, the statement said.     a senior lebanese official said the consultations at the presidential palace in baabda aimed to help hariri s government  get back on its feet , after weeks of political instability triggered by hariri s nov. 4 resignation, announced in riyadh. lebanese officials say saudi arabia forced hariri to resign and held him against his will, triggering an intervention by france which led to his return to beirut last week. riyadh says hariri, lebanon s top sunni muslim politician and a long time saudi ally, resigned freely and denies holding him.  in his resignation speech, hariri strongly criticized iran and its heavily armed lebanese shi ite muslim ally hezbollah for meddling in the arab world. since returning to beirut, hariri has said all lebanese must stick by the state policy of  disassociation , or keeping out of regional conflicts   a reference to hezbollah. leading druze politician walid jumblatt, an influential figure in lebanon, said after meeting aoun that it was important to talk about  disassociation , and how to achieve it. he said it would be wise not to bring up the question of hezbollah s weapons in discussions, referring to previous rounds of futile talks on this point. the senior lebanese official said the  consultations might end with lebanon reaffirming the ministerial statement that implicitly includes disassociation . the official spoke on condition of anonymity as aoun s consultations were not over. hariri said on saturday he would not accept  hezbollah stances that affect our arab brothers or target the security and stability of their countries .

" a group of german women s organizations wrote to chancellor angela merkel on monday demanding more support for their goals of equal participation, equal pay and better monitoring of gender policies after the sept. 24 election. merkel was elected as germany s first female chancellor in 2005, helped by strong support from women voters, but the leader of the conservative christian democrats (cdu) has not made fighting for equal rights a major priority.   women in germany have moderated their demands for long enough and repeatedly accepted compromises. without notable progress,  wrote the 17 groups representing 12.5 million women in professions ranging from medicine to law and engineering.  now, new, binding milestones with clear targets need to be defined and achieved.  opinion polls show that merkel should easily win a fourth term, with women still more likely to vote for the cdu than the spd, and far more likely to support merkel   on 60 percent   than her spd challenger martin schulz   on just 20 percent. merkel was initially opposed to quotas, but her government  has introduced a requirement for women to hold 30 percent of seats on non executive company boards after it was championed by her junior coalition partners, the center left social democrats. beyond that, however, progress at boosting female representation in both business and politics has been slow. none of germany s top 30 listed companies has a female ceo and women hold only 7 percent of executive positions in the 160 biggest listed firms, up from 6 percent in 2016. meanwhile, the percentage of women in the german parliament is expected to fall to 32 percent from a current 36.5 percent after the election due to the likely entry of the male dominated free democrats and alternative fuer deutschland (afd). merkel says she wants half her new cabinet to be female, compared to seven out of 16 posts now, although that will depend on which party she shares power with. she has also warned firms they face tougher regulation if they do not promote more women. the women s groups said they welcomed merkel s desire for an equal cabinet and for more women in business, but said more was needed to improve participation and equal pay.  the example of the mandatory gender quota for supervisory boards of large companies shows that legal targets are needed to speed up the necessary processes of change and a switch in role models in business and society,  the letter to merkel said.

" the conviction of former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic for genocide and crimes against humanity serves as a warning to others such as syrian president bashar al assad, the united nations  human rights chief said on wednesday. earlier on wednesday the u.n. criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) found mladic guilty of the slaughter of 8,000 muslim men and boys at srebrenica and for the siege of the bosnian capital sarajevo, in which more than 10,000 civilians were killed by shelling and snipers over 43 months. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein, who worked for the united nations in the former yugoslavia in the 1990s, told reuters he had waited a long time for the life sentence handed down against mladic.  mladic is the epitome of evil and the prosecution of mladic is the epitome of international justice,  zeid said in an interview in his geneva office. noting that mladic is now 74 but was in his 50s at the time of his crimes, zeid said the case showed justice would catch up with other leaders who trampled over human rights.  the passage of time is no protection. eventually i hope all those who have authored these appalling atrocities across the world will be held accountable before a court of law and there will be justice for the victims of those particular crimes.  pressed on whether that would include assad, he said:  yes. it s very clear to us that what happened in syria recently and not limited to syria, in many parts of the world, were so grotesque that if a court of law on the basis of evidence were to prosecute senior leaders then you would expect that some of them would be held responsible.  assad and his government deny committing rights abuses and say they are engaged in a legitimate struggle against terrorist groups including islamic state. trials are led by evidence, zeid said.  and so whatever trials are mounted in the future, if the evidence leads to the very senior rungs of leadership, then you would indeed hope this takes place.   in the end there is justice,  he added. u.n. war crimes investigators documenting massacres and other atrocities in syria have accused all sides of grave crimes including the government s use of chemical weapons against civilians more than two dozen times, as well as executions, torture and rapes. paulo pinheiro, chairman of the u.n. commission of inquiry on syria, said last year that the scale of deaths in prisons indicated that the assad government was responsible for  extermination as a crime against humanity . syria s civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.

" the philippines plans a cut of 75 percent in spending next year on drug rehabilitation facilities, while at the same time seeking a massive hike in funding for a war on drugs that has killed thousands, fuelling concerns among lawmakers.  the government has rejected criticism that it lacked the commitment to rehabilitate drug users, saying it has attracted financing and is building treatment facilities, but had underestimated the scale of addiction.   more than 3,800 people, most of them drugs suspects, have died in police operations in the drug war unleashed by president rodrigo duterte in july last year. police deny they were executing suspects, saying those killed had violently resisted arrest. senator ralph recto, who has questioned the government s anti drugs budget, said he would scrutinize its proposal to cut expenditure on drug rehabilitation centers by 2.3 billion pesos ($45.23 million), compared to this year. the government has asked congress for an increase of more than 40 times in next year s police budget for anti drugs operations next year.  i will discuss these issues when the budget is formally presented,  recto told reuters in a text message. the lack of rehabilitation centers would cripple the  declared government policy  to wean substance abusers off drugs, recto said in a statement over the weekend.     in august, health secretary paulyn ubial said eight drug rehabilitation centers would be built across the philippines, funded by private firms, including conglomerate san miguel corp and property firm megaworld. last year, manila opened what it called a  mega  drug rehabilitation facility to treat up to 10,000 patients and funded by a chinese tycoon.  the department of health submitted a budget of 759.6 million pesos for state managed rehabilitation facilities under the government s proposed 2018 spending plan, significantly less than this year s budget of 3.08 billion pesos. methamphetamine use for a year or more would shrink the brain of a person, duterte said in a speech in august last year, adding,  therefore he is no longer viable for rehabilitation.  he estimated there are already more than 3 million philippine drug users in a country of more than 100 million people.  the government s 13 drug abuse treatment and rehab facilities treated 14,733 out patients in 2016, up more than three times from the previous year, and close to 30,000 in  patients, up four percent over 2015, the health department says.   duterte has said the drugs war will continue and would be  unremitting as it will be unrelenting .

" zimbabwe s longstanding government and ruling party mouthpiece, the herald newspaper, has abruptly changed its tune on president robert mugabe s wife grace, confirmation of her political downfall. the herald often takes its marching orders from the information ministry. and it has always reported from the point of view of the winning faction in the ruling zanu pf, making it a reliable barometer of someone s political standing. in august, the paper ran a typically fawning portrait of grace under the headline  a loving mother of the nation.   loving mother, compassionate philanthropist, astute businesswoman, perceptive politician, remarkable patriot, these are all adjectives that can be used to describe the first lady dr grace mugabe,  the herald gushed. less than three months later and in the wake of a coup that threatens mugabe s presidency and has seen both he and grace expelled from zanu pf, her herald portrayal was starkly different.  grace mugabe lacked grooming and true motherhood as shown by her foul language,  the paper quoted the zanu pf s youth wing as saying.   we take exception to the vulgar language which had become part of mrs mugabe s vocabulary,  it quoted a youth league cadre as saying.  zimbabweans, many of whom are devoutly religious and culturally conservative, often take offense at profanities.  the piece featured an unflattering picture of an unsmiling grace   a sharp departure from the  loving mother  portrayal that included photos of her smiling and holding infants.  until the events of the past week, the political fortunes of grace   dubbed  gucci grace  for her reputed fondness shopping sprees   were on the rise, if the herald s coverage was anything to go on. in september 2014, the university of zimbabwe awarded her a phd   raising eyebrows as her academic prowess had previously been unknown. but in zimbabwe, the path to power is paved with academic letters. weeks later, one herald headline blared:  dr grace mugabe honored in song.  at the time, she was being shoe horned into the top position in zanu pf s women s league, and the song was entitled:  dr g mugabe for women s league secretary.  just 12 days ago, paper was reporting that the women s league was backing grace in her bid to become vice president. this was days after mugabe sacked his deputy emmerson mnangagwa, clearing the path for grace to assume the role and succeed her 93 year old husband. it was this tilt at power that triggered the army backlash.

" students at an islamic school that indonesian authorities have linked to islamic state returned home after villagers nearby demanded its closure, a school spokesman said on sunday. a reuters investigation published this month found at least eight staff and four students from the ibnu mas ud school in sukajaya, west java either traveled or tried to travel to syria to join the jihadist group between 2013 and 2016. spokesman jumadi told reuters the school was empty after the local police chief said failure to comply with the closure demands would lead to a  big demonstration  by residents from five surrounding districts. the school denies it supports is, or any other militant groups. it also says it does not advocate a violent or extreme version of islam. jumadi, who goes by only one name, said the police warning prompted the school to call parents to pick up the roughly 250 students. police could not be immediately reached for comment. one of the four students, hatf saiful rasul, left for syria when he was 11 and died fighting with is a year later in september 2016. his father, imprisoned militant syaiful anam, wrote that his son was inspired to travel by teachers and students of the school who had joined is. during the school s decade of operation in depok, outside jakarta, and then at sukajaya, at least another 18 people with links to it have been convicted or are now under arrest for militant plots and attacks in indonesia, reuters reported. they include former students, teachers, parents, founders and donors. during its investigation, reuters reviewed court documents, deeds of entitlement and interrogation reports, and interviewed counter terrorism police, donors and former militants. school head agus purwoko told reporters last week it only taught pupils  how to read and memorize the koran.    so ibnu mas ud, in a way, is a childcare. there are also parents who send their kids here because they are divorcing, going to jail, or facing other problems.  sukajaya village chief wahyudin sumardi told reuters in july that residents had been concerned about activities at the school for years. local resentment ignited when a member of the school s staff allegedly burned a red and white banner in the village celebrating indonesia s independence day on aug. 17. irate residents rallied outside the school, according to police, village chief wahyudin and school spokesman jumadi. jumadi agreed the next day to move or close the school in a month. but school head agus and some rights activists said he signed documents under duress and the school should not be closed on the basis of minor damage to patriotic bunting.  we asked the police to prevent the mass protesters taking the law into their own hands and to separate the activities of the children from allegations of involvement in terrorism,  said usman hamid, director of amnesty international indonesia. hamid said the school s closure would increase the students  chances of being radicalized.

" egypt s aviation minister will travel to russia to sign protocol agreements as early as friday to allow the resumption of russian flights that were suspended after the 2015 bombing of a tourist jet, egyptian sources and russia s minister said on thursday. russian president vladimir putin met egypt s president abdel fattah al sisi in cairo this week to discuss resuming flights and to sign a deal for a nuclear power plant as part of growing bilateral cooperation. two egyptian sources said the minister would leave on thursday for russia, but did not confirm the date for signing the agreement. the two governments may sign a deal on friday allowing to resume russian civilian flights, the tass news agency cited russian transport minister maxim sokolov as saying on thursday.  we expect that he (the egyptian minister)  will come on friday,  sokolov said, according to the ria news agency. asked whether an aviation security protocol with egypt will be signed, he said:  we expect that it will be signed.  moscow halted civilian air traffic to egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a russian metrojet flight leaving the tourist resort of sharm el sheikh and killing 224 people on board. the bombing and the russian suspension were blows to egypt s tourism industry, a key source of hard currency. the industry has been struggling after the upheaval triggered by a 2011 uprising that ended hosni mubarak s 30 year rule. the return of russian flights and tours could be a massive boost to tourist numbers that are still well below the 14.7 million visitors annually egypt saw in 2010 before the uprising a year later and the unrest that followed.

" republican front runner donald trump on thursday talked up “new york values” and urged his home state voters to give him a big win next week, but his rivals warned nominating trump could lead to disastrous losses to the democrats in the nov. 8 election. the new york billionaire is in danger of being forced to try to capture the republican presidential nomination through a contested convention because opposition from rivals ted cruz and john kasich is chipping away at his lead. as protesters chanted outside and waved signs against trump, trump told the new york state republican party’s gala that he needs the momentum that a victory in the state’s primary would bring next tuesday. “new york is so important,” trump said, trying to regain the momentum he lost after cruz defeated him in wisconsin last week and captured all of colorado’s delegates. trump identified himself with “new york values” of hard work and compassion after cruz charged trump’s version of these values are basically democratic positions. whether trump can win the 1,237 delegates he needs for the nomination is an open question as both cruz, a u.s. senator from texas, and ohio governor kasich, try to block him from getting enough delegates. they want to extend the fight to a contested convention in cleveland when republicans gather to formally choose their nominee in july. in his speech to the group, kasich tried to raise questions about trump without mentioning his name. he said republican candidates across the country would be at risk with a candidate with a negative message at the top of the ballot. trump has drawn many protests for policy positions that include building a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, deporting 11 million illegal immigrants and banning muslims temporarily from entering the united states. “we risk losing everything from the white house to the courthouse to the state house if we don’t advance a positive, uplifting, unifying message to this country. that is what we need to do,” said kasich, who spoke after trump. cruz, speaking after kasich, continued the theme, pointing to polls showing trump losing badly to democratic front runner hillary clinton and getting far less support from women and minority voters. cruz presented himself as a unity candidate who can bring the various wings of the party together. “if we nominate a candidate who loses to hillary clinton by double digits, who loses to women by 20 points, who loses hispanics by 40 points, who loses young people, we cannot win in the general (election),” said cruz. before the event started in the grand hyatt hotel near grand central station, a group of protesters stormed the hotel mezzanine with a banner that read: “nyc rejects the party of hate.” eleven of them were reported arrested. outside the hotel, many anti trump demonstrators called the new york billionaire businessman a fascist or white supremacist. they even teased him about his signature hairdo. “we shall over comb,” read one sign. others said: “deport trump,” “no allegiance for trump,” and “black lives matter.” a series of speakers addressed the protest crowd with a loudspeaker. police set up portable barriers to keep protesters separated from traffic and allow pedestrians to pass on busy 42nd street.  “although trump is from here, there is no place for him here,” said one of the speakers, nabil hassein, 27, of the group millions march nyc.  kasich scored a victory with the endorsement of former new york governor george pataki, an unsuccessful candidate for the  republican nomination for the nov. 8 election.the trump campaign got some good news when a florida prosecutor announced that trump’s campaign manager, corey lewandowski, would not be prosecuted on a misdemeanor battery charge involving a reporter he was accused of grabbing at an event last month.

" a somali refugee who had been on a watch list over extremist views faced five counts of attempted murder and terror charges on sunday after canadian police said he stabbed a police officer and ran down four pedestrians with a car in edmonton, alberta. the suspect, a 30 year old man whom police did not identify, had been investigated two years ago for promoting extremist ideology but was not deemed a threat, the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) said.  rcmp assistant commissioner marlin degrand said an  exhaustive investigation  into the man in 2015 did not uncover sufficient evidence to pursue charges. canadian media identified the suspect as abdulahi hasan sharif, although reuters was not immediately able to confirm his identity. police cordoned off an apartment block near downtown edmonton and plainclothes officers were seen carrying large bags of equipment into the building. the attacks in the western canadian city began when a chevy malibu hit a police officer standing in front of a football stadium at about 8:15 p.m. mountain time on saturday (10.15 p.m. et), sending him flying into the air. the driver got out of the car and stabbed the officer multiple times before fleeing, according to police accounts and surveillance footage of the incident. police identified the suspect when he was stopped at a checkpoint and his license showed that he was the owner of the malibu. he fled the checkpoint and was apprehended after a police chase across a downtown street, during which he hit four pedestrians. a flag of the islamic state militant group was found inside the malibu, said rod knecht, police chief of edmonton, alberta s provincial capital. edmonton mayor don iveson told reporters:  to the best of our knowledge, this was a lone wolf attack. there s no immediate cause for panic or concern.  u.s. national security agencies strongly leaned toward the conclusion that the suspect acted alone, although they were reviewing the matter, a u.s. official told reuters.  the police officer, who had stab wounds to the head and face, was released from a hospital on sunday along with two pedestrians. a third pedestrian was upgraded to stable from critical, while the fourth suffered a fractured skull and had regained consciousness. on sunday, two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern french port city of marseille in what officials describe as a  likely terrorist act . prime minister justin trudeau called the edmonton attack  another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against.  canada s government said it would keep the terrorist threat level at medium, where it has been since late 2014. the alberta muslim public affairs council denounced the attack and hundreds attended a sunday evening rally organized by the group.  these types of acts, whether terrorism or not, seek to divide communities. we have to show that s not going to happen, not in edmonton,  said group spokesman aurangzeb qureshi.  canada has been dealing in recent months with a surge in illegal border crossings by people seeking refugee status, which has renewed debate over whether it should tighten its borders.  the north american country has not experienced as much violence from extremist attacks as the united states and western european nations, but there have been several deadly incidents in recent years. in january, a french canadian university student was charged with murder after six people were shot and killed inside a quebec city mosque, in what trudeau called  a terrorist attack.  in august 2016, canadian police raided an ontario home and killed aaron driver, who they said was an islamic state supporter preparing an attack on a canadian city with a homemade bomb. in 2014, canada was stunned by two deadly attacks that police said were the work of homegrown radicals and led to tougher new anti terrorism measures.  a gunman killed a soldier at ottawa s national war memorial before launching an attack on the canadian parliament in october 2014. in the same week, a man ran down two soldiers in quebec, killing one. in 2015, a videotape attributed to al shabaab, a somali based islamist militant group behind a deadly 2013 attack on a kenyan shopping center, threatened north american malls, including the west edmonton mall.

" former u.s. vice presidential candidate sarah palin vowed on sunday to help unseat paul ryan, the top republican in the house of representatives, because of the his refusal to endorse presumptive republican nominee donald trump. palin, the former alaska governor and trump supporter, endorsed conservative businessman paul nehlen, who is challenging ryan, the house speaker, for his congressional seat in the wisconsin republican nominating contest on aug. 9. “i will do whatever i can for paul nehlen,” palin said in an interview with cnn. “this man is a hardworking guy, so in touch with the people.” though ryan is heavily favored to win the primary race against nehlen, palin predicted an upset in a race she said would shock washington’s political class. palin’s comments underscore the deep divisions within the party over trump, who effectively locked up his party’s nomination for president last week when his two remaining rivals, ted cruz and john kasich, dropped out of the race. palin said she believed ryan would get “cantored,” comparing him to former eric cantor, the former no. 2 republican in the house who was defeated in a 2014 primary by conservative dave brat, now a virginia congressman. ryan said last week he was not ready to support trump yet, saying that the new york real estate mogul needed to do more to unify the republican party. “paul ryan and his ilk, their problem is that they become so disconnected from the people they are elected to represent, as evidenced by paul ryan’s refusal to support the gop front runner, that we just said, ‘he’s our man,’” palin said. a poll in march by marquette university law school showed ryan with more than an 80 percent approval rating among wisconsin republicans. seen as an intellectual leader of the party’s conservative values, many inside the party believe he may mount his own white house run in the next presidential cycle. nehlen, like trump, wants to secure the southern border with mexico and withdraw from global trade deals. he told reuters in april that cantor’s defeat in 2014 “reinforced in my mind” that he could defeat ryan. asked if she would be willing to be vetted as a potential vice presidential candidate, palin said she recognizes many voters might not want her on the ticket and that she “wouldn’t want to be a burden” to trump’s candidacy. palin, who is popular with the tea party wing of the republican party, was tapped in 2008 to be the running mate for  former republican presidential nominee john mccain.

" zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa on wednesday promised zero tolerance in his government s push to punish corruption that stifled political freedom and economic growth under robert mugabe s 37 year rule. mnangagwa, giving his first state of the nation address since he assumed power last month following a de facto coup that ousted his 93 year old predecessor, has sought to draw a line under years of endemic corruption and impunity.  under pressure to deliver results, especially on an economy crippled by severe currency shortages, mnangagwa said reforms of a bloated state sector would be launched in early 2018.  with opposition parties calling for widespread political reforms before an election next year, he repeated a promise that his government would do everything in its power to ensure a credible, free and fair ballot.  corruption remains the major source of some of the problems we face as a country and its retarding impact on national development cannot be overemphasized,  mnangagwa told a joint sitting of the country s two houses of parliament.  on individual cases of corruption, every case must be investigated and punished in accordance with the dictates of our laws. there should be no sacred cows. my government will have zero tolerance towards corruption and this has already begun.  the latter was an apparent reference to comments last week he would name and shame those who failed to return stolen public funds after a three month amnesty ends in february.  his government is also pursuing corruption charges dating back over two decades against former finance minister ignatius chombo, a close ally of mugabe and his wife, grace. chombo, whose lawyer has said he will deny the charges, faces trial early next year. in the latter half of mugabe s rule the economy fell apart amid the violent and chaotic seizure of thousands of white owned commercial farms. billions of dollars of domestic debt issued to pay for a bloated civil service triggered a collapse in the value of zimbabwe s de facto currency and hyperinflation.     mnangagwa said the government would in the first quarter of next year announce a program to reform, commercialize or shut down some state owned firms he said had been  for a long time an albatross around the government s neck . zimbabwe s efforts to re engage international lenders and lure investors will rest on the credibility of next year s election, and the president again pledged a commitment to a free and fair vote. to level a playing field they say is skewed in favor of mnangagwa s zanu pf party, opposition parties have however challenged his army backed government to first enact a long list of electoral reforms. they include a new voters  roll, opposition access to public media, allowing an estimated three million zimbabweans living abroad to vote and international observers including the united nations.  we would like to see genuine, credible electoral reforms that will lead to free and fair elections and they must be underwritten and guaranteed by the international community,  tendai biti, leader of the opposition mdc alliance, told reporters ahead of mnangagwa s address. biti and other members of the alliance also criticized what they called the  militarization  of the government following the appointment of two former senior military officials to the new cabinet.  mnangagwa gave his clearest signal yet on tuesday that he would appoint as vice president constantino chiwenga, the military leader who led the coup that ousted mugabe. chris mutsvangwa, adviser to the president and the influential leader of the war veterans  association, has rejected the criticism of the appointments, saying they were not unique to zimbabwe.

" president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort has agreed to an $11.65 million bail agreement with the special counsel investigating trump campaign ties to russia, the longtime republican political consultant’s lawyer said on thursday. manafort, who was indicted along with a business associate richard gates in october, would be released from house arrest and electronic monitoring under the deal, lawyer kevin downing said in a filing in u.s. district court in washington. manafort, who has been confined to his virginia home, has agreed to forfeit four real estate properties worth about $11.65 million if there is a bail violation, the court document said. manafort previously had an unsecured $10 million “appearance bond” to guarantee he shows up to court.    agreement on bail had been reached with the office of special counsel robert mueller, downing said in the filing.  a spokesman for mueller could not immediately be reached for comment. manafort, who ran trump’s 2016 campaign for several months, and gates pleaded not guilty in october to a 12 count indictment by a federal grand jury. they face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine’s former pro russian government. the charges are part of mueller’s investigation into the conclusions of u.s. intelligence agencies that russia undertook a campaign of hacking and misinformation to tilt the election in trump’s favor and potential collusion by trump associates, allegations that moscow and the president deny. mueller and his attorneys have previously argued that the court should only agree to a bail agreement if manafort fully explains his finances to the court and that they considered him a flight risk. the four properties posted as bail are a bridgehampton, new york home valued at $4 million, a new york city property valued at $3.7 million, a florida property estimated at $1.25 million, and a home in virginia worth $2.7 million, the filing said. manafort’s wife, kathleen, and his daughter andrea have agreed to act as sureties on the appearance bond, it said. to address the issue of flight risk, manafort has agreed to not travel overseas, has handed over his passports, and will restrict his travel to florida, virginia, new york and washington d.c.  downing called the $11.65 million a “substantial portion” of manafort’s assets. “simply put, mr. manafort’s family would face severe economic consequences if he were not to appear as required.” ",0
" the kremlin said on monday it was worried that proposed new u.s. sanctions against moscow could hurt major investment projects with european partners, but said it was premature to say if and how it would retaliate. the white house said on sunday that u.s. president donald trump was open to signing legislation toughening sanctions on russia after senate and house leaders reached agreement on a bill late last week. that has raised concerns in germany which has already threatened to retaliate against the united states if the new sanctions end up penalising german firms, such as those involved with building nord stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying russian gas across the baltic. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on a conference call moscow was worried that u.s. sanctions could hit third countries, as well as russia, hard. “we are working with our european partners on implementing a number of large scale projects,” said peskov, when asked about the possible impact of the new u.s. sanctions on projects like  nord stream 2. “it goes without saying that we and our european partners attach great importance to finishing these projects and we will work towards this,” he said. “that is why discussions about ‘sanctions themes’ — which could potentially obstruct these projects — are a cause of concern for us.” peskov said the kremlin took “an extremely negative view” of the proposed new sanctions, calling the rhetoric surrounding them counter productive and damaging to u.s. russia ties. but he said moscow was for now ready to wait and see what the final shape of the sanctions might be. “as for the washington administration’s stance on sanctions, we have seen some corrections to it,” said peskov. “we will wait patiently ... until this position has been formulated unambiguously.” separately, peskov declined to comment on reports that the european union might discuss new sanctions against moscow over its delivery of siemens turbines to sanctioned crimea. reuters on monday quoted two diplomatic sources in brussels as saying that germany was urging the european union to add up to four more russian nationals and companies to the bloc’s sanctions blacklist over siemens gas turbines delivered to moscow annexed crimea.

" the united states issued about 40 percent fewer temporary visas in march to citizens of seven countries covered by president donald trump’s temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year, according to a reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on thursday.  at the same time, the data showed that the total of u.s. non immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was up by nearly 5 percent in march compared to the 2016 monthly average.  citizens of the seven muslim majority nations under the bans   iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen   received about 3,200 non immigrant visas in march 2017, compared to about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. trump's travel bans were later blocked by the courts.       the state department released the data to comply with a directive from trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world.  the department did not release data on the total number of all types of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of temporary visas for citizens of the seven countries is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times.  a state department official noted that “visa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level. visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons, such as during the summer and the winter holidays.”  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  march is neither a busy nor slow time for temporary visa issuances to people from the seven countries, several immigration lawyers said. therefore, the significant drops are notable, they said.  the data is preliminary and numbers could be subject to minor revision, the state department said.  previously, such data was only available in aggregate by fiscal year, and the department declined to break out march visa data from previous years.  nevertheless, some immigration attorneys said the numbers released on thursday provide a glimpse into how trump’s policies are affecting visa decisions.  “either there are many fewer people applying because they believe they will be denied, or a much higher rate of denials is already happening even though the executive orders have been blocked,” said william stock, president of the american immigration lawyers association.       trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make americans safer from attacks by terrorists, signed an executive order on jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the united states for 90 days.  the order was blocked by federal courts and the trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower travel ban effective march 16 which dropped iraq from the list. courts have also halted parts of the second order.  the number of non immigrant visas issued to iranians dropped to 1,572 in march from 2,450 per month on average in 2016 according to the data. iraqis received 684 such visas in march, compared to nearly twice that number per month on average in 2016, the data showed.  iranians also received fewer immigrant visas, which are granted to family members of u.s. citizens or those with jobs in the united states, than the average in previous years   393 received immigrant visas in march, compared to 644 on average per month in 2016 and nearly 600 on average per month in 2015 and 2014.  although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries, two of them saw the number of immigrant visas issued tick up slightly. forty one libyans received immigrant visas in march, compared to 32 per month on average in 2016. somalians received 171 visas in march compared to 150 on average in 2016.   immigration lawyers said that although the travel bans have been halted by courts for now, the administration’s vow to put stricter controls on immigration is likely to have changed how u.s. consulates evaluate visa applicants.  stephen pattison, a former state department consular official now working as an immigration attorney, said consulates “are going to probably err more on the side of denying some people that they’d be on the fence about.”  anecdotally, several u.s. based lawyers with iranian clients say their visa applications are taking longer to process and are being rejected more often since trump took office on jan. 20.  they cite shortages of interview appointments for iranians, interviews canceled at the last minute and longer “administrative processing” periods than they are accustomed to.  “if you can’t get an interview, you can’t get a visa,” said babak yousefzadeh, a san francisco based attorney and member of the board of directors of the iranian american bar association.  some iranians have decided that for now, it is not worth it to risk the expense and time of making u.s. visa applications, said kiyanoush razaghi, a maryland based immigration attorney.  in addition to paying a standard $160 visa application fee, iranians must typically travel to turkey, armenia or the united arab emirates for their interviews, since there is no u.s. diplomatic presence in iran.  “that’s a fundamental change that i am seeing, at least in the community and among the clients that i have,” razaghi said. “they have a general feeling that now is not a good time to apply for a visa.”  ",0
" the two u.s. senators representing california said on friday they will propose a federal task force to investigate the cause and response to the massive natural gas leak near los angeles. democratic senators barbara boxer and dianne feinstein announced they will introduce an amendment to a national energy bill being debated by the senate that would direct u.s. energy secretary ernest moniz to lead a task force that will recommend how to solve the ongoing methane leak and prevent future incidents. southern california gas company’s aliso canyon natural gas storage facility, which sprung a leak in october that has not yet been sealed, has raised alarms about the danger of aging oil and gas infrastructure. there is little oversight of the 400 underground natural gas storage facilities in 30 u.s. states. “we have a responsibility not only to address this leak, but also to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,” feinstein said in a statement. the amendment is one of nearly 100 that senators have introduced or plan to offer next week, as the senate works to pass the country’s first major energy bill in over eight years. the bill, which aims to modernize the country’s aging energy infrastructure, is one of the few in congress to have bipartisan support. senate majority leader mcconnell said he expects the legislation to pass late next week, after members vote on the list of amendments. the california senators’ proposal would direct moniz to lead a six member intergovernmental task force to study the impacts of the leak on affected communities as well as the environment and issue its findings within six months. those findings and subsequent updates would help agencies such as the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the environmental protection agency (epa) help respond to the leak. the task force would recommend whether to continue operations at aliso canyon and other facilities in close proximity to densely populated areas. other amendments the senate will consider next week include a proposal by michigan democrats to deal with another environmental crisis   lead water contamination in flint. the proposal would also direct $200 million for a research center to focus on the needs of children, and would also require the epa to warn the public of high lead levels in drinking water if a state fails to do so.

" opinion polls show vladimir putin is already a shoo in to win a fourth presidential term. but a ban on russia taking part in the winter olympics is likely to make support for him even stronger, by uniting voters around his message: the world is against us. putin announced on wednesday that he would run for re election in march s presidential vote, setting the stage for him to extend his dominance of russia s political landscape into a third decade. with ties between the kremlin and the west at their lowest point for years, the international olympic committee s decision to bar russia from the 2018 pyeongchang games over doping is seen in moscow as a humiliating and politically tinged act. putin, echoing his familiar refrain that his country is facing a treacherous western campaign to hold it back, said he had  no doubt  that the ioc s decision was  absolutely orchestrated and politically motivated .  russia will continue moving forwards, and nobody will ever be able to stop this forward movement,  putin said. konstantin kosachyov, head of the upper house of parliament s foreign affairs committee, had been among the first to cast the move as part of a western plot against russia, which sees sport as a barometer of geopolitical influence.  they are targeting our national honor ... our reputation ... and our interests. they (the west) bought out the traitors ... and orchestrated media hysteria,  kosachyov wrote on social media. the ioc ruling is also seen by many in russia as a personal affront to putin, who was re elected president in 2012 after  spending four years as prime minister because the constitution barred him from a third consecutive term as head of state.  the sport loving leader cast his hosting of the 2014 sochi winter olympics, at which the ioc says there was  unprecedented systematic manipulation  of the anti doping system, as a symbol of russia s success under his rule. but putin has often extracted political benefit from crises, and turned international setbacks into domestic triumphs, by accusing the west of gunning for russia and using this to inspire russians to unite.  outside pressure on russia, understood as politically motivated and orchestrated from the u.s., leads to more national cohesion,  dmitri trenin, director of the carnegie moscow center, said on wednesday.  various sanctions are being turned into instruments of nation building.  putin s popularity, supported by state television, is already high. opinion polls regularly give him an approval rating of around 80 percent.  but casting the ioc ban as a western plot to hurt russia, something he did when russian athletes were banned from last year s summer olympics in rio over doping, could help him mobilize the electorate. public anger over the ioc move could help putin overcome signs of voter apathy and ensure a high turnout which, in the tightly controlled limits of the russian political system, is seen as conferring legitimacy. there were early signs that fury over the ioc s decision was duly stirring patriotic fervor.  russia is a superpower,  alexander kudrashov, a member of the russian military historical society, told reuters on moscow s red square after the ioc ruling. without russia, he said, the olympics would not be valid.  he linked the decision to a western anti russian campaign which many russians believe took hold after russia annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014.    choosing between the people in crimea, who wept when the russian flag was run up and who were doomed to genocide, and  sportspeople taking first place on the podium, i choose the people who couldn t defend themselves,  kudrashov said.    blaming the west is an approach the kremlin has often used before when faced with international allegations of wrongdoing   over crimea s annexation, the shooting down of a malaysian passenger plane over ukraine in july 2014 and charges of meddling in eastern ukraine, where pro russian separatists  rebelled against rule from kiev after crimea was annexed. the tactic taps into russians  patriotism and makes putin almost bullet proof when it comes to scandal. the 65 year old former kgb agent is regarded by many voters as a tsar like father of the nation figure who has brought their country back from the brink of collapse.  when at the start of the year it seemed there was a window to repair relations with the west after the election of u.s. president donald trump, who said he wanted better ties, the narrative of russia versus the world was muted.  but when it became clear that u.s. allegations of russian meddling in trump s election precluded any rapprochement, putin doubled down on the narrative. in october, he launched a stinging critique of u.s. policy, listing what he called the biggest betrayals in u.s. russia relations.  sources close to the russian government say the ioc ban, along with continued western sanctions over ukraine and the prospect of new sanctions, will help the authorities rally voters around the banner of national unity which putin embodies.  outside pressure just makes us stronger,  said one such source who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. maria zakharova, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, set the tone on social media in comments that found ready support from many russians.  what haven t we been forced to suffer from our  partners  in the course of our history,  she wrote.  but they just can t bring us down. not via a world war, the collapse of the soviet union or sanctions ... we soak it up and survive.

" tentative plans for u.s. secretary of state john kerry to visit cuba before mid march for a human rights dialogue have been canceled, two u.s. officials said on thursday, amid concerns over the cuban government’s human rights record. kerry told a congressional hearing on feb. 23 that he might be in cuba “in the next week or two” to hold a dialogue on human rights, ahead of president barack obama’s scheduled trip to the island on march 21 22. the sources said the trip had been canceled because u.s. and cuban officials were deep in negotiations on issues including which dissidents obama might see in havana and that a trip in the timeframe kerry had mentioned was not seen as constructive. state department spokesman john kirby said he had no updates regarding kerry’s potential travel to cuba. “the secretary is still interested in visiting in the near future, and we are working with our cuban counterparts and our embassy to determine the best timeframe,” kirby said in an emailed statement. u.s. critics of obama’s opening to cuba have complained that the president has received little in return for restoring diplomatic relations with the former cold war foe. on feb. 24, the cuban government granted seven dissidents who were out of prison on parole a one time permission to travel outside the country in an apparent gesture to the united states ahead of obama’s historic visit.

" legislation approved by michigan lawmakers on thursday to bail out the detroit public schools (dps) will keep the district operating, but falls short on funding to fix its crumbling buildings, according to school officials. the bill package, approved over objections by democratic lawmakers, creates a new, debt free district governed by an elected school board, while leaving the current district in place solely to levy property taxes to pay off outstanding debt. dps, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. the american federation of teachers michigan and detroit federation of teachers criticized the lack of a bipartisan compromise in a joint statement on thursday. “these bills are a statement by non detroit republicans that they know what is best for detroit, a city that is overwhelmingly people of color,” the groups said. “it has been this attitude that resulted in detroit public schools’ massive debt, low academic performance and a ‘wild west’ system of school openings.” under the measures approved on thursday, michigan would commit $617 million from the state’s share of a tobacco settlement in annual increments of $72 million for the new detroit community school district. an emergency state loan for transition costs was capped at $150 million, with only $25 million of that amount available for capital improvements, less than the overall $200 million sought by dps. “we also look forward to working creatively with the governor’s office, the state superintendent, and the michigan department of education to identify the remainder of the critical resources necessary to educate our students,” dps state appointed transition manager steven rhodes said in a statement. a smaller bailout passed by the house in may raised concerns that dps would run out of cash later this summer. republican lawmakers contended the final $617 million bailout legislation would prevent dps from filing for municipal bankruptcy even though rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge, has said such a move would be ineffective because much of the district’s debt is guaranteed by the state. democrats objected to the absence of a detroit education commission to oversee the opening and closing of public and charter schools in detroit. the house and senate approved the package with a series of votes late wednesday and early thursday, sending the legislation to the desk of republican governor rick snyder, who signaled in a statement that he supports it.

" the vatican, at the start of a conference on protecting children from online sexual abuse, pledged on tuesday to seek the truth about one of its diplomats whom it recalled after he became suspected of possessing child pornography.  this is a very painful episode and a great trial for all involved,  said cardinal pietro parolin, the vatican s secretary of state and number two in the holy see. parolin was referring to the case of a monsignor who was recalled to the holy see from its washington embassy in august after the u.s. state department said he may have violated child pornography laws.  we are treating the case with the maximum seriousness, the maximum commitment and the maximum attention,  parolin told reporters as he arrived to deliver the conference s keynote address. he said the case was under judicial secrecy  to protect the investigation and to protect truth and justice . the vatican never identified the monsignor, who is also wanted in canada on suspicion of uploading child pornography from a social networking website in 2016. he is being investigated by vatican prosecutors and will stand trial in the vatican if indicted.   in his keynote speech, parolin said the catholic church wanted to  share the experience  it had acquired from dealing with its own scandals concerning priestly sexual abuse of children  so that it may prove useful for an ever greater good . he said all sectors of society, including  companies that promote and drive the development of the digital world,  have a responsibility to protect vulnerable children from forms of sexual abuse on the internet. the conference is also being addressed by jacqueline beauchere, the chief online safety officer for microsoft and antigone davis, head of global safety policy for facebook.  the three day conference, which will present its findings to pope francis on friday, will discuss themes such as bullying and the preying on children by pedophiles.  the kids aren t alright,  said baroness joanna shields, founder of britain s weprotect, an alliance to end child exploitation online.  if a child s first lesson in sexual education is a pornographic video, then this will become their reference point,  she said. professor ernesto caffo, the italian founder of a 30 year old hotline to report cases of endangered children, told the conference that 18 million children suffer sexual abuse in europe and that there were more than 57,000 urls containing child sexual abuse images. he said that in nearly 25 percent of cases, adult survivors of sexual abuse suffer from psychological problems, including depression, post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and self harm. there was an urgent need to provide specialized training for professionals working in education, caffo said.

" kenyan authorities will arrest and charge the sister of opposition leader raila odinga with incitement to violence after attacks on the election board, the chief prosecutor s office said on monday. odinga has pulled out of the re run of an election he was due to contest on thursday against president uhuru kenyatta, saying problems with the election board meant the vote would not be fair. he has called for protests and a boycott and on sunday said on twitter there would be  no election .  we resume our picketing at iebc (election board) offices countrywide on tuesday and wednesday. we maintain that there will be no election on thursday,  he said, without giving details. kenya is east africa s richest economy and a trade and transport gateway as well as a hub for diplomacy and security, so its stability is considered vital for the region. odinga s supporters disrupted a training session for election officials last week in the western city of kisumu, which is his political stronghold. they attacked election staff and destroyed tents and polling material, witnesses said. ruth odinga, who is the opposition leader s sister and a former deputy governor of kisumu county, was present at the protest, according to reuters witnesses. prosecutors instructed police to arrest her, opposition senator fred outa and others. she will be charged with incitement, destruction of property, obstructing election officers and trespassing in an electoral center, according to a letter that the director of public prosecution s office posted online.   the suspects should immediately be charged,  the letter said. neither ruth odinga nor outa could immediately be contacted for comment. the arrests could anger odinga s supporters and escalate tension over an election season that has divided the country and led to the deaths of at least 37 people since the first election was held on aug. 8 including four in the last two weeks. odinga says the election board had made insufficient reforms to prevent a repeat of the same mistakes that marred the previous presidential polls on aug. 8. kenyatta won that election but the supreme court last nullified the result, saying there had been procedural irregularities and a repeat must be held. the election board and kenyatta say the poll will be held regardless of whether odinga participates.

" a federal judge on friday struck down a string of wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the republican led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters. u.s. district judge james peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter id law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional. but peterson, in his 119 page ruling, said the requirements that wisconsin voters show either a photo identification or go through a special petition process had unfairly burdened minorities and needed to be reformed or replaced before the november presidential election. “to put it bluntly, wisconsin’s strict version of voter id law is a cure worse than the disease,” the judge wrote.  peterson left the voting rules intact for the aug 9. primary elections for federal, state and local offices, saying to change them less than two weeks in advance would be disruptive.  but his ruling was expected to impact the november presidential election in wisconsin, which could prove a crucial battleground state for democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump. peterson also struck down as unconstitutional limits on in person absentee voting, residency requirements and a ban on using expired student identification. wisconsin governor scott walker said in a tweet that he was “disappointed in the decision by an activist federal judge” and expected to file an appeal. a spokesman for one wisconsin institute, one of the two groups which filed the challenge, hailed peterson’s ruling as “a huge win not only for the plaintiffs but for democracy itself.”  wisconsin is one of several republican led states that have passed such voter id laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others.  among the nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state issued photo identification for voters, are georgia, indiana, texas and virginia. a u.s. appeals court judge earlier this month ruled the texas law discriminatory. the judge sent the case back to the lower court to examine whether the law had a discriminatory purpose and also asked the court for a short term fix for the november general election. republicans say voter id laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. democrats say the laws are really intended to make it harder for poor african americans and latinos, who tend to vote democrat, to vote.

" describing brexit as  nonsense , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble warned on monday against allowing europe to divide further along east west lines, saying this would be a  catastrophe . speaking at his 75th birthday party in the southwestern town of offenburg, schaeuble paused after mentioning britain in the context of europe. laughter broke out among the guests and, in an aside, he said britons were probably unhappy now with their vote last year to leave the eu.  if we were now to get new divisions between east and west after the british   it was nonsense to take such a decision and they are probably no longer happy with it   that would be a catastrophe,  he said.  we must be clear: we will only have a good future, history shows this, if we hold europe together, and that means all of europe,  he added. schaeuble appeared to be referring to a deepening divide between eastern countries like poland and hungary and their eu partners to the west over democratic values, acceptance of refugees and further european integration. french president emmanuel macron has been especially critical of governments in warsaw and budapest, which the eu says are distancing themselves from core european values like free speech and rule of law. germany, in part because of its history with poland, has been less openly critical of its eastern neighbors, but it has tacitly supported macron and steps by the eu to ratchet up pressure on governments in the east. many poles, especially rightwing supporters of the ruling law and justice party, are animated by a hatred of germans dating to world war two, though relations have warmed up since the end of communism when germany backed polish eu membership. last week, european commission chief jean claude juncker stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. juncker also attended schaeuble s party on monday and praised him for working to unify the eu.  schaeuble said those eu states that want to press ahead with closer integration must do so.  but we must also be careful that not only the big states decide. i learned that from kohl,  he said with reference to late chancellor helmut kohl, with whom he worked on the reunification of germany.

" u.n. human rights experts urged hong kong to uphold the fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly on tuesday when a court hears a final appeal of three prominent pro democracy activists convicted of unlawful assembly in 2014 mass protests. hong kong s highest court granted bail to two of the three activists, joshua wong and nathan law, on oct 24 pending their appeal scheduled for tuesday against their respective jail sentences of six months and eight months. hong kong s appeals court jailed wong, 21, law, 24 and alex chow, 27, leaders of the chinese ruled city s democracy movement, in august. chow did not apply for bail. their sentencing came as a blow to the youth led push for universal suffrage and prompted accusations of political interference.  we urge the hong kong court of final appeal to consider the cases of wong, law and chow in accordance with hong kong s obligations under international human rights law,  david kaye, u.n. special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and michel forst, u.n. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, said in a joint statement issued on monday in geneva.  we fear that if their sentences are upheld, this will have the effect of stifling the expression of dissenting opinions, the right to protest and the overall work of human rights defenders.   the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly protects people, especially those sharing dissenting opinions,  they said. the trio of activists helped lead the largely peaceful  umbrella movement  that blocked major roads for 79 days in 2014, demanding beijing grant hong kong full democracy. the independent u.n. experts also raised concerns that the hong kong secretary of justice had  previously intervened in the case, to apply for a change and review of the men s original lighter sentences .  we call on the hong kong authorities to respect the independence of judicial powers and the rule of law,  they said.  hong kong is a former british colony that returned to chinese rule in 1997 under a so called  one country, two systems  formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary. on saturday, china s largely rubber stamp parliament formally extended a law banning disrespect of the national anthem to cover hong kong, a move that critics have said undermined the chinese ruled city s autonomy and freedoms.

" the german military needs a  fifth generation  replacement for its tornado fighter jets that is hard to detect on enemy radars and can strike targets from a great distance, the chief of staff of the air force said on wednesday. lieutenant general karl muellner s comments are his clearest public statements to date on the tornado replacement program. they indicate a preference for lockheed martin corp s f 35 fighter jet, the only western aircraft that meets those requirements. the air force last month issued a formal request for information about the f 35, as well as three other jets: the f 15 and f/a 18e/f, both built by boeing co, and the european eurofighter typhoon. germany is kicking off the process of replacing its 85 tornado jets, which will go out of service around 2030. the program could be worth billions of euros for the winning bidder in coming years.  muellner told reuters germany would need to buy an off the shelf replacement that could enter service around 2025 to facilitate a smooth transition with the tornado, noting that did not leave enough time to develop a unique solution. but he said changing warfare requirements and the need for a credible deterrent meant the successor fighter had to be  low observable, and able to identify and strike targets from a great distance .   it will have to be a fifth generation jet to meet the full spectrum of our needs,  muellner said. many german allies in europe, including norway, the netherlands, britain, italy, turkey and denmark have selected the f 35 and some have received initial deliveries. belgium is expected to make a decision next year. lockheed is rolling out the red carpet, bringing its f 35 flight simulator to berlin and offering members of parliament, ministry and military officials and a journalists a chance to  fly  the stealthy single seat, single engine fighter. it even printed a new version of its standard f 35 lapel pin in the black, red and gold colors of germany s flag. any new fighter jet purchase would have to be approved by parliament in the next two years and a contract signed by 2020 or 2021 to ensure deliveries by 2025. a purchase of around 100 jets would help ensure german industry got a decent share of work on the program. steve over, lockheed s director of f 35 international business development, welcomed the comments and said lockheed stood ready to support the german government in its selection process. he said most f 35 foreign military sales involved some work for companies in the buying country. over told reuters the price of the aircraft would have dropped to around $80 million by the time germany would need to sign a contract. he said interest was growing in the f 35 given the changing threat environment.  it s really about giving nations a deterrent capability. because if you re got the capability to take an airplane into another country s airspace and they don t even know you re there, that s an incredible deterrent,  he said. muellner said he also strongly supported a franco german plan to develop a successor for its fleet of what will be 140  eurofighter typhoon jets, built by britain s bae systems plc, italy s leonardo and airbus. the project, unveiled in july, would help preserve critical technology skills in europe and allow europe to develop its own low observable technology, muellner said. airbus last week said that choosing an interim u.s. fighter that could eventually become a longer term commitment might interfere with the franco german fighter. industry sources said a decision to order the f 35 would be negative for airbus, which is part of the eurofighter consortium and is seen as one of the key partners in the franco german initiative announced earlier this year. muellner said the german air force had also committed to nato to provide a fleet of 14 electronic warfare aircraft by the middle of the next decade, which meant it would likely have to buy around 20 such jets. possible candidates could be the boeing ea 18 growler, a modified a400m transport plane that could provide stand off jamming capability, or a modified eurofighter, experts said. no decisions on that program have been made.

" slovenia s prime minister, miro cerar, has canceled a visit to croatia, accusing the neighboring state of reigniting a long running maritime dispute, his office said on friday. cerar called off next week s trip after his croatian counterpart, andrej plenkovic, told the u.n. general assembly that an international ruling on their shared waters was invalid. the permanent court of arbitration ruled in june that slovenia should have  uninterrupted access  to the sea it shares with croatia. croatia objected at the time, and plenkovic said he had merely repeated his country s position at the united nations on thursday.  in my speech there was nothing new about croatia s position, i mentioned the facts... we remain open for dialogue with slovenia and i invite cerar to come to croatia on some other date,  plenkovic told a cabinet session in zagreb. the countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up. the dispute, which centers on the bay of piran, held up croatian accession to the eu for many years. only after both parties agreed to arbitration was zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013   though it later withdrew from the proceedings. the hague based court ruled that slovenia gets the vast majority of the piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  in addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical mile wide and some 10 nautical mile long corridor through croatian waters to give slovenia much coveted direct access to international waters.

" the united nations migration agency is stepping up the rate at which it flies migrants home from libya, aiming to evacuate up to 15,000 in the final month of the year. the acceleration of returns is an attempt to ease severe overcrowding in detention centers, where numbers swelled after boat departures for italy from the smuggling hub of sabratha were largely blocked this year.   it also followed a cnn report showing migrants being sold for slave labor in libya, sparking an international outcry and calls for migrants to be given safe passage from the country.  the international organization for migration (iom) has already flown back more than 14,500 migrants to their countries of origin so far this year as part of its voluntary returns program. nigeria, guinea, gambia, mali and senegal have seen the highest numbers of returns. migrant flows through libya surged from 2014. more than 600,000 crossing the central mediterranean to italy over the past three years, but departures from libya s coast dropped sharply in july when armed groups in sabratha began preventing boats from leaving.  after clashes in the western city in september, thousands of migrants who had been held near the coast surfaced and were transferred to detention centers under the nominal control of the u.n. backed government in tripoli. numbers in about 16 centers rose to nearly 20,000, from 5,000 7,000 previously, leading to a worsening of already poor conditions.  we are seeing an increasing number of migrants wishing to return home especially after what happened in sabratha, it s all linked to sabratha,  said ashraf hassan, head of the iom returns program. in the aftermath of the cnn report and an african union visit to libya, some countries of origin have begun accepting charter flights returning migrants from libya for the first time. the iom has shortened procedures for screening migrants libya, collecting less statistical data and focusing on trying to ensure that migrants will not be put at risk by returning, hassan said. the agency hopes to have three charter flights leaving per day by dec. 11, increasing that to five flights by dec. 15. on tuesday nearly 400 migrants were flown back to nigeria on two flights from tripoli, the capital, and from the western city of misrata.

" twenty eight bodies with bullet wounds and torture marks were discovered on saturday in an area west of libya s capital that has recently seen clashes between rival armed factions, a local human rights group said.  ahmad hamza, of libya s national commission for human rights (nchr), said that the victims were fighters opposed to government aligned coalition forces, who had been arrested before they were killed.  locals found the bodies near a road in the town of alhira, 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital tripoli, hamza said on sunday. the town is in the wershafana area, where fighting broke out last week when a coalition of forces nominally aligned with the internationally recognized government in tripoli launched a campaign against rival armed groups, including loyalists of former libyan leader muammar gaddafi. the victims  families had not been allowed to receive the bodies for  reasons that are not known , hamza said.  according to the fact finding, monitoring and documentation section of nchr, there are signs of torture and they (the victims) were shot in the chest and head,  he said. the wershafana region has been largely cut off from the capital for several years and has become notorious for violence and criminal activity. the military council of zintan, a town southwest of tripoli that is participating in the campaign against rival armed groups, had said it aimed to deal with  murder, kidnapping and acts of barbarism in the region.  there was no immediate comment from the zintan military council after the bodies were discovered. the recent fighting displaced about 480 families, although around 100 have since returned to their homes, according to local authorities. libya has been in turmoil since gaddafi was ousted in a nato backed uprising in 2011, with loose armed alliances and rival governments vying for power.

" donald trump agreed on friday to pay $25 million to settle fraud lawsuits over his trump university real estate seminars, in what new york’s attorney general called a “stunning reversal” for the u.s. president elect. the lawsuits had dogged trump, who denied any wrongdoing,  throughout his campaign. they led to one of the more controversial moments of his run when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of mexican ancestry. the settlement was announced by new york attorney general eric schneiderman, who said it followed repeated refusals by trump “to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.” lawyers for trump had argued against students, who claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn trump’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand picked” instructors. three lawsuits relating to trump university will be covered by the deal: two class actions suits in california and a new york case brought by schneiderman. the agreement must still be approved by u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel in san diego. trump will not admit any wrongdoing under the agreement. his attorney, daniel petrocelli, acknowledged trump had previously vowed to fight the case. the settlement demonstrated trump’s desire to set his personal feelings aside in order to work on issues facing the county, petrocelli said. “president elect trump has laser focus on moving forward. it’s time to move on,” petrocelli told reporters on friday. schneiderman and attorneys for the students praised the deal. “today’s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by donald trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university,” schneiderman said in a statement. at a court hearing on friday, students’ attorney jason forge said that out of the $25 million proposed settlement, $4 million will be earmarked for students represented by schneiderman who were not part of the california class actions, as well as administrative costs. class action lawyers for the students will not seek attorneys fees, but reimbursement for costs, he said.  curiel, who is presiding over the two california cases, had urged both sides to settle. trump said during his election campaign that curiel, who was born in indiana to mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of trump’s campaign pledge to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border to control illegal immigration. in court on friday, trump lawyer petrocelli praised curiel for his hard work on the case.  curiel said he hoped the settlement could be part of a healing process after the u.s. election “that this country very sorely needs.” ",0

" a u.s. federal judge on monday issued a stern warning to president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort   to refrain from making statements to the media that could harm his right to a fair trial. u.s. district judge amy berman jackson chided manafort for ghost writing an opinion piece that was published last week in the kyiv post, an english language newspaper in ukraine, lauding manafort’s political work for ukraine. jackson said she would consider any similar future behavior to be a violation of her nov. 8 gag order not to discuss the case with the media or make public statements in ways that could affect the case’s outcome. jackson stopped short of granting a request from special counsel robert mueller to deny manafort’s proposal for more lenient bail terms, saying she would take manafort’s proposal to lift his house arrest in exchange for posting four real estate properties as collateral under advisement and rule at a later date. prosecutors had previously asked her to deny manafort’s request, saying his behind the scenes ghost writing violated her order and raised issues of trust.  “mr. manafort, that order applies to you, and not just your lawyer,” jackson said.  she added that the op ed, while not published in a united states newspaper, could potentially taint a local jury pool because of the global nature of media. “all that has to happen is for that favorable article, which is going to ... look on its face to be entirely independent, but is actually in part a message crafted and shaped by you ... is to have somebody you know post it on facebook, twitter or a blog, and you have accomplished your goal, given the power of retweeting,” she said. manafort and his business associate rick gates are facing charges including conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government. jackson set the next status conference hearing for jan. 16. jackson said she has some outstanding concerns about manafort’s proposed bail package, including his reliance on the real estate website zillow to come up with some of the property value estimates. manafort earlier this month pledged about $8 million in real estate assets in new york city and elsewhere, as well as life insurance worth about $4.5 million as security for bond. in a court filing on monday, manafort provided information including real estate tax assessments, appraised market values and comparable sales data for the properties in new york, virginia and florida. many items cited zillow. jackson also expressed frustration that the defendants were not always giving pre trial services ample notice about their whereabouts, saying, “it has to be more than an hour in advance.” she added that gates has repeatedly filed requests to get out of house arrest on the weekends to go to his children’s’ sporting events, and she urged his lawyers to reach a bail agreement with the government so the court could “get out of the business of monitoring soccer practice.”  ",0

" secretary of state john kerry urged congress on thursday not to rush to renew the iran sanctions act (isa), a broad u.s. law imposing sanctions over iran’s nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of the year. “i wouldn’t advise that for a number of reasons,” kerry told the house of representatives foreign affairs committee at a hearing on the state department’s budget. many lawmakers have been pushing to renew the isa quickly, to send a message to tehran that congress is still taking a hard line over its nuclear program, missile development and human rights record. the effort could set up another showdown over iran between the administration and the republicans who control congress. every republican in congress, and several of president barack obama’s fellow democrats, opposed the agreement announced in july in which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. house republicans early this month passed legislation to restrict obama’s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact. the senate has not taken it up and obama has threatened a veto, and lawmakers are discussing alternatives. “if the administration isn’t supportive of this renewal (of the isa), not only are we preventing the possibility of a snapback, but from the standpoint of myself and many of the members of this committee, we’re also giving relief on missiles,” said representative ed royce, the republican committee chairman. iran tested ballistic missile technology in october, prompting the united states to impose new sanctions in january, but many members of congress want a stronger response. kerry said lawmakers should allow more time to see how iran responds to the international nuclear agreement, which went into effect only last month. he argued that sanctions can be imposed quickly if iran is found to violate terms of the nuclear deal or other agreements. kerry was asked about reports that iran will enjoy a windfall of up to $150 billion from the nuclear agreement as money frozen under the sanctions regime is released. he said the total likely would be about one third of that level, and currently is far lower. “our estimates are it’s somewhere in the vicinity of $50 to $55 billion at some point in time but it’s way below that right now.” kerry said. “and in fact, they are complaining about the slowness with which there has been a process of repatriation.” ",0

" former republican presidential candidate ted cruz returned to his job in the u.s. senate on tuesday with a warning to washington that the turbulent primary race was a wake up call. “all across this country people are hungry for change. this election cycle should be a wake up call to washington, d.c.,” the senator from texas said outside his office. “the frustration and volcanic anger with washington was echoed throughout this election.” presumptive republican nominee donald trump and democratic u.s. senator bernie sanders have upended expectations in their respective presidential campaigns, tapping into voter anger at establishment politicians in washington. cruz, a favorite of the conservative tea party movement, also tried to position himself as an outsider.  however, he dropped out of the republican race a week ago after a crushing loss in indiana and a brutal campaign in which trump attacked cruz’s wife and father and constantly derided the senator as “lyin’ ted.” cruz ruled out a third party candidacy, and said the democratic process had run its course. earlier on tuesday, cruz welcomed the idea of tossing his hat back into the ring in a lighthearted exchange with a staunch supporter, conservative radio host glenn beck.  beck, who campaigned heavily for cruz in the senator’s quest for the republican nomination, asked the 45 year old texan whether he would consider getting back into the race if he won nebraska’s primary on tuesday. “i am not holding my breath,” cruz said to laughter on beck’s show on theblaze radio network. “my assumption is that that will not happen. ... the reason we suspended the race last week is with indiana’s loss i didn’t see a viable path to victory.”  “if that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.” trump’s victory in indiana last tuesday pushed cruz and ohio governor john kasich out of the republican race and put the brakes on the “stop trump” movements sparked by his unorthodox candidacy.  trump campaign adviser sam clovis dismissed the possibility of cruz re entering the race as highly unlikely. “i think if ted has a future in republican politics in this country, i think he’ll want to preserve that,” clovis told cnn. cruz may be hoping to put his conservative imprint on the party’s july 18 21 national convention in cleveland. on monday, he said he would not release delegates he had won in kansas, oklahoma and texas, according to news reports.  trump needs 1,237 delegates, a majority of the delegates at the convention, to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, and it is not guaranteed he will win them in the remaining nominating contests. asked if he would endorse trump, cruz said every voter needs to make their own choice and they do not need to make it now. “the republican convention isn’t for another two and a half months; the election isn’t for another six months,” the senator said. “i think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do.” ",0
" a week after president donald trump said he was close to picking a new fbi director to replace the one he fired, the white house has decided to renew its search, cnn reported on wednesday. the republican president said last thursday he was “very close” to selecting a new head of the federal bureau of investigation to replace james comey, and that former senator joseph lieberman was among the top candidates. trump left the following day on his first trip abroad as president, a nine day visit to the middle east and europe, without naming a replacement.  citing an unidentified senior administration official, cnn said trump now wants to consider additional candidates for the job. the white house and lieberman did not respond to requests for comment. a spokesperson for the justice department, which has played a lead role in the search, said it had no further information. trump fired comey on may 9 in a surprise announcement that sparked days of political turmoil. comey was leading the fbi’s probe of possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russian operatives whom u.s. intelligence officials say meddled in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. trump and russia deny any collusion. lieberman is a senior counsel at the new york based law firm of kasowitz benson torres llp, which has represented trump on various matters for years.  trump has tapped one of the firm’s partners, marc kasowitz, to be his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his presidential campaign worked with russia to defeat democratic candidate hillary clinton. if trump were to nominate lieberman, lieberman might not have been able to participate in the russia investigation for a period of two years without white house and justice department waivers, according to kathleen clark, a professor of legal ethics at washington university school of law. a federal regulation restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm’s clients for one year. this cooling off period was extended to two years by an executive order trump signed in january. white house spokesman sean spicer said last wednesday that trump was scheduled to interview four candidates for the position before departing on his trip: lieberman; acting fbi director andrew mccabe; former oklahoma governor frank keating; and former senior fbi official richard mcfeely.

" a coalition of supporters of self driving cars said on tuesday that it will run ads this week in social media and washington newspapers, in an effort to convince the u.s. congress to adopt sweeping legislation to boost the nascent industry. the ads are being placed by the coalition for future mobility, which was formed in july by trade groups representing major automakers, along with other advocates for self driving cars, as congress began serious consideration of bills relating to autonomous vehicles. they want the senate to pass a bill that would speed up the use of self driving cars by easing safety regulations, and bar states from blocking such vehicles. the house of representatives has already unanimously approved a bill. the senate is considering a similar draft measure, but is divided over whether to include large commercial trucks, a dispute that could prevent the bill from winning approval this year.  the house measure, which only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg), would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. the cap would rise over three years to 100,000 vehicles annually. as part of the campaign, major automakers will be contacting their employees and retirees, asking them to reach out to their members of congress, a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers said. the coalition launched a website and will use targeted facebook advertising, focusing on groups who could benefit from autonomous vehicles, such as disabled veterans. one of the print ads seen by reuters features a man dressed in military fatigues sitting in a wheelchair. the ad says: “he fought for our freedom. let’s give him back his.” that “will only become a reality if congress acts,” the ad says. the coalition includes trade groups representing automakers general motors co, toyota motor corp and volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de), as well as organizations including ride sharing firm lyft inc, the telecommunications industry association, the american council of the blind and a drone industry group.      senate aides have been negotiating in recent days but have not reached agreement. a senate panel could take up the issue at an oct. 4 hearing, aides say. auto industry leaders say 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self driving vehicles replaced human drivers. self driving proponents say 94 percent of u.s. car crashes are the result of human error and argue self driving cars could dramatically cut the 35,000 annual road deaths.

" president donald trump’s administration plans to consider almost all illegal immigrants subject to deportation, but will leave protections in place for immigrants known as “dreamers” who entered the united states illegally as children, according to official guidelines released on tuesday. the department of homeland security guidance to immigration agents is part of a broader border security and immigration enforcement plan in executive orders that republican trump signed on jan. 25.  former president barack obama, a democrat, issued an executive order in 2012 that protected 750,000 immigrants who had been brought into the united states illegally by their parents. trump has said the issue is “very difficult” for him.  trump campaigned on a pledge to get tougher on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the united states, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build a wall on the border with mexico and to stop potential terrorists from entering the country. trump’s planned measures against illegal immigrants have drawn protests, such as an event last week that activists called “a day without immigrants” to highlight the importance of  foreign born people, who account for 13 percent of the u.s. population, or more than 40 million naturalized american citizens. a banner declaring “refugees welcome” was posted on the base of the statue of liberty, a symbol of american acceptance of immigrants, before park rangers removed it on tuesday, wabc television reported. dhs officials, on a conference call with reporters, said that although any immigrant in the country illegally could be deported, the agency will prioritize those deemed a threat. these include recent entrants, those convicted of a crime and people charged but not convicted of a crime. some details of the guidelines were detailed in a draft memo seen on saturday.   many of the instructions will not be implemented immediately because they depend on congress, a public comment period or negotiations with other nations, the officials said. mexican immigration officials immediately objected to part of the new rules. the guidance also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more u.s. immigration and customs (ice) agents and 5,000 more u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) agents. the dhs will need to publish a notice in the federal register subject to review in order to implement one part of the plan that calls on ice agents to increase the number of immigrants who are not given a hearing before being deported.  the new rules would subject immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to “expedited removal.” currently, only migrants apprehended near a u.s. border who cannot show they have been in the country more than 14 days are subject to rapid removal.  the memos also instruct ice to detain migrants who are awaiting a court decision on whether they will be deported or granted relief, such as asylum. dhs officials said they are reviewing what jurisdictions may have laws in place that prevent the amount of time immigrants can be held. the agency also plans to send non mexican migrants crossing the southern u.s. border back into mexico as they await a decision on their case. the dhs officials said this plan would be dependent on partnerships with the mexican government and would not be implemented overnight.  the guidelines were released a day before u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and homeland security secretary john kelly were due in mexico city for talks with president enrique pena nieto and mexican officials. an official from mexico’s foreign ministry said the government would tell kelly’s team to that it was “impossible” for mexico to accept deportees or asylum applicants from foreign countries, and would ask them to explain their plan. the deportation of mexicans would be one of the government’s major concerns at the meeting, said the official, who declined to be named. a spokeswoman from the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" the russian central bank held its key interest rate unchanged at 9 percent on friday, citing geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures, but it indicated rate cuts would follow in the coming months. facing new u.s. sanctions and a recent spike in food prices, the central bank opted for a cautious no change decision, even though inflation, its key area of focus, has nearly slowed to its 4 percent target. the inflation slowdown has allowed the central bank to cut benchmark borrowing costs three times this year, helping the economy recover following two years of contraction. “volatility in global commodity and financial markets, as well as exchange rate dynamics amid elevated geopolitical risks may have negative implications for exchange rate and inflation expectations,” the central bank said in a statement. the u.s. senate this week voted almost unanimously to slap new sanctions on russia and backed a provision that allows congress to stop any effort by president donald trump to ease existing sanctions. although analysts have played down the potential economic impact of the new sanctions, the rouble has been dragged lower in recent days because of them. if rouble weakness were to intensify, that would represent an inflation risk. although annual inflation unexpectedly rose from 4.1 percent in may to 4.4 percent last month because of higher food prices, the central bank said it still saw room to cut the key rate in the second half of 2017 as a new harvest would help lower prices for fruit and vegetables. “while making its decision hereinafter, the bank of russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast,” the bank said. keeping its 2017 economic growth forecast unchanged at 1.3 1.8 percent, the central bank noted that a decline in inflation expectations had come to an end. “in order to maintain inflation close to the 4 percent target, the bank of russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy,” said the bank, which has previously promised to keep its key rate up to 3 percentage points above inflation. “all in all, extreme caution is the focus at the cbr,” dmitry polevoy, chief economist at ing bank in moscow, said in a research note. with the threat of more u.s. sanctions looming, the central bank likely wants to take no risks with financial stability by keeping rates stable, said tim ash, senior strategist at bluebay asset management. the bank is seen cutting its main lending rate to 8.25 percent by the end of the year, a reuters poll showed last month. capital economics said it expected the central bank to cut rates as soon as its next board meeting, scheduled for sept. 15, as inflation would fall back towards the central bank’s target by year end.

" british prime minister theresa may gave poland a rare dose of big power support on thursday by saying that its constitution was its own affair, a sharply different tone to that of the european union which has scolded warsaw over judicial reforms. the eu executive launched an unprecedented action against poland on wednesday, calling on other eu member states to prepare to sanction warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that brussels says pose a threat to democracy. when asked about the commission s move to deploy the  nuclear option  under article 7 of the 2009 lisbon treaty, may said:  these constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily a matter for the individual country concerned.  speaking alongside polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki in warsaw, may said:  across europe we have collective belief in the rule of law.    i welcome the fact that prime minister morawiecki has indicated that he will be speaking with the european commission and i hope that that will lead to a satisfactory resolution.  while the eu executive has censured polish ruling party leader jaroslaw kaczynski s push to have control of judicial appointments, may is seeking to court poland as an ally in brexit negotiations and key military partner against russia. poland has said reforms are necessary while like minded allies in hungary have indicated they will veto the ultimate sanction of suspending poland s voting rights in the bloc. at one point, a translator s slip made morawiecki appear to cast may as  madame brexit , though in fact he said in polish:  as madame pm said, brexit is brexit . may said britain and poland had signed a defense and security cooperation treaty which deepens cooperation on training, information sharing and capability development. on the eve of a visit by foreign secretary boris johnson to moscow, may said vladimir putin s kremlin was trying to weaponise information and undermine a rules based international system.  we are both deeply concerned by russia s attempts to weaponise information,  she told reporters.  the kremlin is seeking to undermine the international rules based system and it will not succeed.  morawiecki said he hoped france and germany were aiming to work out the best solution with britain as it leaves the eu  i have deep hopes and conviction that our french and german partners aim to work out the best solution in this new, not easy situation that we are in with respect to brexit,  morawiecki said.

" a tennessee state lawmaker was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four year period in a state attorney general’s report released on wednesday.  republican representative jeremy durham repeatedly made unwelcomed advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists since being elected in 2012, according to a report issued to a legislative committee investigating his conduct. durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said, and he was not immediately available for comment. “the investigation has been a politically motivated, unfair and unconstitutional process,” said durham’s attorney bill harbison in a statement to the nashville cbs affiliate news channel 5. the report details interviews with 22 unnamed women who described numerous occasions when the married legislator flirted and made suggestive sexual comments or physical advances toward them.  in one case, durham had sex with an 20 year old campaign worker in his legislative office and again in his home. on several occasions, he sent text messages or used social media to make “inappropriate” comments to several women.  one of the women described the messages as “terribly inappropriate” while another said his behavior “creeped her out.” a lobbyist told investigators that durham suggested he would vote for a bill she was promoting if she entertained his advances. “i’m for your bill but i’m going to expect something in return,” he told her according to the report.  in a memo attached to the report, the committee said it will leave durham’s fate to the voters as he is up for re election in november.

" president emmanuel macron, conscious of criticism of france s policy on egypt, will raise his concerns over human rights when he meets egyptian leader abdel fattah al sisi in paris next week, his office said on thursday. the two countries have nurtured closer economic and military ties in recent years and with sisi s rise to power that relationship has improved with both sides concerned by the political vacuum in libya and the threat from jihadist groups in egypt. but human rights organizations at home and overseas have accused france under macron of remaining silent in the face of increasing violations of freedoms by sisi s government as the 2018 presidential elections approach.  this first meeting ... will enable them to discuss subjects of common interest such as regional crises and the fight against terrorism, but also the human rights situation which france is especially vigilant about,  the presidency said in a statement referring to sisi s oct 23 25 visit. rights  groups are in particular critical of the relationship between foreign minister jean yves le drian, who in his previous role as defense minister, developed a personal relationship with sisi, and say paris has abandoned its principles for economic and security interests. french officials dismiss this criticism and say the new administration is following a policy of not openly criticizing countries over human rights so as to be more efficient in private and work on a case by case basis.  in a report in september, human rights watch (hrw) denounced  widespread and systematic  use of torture by egyptian security forces. the united nations on oct. 13  condemned an anti gay crackdown in egypt.  hrw earlier slammed french  indulgence  towards repression in egypt.  according to two ngo officials aware of talks between macron and human rights groups on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly in september, macron had told them that while he acknowledged the worsening human rights situation in egypt, his priority was to ensure sisi continued to fight terrorist groups. faced with the lack of progress in respecting human rights and on democratic standards, the united states decided in august to freeze the payment of $195 million in military aid.  under the previous government, france concluded several major military agreements with egypt, including the sale of 24 rafale combat aircraft, a multi mission frigate and two mistral warships in contracts worth some six billion euros.

" heathrow airport announced a public consultation on the proposed development of a third runway at europe s biggest airport, saying it aimed to mitigate the environmental impact of expansion. prime minister theresa may backed a $22 billion expansion of the london hub in october 2016, after decades of government indecision. but the plan has been controversial, with critics highlighting the possible impact on air quality in london and noise levels in the local community. heathrow said it would seek the views of locals on the environmental impact of expansion and how the airspace around heathrow is managed.  over the past year, we ve been working hard to evolve our expansion plans and have come up with several new options to deliver it more responsibly and affordably,  said the airport s executive director for expansion emma gilthorpe.     the new discussions are separate from a previously announced government consultation on a national policy statement on airports, and is focused on the airport s plans for infrastructure and the impact on the local community. transport secretary chris grayling has said that the government aims to give the go ahead to the new runway in the first half of 2018. the latest consultation will launch on jan. 17 and run for 10 weeks.

" scandals enveloping u.s. president donald trump have left republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly gloomy about the prospects for passing sweeping tax cuts, a rollback of obamacare  and an ambitious infrastructure program. with the white house and both chambers of the u.s. congress under republican control, party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans, with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities. but four months into trump’s tenure, only limited progress has been made. the house of representatives passed a measure to rewrite obamacare, but the senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue. lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform. in addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between trump’s 2016 campaign team and russia, the u.s. justice department on wednesday named former fbi director robert mueller to investigate the matter. “it’s the elephant in the room right now,” said republican representative pat tiberi. “the smartest minds in the white house know that, whether it’s tax reform or anything else on the public policy front. it’s hard enough to get things done in the u.s. capitol under the best of circumstances.” the house ways and means committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on thursday. key administration and congressional leaders met wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward. but they remain a long way from signing a bill into law. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that “less drama from the white house” was needed to advance legislative priorities.  republican senator lindsey graham told reporters on wednesday that the legislative process had “pretty much ground to a halt” amid the tumult in washington. republican representative steve womack said it was important for committees investigating the russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for congress to move on to other issues. “any time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda, it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the american people,” womack said. at a news conference on wednesday, house speaker paul ryan urged his colleagues to “seize this moment” to pass tax reform. but instead of discussing tax rates and structures, ryan was faced with a series of questions about james comey, who trump fired as director of the federal bureau of investigation last week, and the russia investigation. several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved.  “my worry level has grown considerably,” one lobbyist said. some lobbyists suggested that congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for.  “when this all started, the thing we heard from the hill was ‘transformative tax reform,’” said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform. “i think as time passes, tax reform is going to look much different, that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform.”  ",0

" russia accused the united states on wednesday of allowing islamic state to operate  under its nose  in syria, saying washington was letting the militant group move about freely in an area abutting a u.s. military base. the allegations, made by russia s defense ministry, center on a u.s. military base at tanf, a strategic syrian highway border crossing with iraq in the south of the country.  russia says the u.s. base is illegal and that it and the area around it have become  a black hole  where militants operate unhindered.  the united states says the tanf facility is a temporary base used to train partner forces to fight against islamic state. pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning on tuesday said washington remained committed to killing off islamic state and denying it safe havens and the ability to carry out strikes. but major general igor konashenkov, a spokesman for the russian defense ministry, said moscow wanted to know how around 300 islamic state militants in pickup trucks had passed through the u.s. controlled area and tried to block the highway between damascus and deir al zor used to supply syrian forces. he said the u.s. had not yet given an explanation.   we suggest the american side also explain about another incidence of their  selective blindness  towards militants operating under their nose,  konashenkov said in a statement. he said about 600 militants based in a refugee camp in the u.s. controlled area had driven en masse to a former customs post called tafas on the syrian jordanian border earlier this month and seized food and medical supplies meant for locals.  you don t need to be an expert to now forecast an attempt to rupture the peace agreement in the southern de escalation zone,  said konashenkov.  we issue a warning. all responsibility for sabotaging the peace process will lay exclusively with the american side.

" former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara took several shots at the administration of president donald trump on thursday, calling for “facts not falsehoods” as the basis for political discourse and a more welcoming stance towards immigrants in his first public speaking event since being fired one month ago. bharara sprinkled the hour long speech with humor, including a joke about the size of the crowd clearly aimed at trump. but bharara also made a series of thinly veiled criticisms of the new administration, referring multiple times to trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” in washington. “you don’t drain a swamp with a slogan. you don’t drain it by replacing one set of partisans with another. you don’t replace muck with muck,” bharara, 48, said at the cooper union in new york.  “to drain a swamp you need an army corps of engineers, experts schooled in service and serious purpose. not do nothing, say anything, neophyte opportunists who know a lot about how to bully and bluster but not so much about truth, justice and fairness.”  bharara was fired by trump on march 11 after refusing to step down. while he was among 46 u.s. attorneys told to submit their resignations, his dismissal was a surprise because trump had asked him in november to stay in the job. bharara has said it was not made clear to him at first whether or not he was being dismissed. he joked about that initial confusion with a reference to trump’s tv reality show in which he regularly fired people on the spot. “i don’t really understand why this was such a big deal, especially to this white house. i had thought that was what donald trump was good at,” bharara said.  as the chief federal prosecutor for the southern district of new york, bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white collar criminal cases, as well as cases involving national security. he said he was equally proud of the less high profile work his office did to combat gangs and consumer fraud. bharara said he expected his successor to carry on with the office’s reputation for independence. he did not comment on who his possible successor. as for his own future, bharara ruled out running for public office. “i don’t have any plans to enter politics just like i have no plans to join the circus. and i mean no offence to the circus.”  ",0
" liberia s supreme court on monday put a presidential run off on hold until the electoral commission can investigate claims of irregularities and alleged fraud in last month s first round of voting.  former footballer george weah was initially set to face vice president joseph boakai on tuesday to determine who will replace nobel peace prize laureate ellen johnson sirleaf. a successful vote would be liberia s first democratic transfer of power in over 70 years. but preparations for the second round were halted last week when the supreme court announced it was examining a complaint by the liberty party of third placed candidate charles brumskine. the supreme court s order for a full investigation into the allegations could push back the run off date by weeks or even result in a re run of the first round.   the nec (national elections commission) is stopped and prohibited from conducting the run off election until the complaint filed by the petitioners is investigated by the nec,  the supreme court ruling said.      addressing the supreme court last week, brumskine cited  gross irregularities  in the first round and accused nec officials of fraud.  the nec has denied wrongdoing and said the election was largely fair. international observers say they saw no major problems with the vote. but a growing chorus of parties have expressed doubt about the vote, including boakai s ruling unity party, which last week accused johnson sirleaf, one of its own members, of trying to influence the vote. she rejected the allegation.   the course we pursue is not about charles walker brumskine. it is not about the liberty party. it is greater than all of us. it is about our country,  brumskine said following the supreme court ruling.  janga kowo, secretary general of weah s cdc party, called upon supporters to remain calm and allow the legal process to run its course. the unity party had no immediate comment on monday s ruling.   expectations of a poll delay have increased tensions in liberia, where many are eager for change after 12 years of johnson sirleaf s rule. her tenure cemented peace after a long civil war, but many liberians say she did little to alleviate widespread poverty despite vast iron ore reserves.  it is now unclear when the run off will take place.  the nec has until mid november to rule on the liberty party s complaint. if it is rejected, brumskine could still take the case back before the supreme court with an appeal, potentially pushing the date of the second round into december.  the court also has the option of calling a new first round vote to be held within 60 days.

" the top risk to u.s. growth would come if u.s. president elect donald trump keeps his protectionist promises, according to a reuters poll that shows economists have not joined in the market exuberance since the shock november vote. for most of his campaign and after the election, trump vowed to make sweeping changes to u.s. trade and immigration policy, threatened to impose steep tariffs on chinese imports and proposed hefty tax cuts. while financial markets have retreated in the past week and hopes of a sudden spurt in inflation have faded, u.s. 10 year treasury yields are still up more than 25 percent since election day, and stocks have hit record highs. still, more than two thirds of the 70 respondents to the question in the reuters survey taken over the past week said trump’s protectionist policies were the biggest threat to the world’s largest economy this year. “there is no question that near the top of the list of downside risks is the potential for more follow through on the anti free trade rhetoric,” said jim o’sullivan of high frequency economics. “i am kind of assuming that the (incoming) administration will be practical on this,” said o’sullivan, the top forecaster of u.s. economic data in reuters polls for 2016, the second year in a row he achieved that distinction. the strong dollar, which hit a 14 year high early this month and is up close to 6 percent since trump was elected, poses an additional near term risk.  worries around the globe over trump’s confrontational style and a strengthening dollar are likely to be key themes among political and business leaders at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, this week. sweeping tax cuts for businesses and individuals, and the prospect of some infrastructure spending, have also not brightened prospects for u.s. economic growth, which trump has said he aimed to boost to 3.5 percent. more than 80 percent of respondents said “no” when asked if now was the right time for such aggressive tax cuts, with the economy close to full employment. the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in december. the latest poll estimated growth slowed to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.5 percent in the third quarter. through 2017, economists predicted the economy would expand at an annual rate of 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent each quarter, just 0.1 percentage point higher than the previous estimate. the full year median was 2.3 percent. the most optimistic growth forecast for any point in 2017 was 4.1 percent, far short of the post financial crisis peak of 5.6 percent hit in the fourth quarter of 2009. “obviously people have been assuming the growth sapping parts (protectionist measures) are not followed through, but they may have run ahead of themselves in predicting how much stimulus will be enacted and how much growth will be boosted,” said o’sullivan, who was also the most optimistic on growth among the top forecasters. a little fewer than one third of the respondents, including three of the top 10 u.s. economy forecasters in reuters polls last year, upgraded their 2017 growth outlooks in the latest poll. many of them, like o’sullivan, said it was mainly on the assumption trump would not follow through on his restrictive trade agenda and instead focus on boosting growth through fiscal measures. while those projected growth rates may be considered healthy for the economy at such a late stage of the recovery cycle, they could do little to boost inflation much beyond the federal reserve’s 2 percent target. inflation pressure is more likely to come from a round of retaliatory tariffs if trump’s protectionist agenda becomes a global reality. even though pay growth is forecast to average 3.0 percent this year, up from 2.8 percent in december’s poll, the fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, the core pce price index, will probably average 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018, unchanged from the last poll. fed policymakers recently warned that with the economy close to full employment, an expansive fiscal policy could lead to faster rate hikes than currently priced in, pushing the u.s. dollar higher. “if the unemployment rate falls some more, it is going to add to upward pressure on wages and inflation and reinforce the case for fed tightening,” o’sullivan said. the wider poll of over 100 economists, including 17 large banks that transact directly with the fed, showed rates would remain unchanged at 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent until the second quarter, when a 25 basis point hike is likely. a follow up increase is expected in the fourth quarter, taking the fed funds rate to a range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent. fourteen economists, however, forecast a hike by march.

" chile s presidential hopefuls wrapped up campaigning on thursday in a race that has pitted billionaire sebastian pinera s promise for change against center left candidate alejandro guillier s defense of a recent raft of progressive reforms. with their six rivals trailing far behind, pinera and guillier are widely expected to place first and second, respectively, in sunday s election, allowing them to move on to an eventual dec. 17 run off. pinera, a 67 year old former president, has portrayed himself as the best bet for reviving growth that has slowed in recent years in the world s no.1 copper producer. he has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate and scale back outgoing president michelle bachelet s tax, labor and education reforms that guillier has vowed to deepen. bachelet cannot run for office again because of term limits.  chileans face an important decision. they re going to have to choose between change or continuity,  pinera told journalists on thursday on the last day for campaigning before the election. guillier, a bearded former journalist turned senator, has tapped concerns that pinera would mark a setback for gains made in bachelet s government for students, women and workers   from lowered university fees to laws that have empowered unions.  this is an election to define the two chiles,  guillier said.  support for education, health care and rights, or a return to the market.  neither candidate marks a sharp departure from the historically moderate leaders that have governed chile since the country s transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990. but if pinera wins as expected, this year s election would mark another rightward shift in south america following the rise of conservative leaders in peru, argentina and brazil. pinera s and guillier s rivals passed out leaflets and chatted up voters in a final bid to shore up support, or at least help their parties win seats in the next congress. analyst group tresquintos said leftist candidate beatriz sanchez, a distant third in opinion polls, has zero chance of catching up to guillier. the probability of pinera securing at least 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff election was only slightly better at 0.001 percent, it added in an email. still, riding high with more than double guillier s support in recent polls, pinera urged chileans to  make it short  and vote for him on sunday to give him an outright win.

" u.s. republican presidential front runner donald trump said on monday he was “not 100 percent” certain he would participate in a debate this week co hosted by fox news channel (foxa.o) because he did not think moderator megyn kelly could treat him fairly. trump told cnn he would probably participate, but added: “i’m not 100 percent; i’ll see. if i think i’m going to be treated unfairly, i’ll do something else. but i don’t think she can treat me fairly, actually, i think she’s very biased. but that doesn’t mean i don’t do the debate.”     trump added he had won every debate so far. “so i want to do the debates, they’re good for me, but i don’t think she can treat me fairly and i’m not a big fan of hers. maybe i know too much about her.” thursday’s debate, also co hosted by google (googl.o), is the last one before the feb. 1 iowa caucuses, the first contest in the nomination race for the nov. 8 presidential election. later on monday, fox news responded to trump’s remarks in an emailed statement it attributed to a network spokesperson. “sooner or later donald trump, even if he’s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn’t get to pick the journalists   we’re very surprised he’s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by megyn kelly.” following a debate hosted by fox news last august, the real estate billionaire accused the network and kelly of asking him tougher questions than those asked of the other candidates. kelly responded that probing questions were part of her job. trump also drew criticism at the time for comments that many people interpreted as suggesting that kelly was affected by hormones during the debate. trump’s blunt speaking style has boosted ratings for the republican presidential debates. the august debate on fox news drew 24 million viewers, a record for a presidential primary debate and the highest non sports telecast in cable tv history.

" a conservative nonprofit group that lobbies republicans to support clean energy policy will spend more than $1 million over the next few weeks to back 10 members of congress running in the nov. 8 elections, hoping to attract key swing voters such as millennials.   citizens for responsible energy solutions (cres) is backing republican house and senate candidates who favor clean energy, even as republican presidential nominee donald trump mocks wind energy and calls climate change a hoax. embracing a clean energy agenda can help republicans win in close races by attracting key voters like millennials and women, and help broaden the republican base, james dozier, cres executive director, told reuters. “the way i look at it is regardless of who is in the oval office, we need clean energy champions on the hill,” said dozier, who added that republicans have ceded the issue to democrats. “this is a ripe opportunity to reframe republicans’ engagement in energy debate,” said dozier. “we see this as an issue the party can use to grow the tent with the next generation of voters, with female voters and hispanics and african americans.” cres kicked off its fall spending campaign last week with more than $200,000 in radio ad buys for alaska senator lisa murkowski and north carolina senator richard burr, who faces a close re election race against challenger deborah ross.  the group will spend an additional $900,000 in support of other republican candidates, including new hampshire senator kelly ayotte, who is neck in neck with democratic governor maggie hassan in her re election bid, and representative joe heck, who is running in the hotly contested race for the open nevada senate seat against democrat catherine cortez masto. on the house side, cres will spend money for ads and voter turnout efforts for representatives from illinois, virginia, florida and new york. cres is not alone in backing republicans who can help the party embrace clean energy policy and accept the science behind climate change. jay faison, a north carolina based businessman, launched the $2 million clear path action fund to launch digital media campaigns for candidates, including ayotte, who support clean energy in key swing states. but these republican efforts are dwarfed by spending from environmental pacs that are spending record amounts to back democrats. the league of conservation voters said it will spend a record $40 million this election cycle. other groups, including green activist billionaire tom steyer’s nextgen and the natural resources defense council action fund, have also announced tens of millions of dollars more in spending.

" president donald trump’s son in law, jared kushner, voiced optimism about the long term u.s. alliance with iraq’s military and its campaign to retake mosul from islamic state on tuesday, as he visited a base about 10 miles (16 km) from the city. kushner was on the last day of a two day trip to iraq as the guest of marine general joseph dunford, chairman of the u.s. military’s joint chiefs of staff. the visit to the hammam al alil base included an operational briefing from iraqi and u.s. commanders. the trip has demonstrated the far reaching portfolio of kushner, 36, who is part of trump’s innermost circle and who has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a middle east peace deal. his views on iraq could shape trump’s own opinions. it comes as trump is examining ways to accelerate a u.s. led coalition campaign that u.s. and iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting islamic state militants in iraq and syria. mosul is by far the biggest city to have been held by islamic state, and winning it back would largely destroy the iraqi part of the group’s “caliphate,” proclaimed from a mosul mosque in 2014.  there are mounting concerns about civilian casualties in the final phases of the assault and questions about how quickly mosul can be rebuilt, repopulated and governed in a way that avoids alienating its sunni majority population. the mosul battle, the biggest in iraq since the u.s. led invasion in 2003, has been under way since october, with 100,000 iraqi troops, kurdish fighters and shi’ite militiamen seeking to drive out the militants with the support of u.s. led air strikes. although trump campaigned on defeating the hardline sunni militant group, he has not announced any major changes to war strategy and it is unclear how kushner’s experience in iraq might shape his advice to the president.  speaking after lengthy battlefield reports from iraq’s military, kushner sounded upbeat about the campaign and said the partnership between u.s. and iraqi troops was “very impressive.” he expressed hope the partnership would be enduring, signaling white house interest in longer term u.s. military assistance.  “i hope the victory that you have in mosul in the near future will not just be a victory for the american and iraqi troops but it will be a victory for the world,” kushner said. on tuesday, islamic state issued its first official remarks referring to trump since he assumed the u.s. presidency in january, describing him as an “idiot.” “you (the u.s.) are bankrupt and the signs of your demise are evident to every eye,” spokesman abi al hassan al muhajer said in a recording released on the messaging network telegram. “there is no more evidence than (that) you being run by an idiot who does not know what syria or iraq or islam is.”  even after mosul and other pockets of territory are recaptured, u.s. officials expect islamic state to go underground and fight on as a more traditional insurgency.  kushner’s trip was his first to iraq and the visit to hammam al alil, where u.s. advisers and artillery are positioned to assist the battle in mosul, was also the closest dunford has gotten to mosul since the campaign began. they stopped briefly at qayyara west airfield, another key hub in the war, where u.s. forces manning high mobility artillery rocket systems fired twice at islamic state targets in mosul the night before.  iraqi security forces are engaged in fierce, house to house fighting in mosul. nearly 290,000 people have fled the city to escape the fighting, according to the united nations, and it has had a heavy toll on civilians trapped in the city. the advance has been slowed since march 17, when scores of people sheltering from air strikes were killed in a blast. the united states has acknowledged it may have had some kind of role in the incident but also said islamic state may be to blame. a u.s. investigation is ongoing.  dunford said baghdad was looking at ways to better safeguard civilians, given tactics by islamic state that has raised the risks   including the use of civilians as human shields. “the iraqis are looking to make some adaptations,” he told reporters after the talks, which included meetings on monday with iraqi prime minister haider al abadi in baghdad.

" a saudi official has visited northern syria with a u.s. envoy to discuss reconstruction of raqqa, which kurdish and arab militias backed by a u.s. led coalition, captured from islamic state on tuesday, an adviser to the militias said.  saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan visited the area with brett mcgurk, the u.s. special envoy to the coalition against islamic state, and met the raqqa civil council said amed sido, an adviser to the syrian democratic forces (sdf) alliance.  the saudi okaz newspaper also reported on thursday that sabhan had visited northern syria and that riyadh and washington had discussed the reconstruction of raqqa.  saudi arabia is a member of the u.s. led international coalition against islamic state, set up in 2014, but no senior officials from riyadh are known to have visited areas held by coalition allies in syria. saudi arabia s foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment.  the sdf s four month battle against islamic state in raqqa, aided by coalition air strikes, left much of the city in ruins and forced much of its population to flee to camps nearby. international charity mercy corps said on thursday that most of the city was uninhabitable.  the sdf and its allies set up the raqqa civil council to run the city after the fighting was over.  the international coalition s 73 members also include european countries, other arab countries and turkey. its work includes supporting stabilization and restoration of public services to areas taken from islamic state militants. the saudi officials who visited raqqa to check the area were there to listen to discussions rather than take part, sido said, adding that they met a reconstruction committee set up by the council.  they promised that they would contribute in construction in raqqa in the future,  sido said. sido is also an sdf coordinator with the coalition.  the main priority for the city s reconstruction now is clearing landmines and bodies, and working on water and electricity projects, sido said. while no concrete plans were set in motion, sido continued,  we consider it a first visit, a first step, that could be the beginning of future relations .

" once u.s. president donald trump returns from his overseas trip, the white house plans to launch its most aggressive effort yet to push back against allegations involving russia and his presidential campaign, tackling head on a scandal that has threatened to consume his young presidency. trump’s advisers are planning to establish a “war room” to combat mounting questions about communication between russia and his presidential campaign before and after november’s presidential election, while bringing new aides into the white house, administration officials and persons close to trump told reuters. the strategic shake up comes as republicans in washington increasingly have fretted that the probe, continued chaos in the west wing and trump’s steady slide in opinion polls will derail the president’s drive to reform healthcare, cut taxes and rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. upon trump’s return, the administration will add experienced political professionals, including trump’s former campaign manager, and possibly more lawyers to handle the russia probe, which has gained new urgency since the justice department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation, the sources said. beyond pushing back at suggestions that moscow is unduly influencing trump’s administration, the messaging effort will also focus on advancing trump’s stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of trump’s campaign. a person in regular touch with the white house said it needed a different structure to focus on the “new reality” that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities, leaks that have increased in frequency since trump fired former federal bureau of investigation director james comey on may 9. “since the firing of comey, that really exposed the fact that the white house in its current structure ... is not prepared for really a one front war, let alone a two front war,” the person said. “they need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focused” while “also truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks.” the white house declined to comment on plans for a “war room” but said trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the president’s trip to saudi arabia, israel, and europe. a white house official confirmed plans to hold more rallies. trump returns to washington on saturday from his first trip abroad as president. “the president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the white house looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to d.c.,” said white house spokeswoman sarah sanders. jared kushner, a senior adviser to trump, will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation, as will steve bannon, another top adviser who specializes in managing trump’s populist appeal and shaping his political image, the sources said. bannon and trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus, have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week, they added. on thursday, nbc news and the washington post reported that kushner, who held several meetings with russian officials following the election, is a focus of the probe, making him the first current white house official to be caught up in it, although kushner, who is trump’s son in law, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. corey lewandowski, trump’s former campaign manager, is also expected to be part of the effort. lewandowski, who has been seen in the white house recently, could join the administration as early as next week, a source close to him said. lewandowski was fired by trump in june 2016 over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against democrat hillary clinton, but has remained a trusted adviser to trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs. this month, the justice department named robert mueller, a former fbi director, as an independent special counsel in the probe. trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasn’t done a more effective job at making the case that he isn’t implicated in the russia probe and highlighting his administration’s successes, sources close to the president said. the white house declined to comment on the president’s frustrations. another republican close to the white house said the new team is taking a page out of former president bill clinton’s playbook. when clinton faced impeachment in the late 1990s, he assembled a crisis management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with monica lewinsky while allowing the rest of the white house to deal with day to day policy matters.  “the goal of the white house is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel,” the republican said. christopher ruddy, chief executive of newsmax media and a trump friend, said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the white house to focus on issues that pump up his base voters. “from my perspective, i think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best, which is talking about his agenda: jobs, trade and security,” ruddy said.  trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in cedar rapids, iowa. the white house said other similar events are in the planning stages. republicans in congress are aching for trump to leave the distraction of the russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration.  “what we really want to be able to do is tend to our business,” mike rounds, a republican senator from south dakota, told reuters. “we’ve got a healthcare bill we’re working on. we’ve got tax reform that we think is important.” some of trump’s donors, too, say they are concerned. stanley hubbard, a billionaire radio mogul from minnesota, said he worries that the white house continues to be distracted by the russia scandal, but laid some of the blame on trump himself.  “he talks when he shouldn’t,” he said. former u.s. house speaker john boehner said this week that trump’s time in office has been a “complete disaster” aside from foreign affairs. boehner, a fellow republican, told an energy conference he supported efforts to “get to the bottom” of any potential interactions between trump associates and the russian government but described any calls to impeach trump as the purview of “the crazy left wing democratic colleagues of mine.” ",0

" republican lawmakers, operatives and donors grappled with whether to support donald trump, who effectively clinched his party’s presidential nomination this week after his two remaining rivals, ted cruz and john kasich, dropped out of the white house race. as trump sought to rally the fractured party behind him, many prominent republicans got behind the reality tv star and real estate developer, while some weighed their options. still others said they might vote in the nov. 8 general election for hillary clinton, the likely democratic nominee.  bill achtmeyer, the boston based founder of consulting firm parthenon group, was among those considering a possible vote for clinton, a former secretary of state and former first lady.   “if she is able to move to the center and think as creatively and thoughtfully as her husband (bill clinton) did ... boy, i would have a very hard time, based on what i know today, not voting for hillary versus what trump is espousing,” said achtmeyer, who has donated $200,000 to republicans over the last decade. another republican donor, david beightol, a washington lobbyist who raised money this year for the presidential bid of former florida governor jeb bush, said he was leaning toward voting for trump because he could not support clinton. “i’m not there yet, but i don’t have a lot of choice,” beightol said.  in most u.s. elections cycles, party insiders quickly coalesce around candidates once they have effectively sewn up the nomination. but trump’s bombastic rhetoric, unorthodox campaign and his lack of experience in government have left the party divided. the new york billionaire has vowed to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the mexican border. he has also said he would temporarily bar muslims from entering the country as a way to combat terrorism. republican former presidents george h.w. bush and george w. bush do not plan to endorse anyone in the white house race this year, their spokesmen told reuters. the party’s presidential nominee in 2012, mitt romney, will not attend the republican national convention in july, an aide said. the former massachusetts governor delivered a blistering attack on trump in march. the party’s 2008 nominee, u.s. senator john mccain of arizona, has said he would support the eventual nominee, “who is now presumptively donald trump,” said mccain’s senate campaign spokeswoman, lorna romero.  but mccain told supporters in arizona last month that having trump at the top of the republican ticket make his re election harder, according a recording obtained by politico. the state has a large hispanic population. on wednesday, fresh off the win in indiana’s primary that drove both his rivals out of the race, trump pledged to unify the party and said he was getting calls from people who had criticized him in the past but who now wanted to back him.supporters of trump, who has never held elective office,  said he could ease concerns about his lack of experience by choosing a well known running mate. representatives scott desjarlais of tennessee and chris collins of new york both suggested former u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice.  rice did not respond to a request for comment. trump told cnbc on thursday there was a 40 percent chance his vice presidential pick would be a former republican presidential rival. backers said trump could mend ties with allies of cruz, who had been his strongest challenger and had trumpeted himself as a true conservative, by meeting with lawmakers in person after a heated campaign in which trump dubbed the u.s. senator from texas “lyin’ ted.” cruz’s supporters on capitol hill have ties to conservative activists and the tea party, groups that could help trump raise money and turn out voters. desjarlais said meeting trump in person would improve their impressions of him. representative raul labrador, a cruz backer and conservative leader from idaho, told a radio station that he saw trump as favoring the political “establishment” even though he has run as an outsider. but he said trump would likely appoint a conservative to the u.s. supreme court, a priority for many on the political right. “with clinton, there is no chance,” labrador said. “in my opinion, there’s just no choice between the two.” ",0
" criticism of europe by u.s. president elect donald trump only serves to reinforce european solidarity, french finance minister michel sapin said on tuesday. trump said german chancellor angela merkel had made a “catastrophic mistake” with her open door policy on migration, according to an interview published on sunday by german newspaper bild.  “the more he (trump) makes this sort of statement, the more europeans close ranks,” sapin told reporters, adding that such  criticism was unacceptable. “the attack on the chancellor is not an argument we can accept as frenchmen or as europeans.” asked whether europe would have to react if the united states decided to slap a 35 percent tax on imports, sapin said: “we will all have time to see whether there’s a difference between the content of a tweet and the laws that will be passed.” trump was quoted as telling bild he would impose a 35 percent levy on german made cars imported to the u.s. market, a plan that drew sharp rebukes from berlin and hit automakers’ shares. “i would tell bmw that if you are building a factory in mexico and plan to sell cars to the usa, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that,” trump said in remarks translated into german.

" republican senator rand paul, a fiscal hawk who has sometimes opposed his party’s spending plans, said on monday he planned to vote for the u.s. senate tax bill and urged his colleagues to do the same. paul, writing in a fox news online opinion piece, said that while the bill was not perfect and he would “prefer a larger cut,” he planned to support the measure because it achieved some of his goals, and he could push for more changes next year. “this tax bill is a true test for my colleagues,” wrote paul, who represents kentucky. “i’m not getting everything i want — far from it. but i’ve been immersed in this process. i’ve fought for and received major changes for the better — and i plan to vote for this bill as it stands right now.”  president donald trump, also a republican, had set a goal of signing a sweeping tax overhaul into law before the end of 2017. about a half dozen lawmakers have voiced concerns about provisions including a nearly $1.5 trillion addition to the federal deficit, the treatment of small businesses and the potential impact on health insurances costs for people with medical conditions.  senate republicans hope to pass their bill as early as thursday. with only a 52 48 majority in the 100 seat senate, and democrats unlikely to vote for the measure, they can lose support from no more than two members of their own ranks.   with the clock ticking, trump was set to meet top senate republican tax writers at the white house as the administration considered policy tweaks to make the bill more palatable to potential republican holdouts.

" the syrian opposition applauded a u.s. cruise missile attack on an airbase near homs on friday but said it must not be a one off and was not enough on its own to stop government warplanes from hitting rebel held areas. the syrian opposition has long criticized the united states for failing to protect rebel held areas from government air strikes, demanding the creation of a no fly zone or the provision of anti aircraft weapons to rebel groups. u.s. president donald trump’s decision to launch missiles at the airbase, from which he said a deadly chemical weapons attack had been launched, marked a dramatic departure from the more cautious approach of his predecessor barack obama. it was welcomed by opposition officials, but they called for more.  “one airbase is not enough. there are 26 airbases that target civilians,” tweeted mohammad alloush, a senior rebel official. george sabra, a prominent opposition politician, told al hadath tv: “the truth is that militarily, if it is limited to this strike, then it has no meaning.” the free syrian army, a loose alliance of rebel groups that includes factions that have received military support from the united states, called the u.s. strike the “correct starting point” for finding a “just political solution” to the war “we view that the responsibility of the united states is still great, and does not stop with this operation,” it added in a statement, warning that the damascus government and its allies could commit “acts of revenge” against civilians. american officials described the attack   the first direct u.s. assault on the government of president bashar al assad in six years of civil war   as a one off that would not lead to wider escalation. syrian officials and their allies also said they did not expect the attack to lead to an expansion of the conflict. the strikes targeted the base at shayrat, 40 km (25 miles) southeast of homs city, from which washington and syrian opposition groups say syrian warplanes launched a chemical weapons attack on the town of khan sheikhoun this week. the syrian government has strongly denied responsibility and says it does not use chemical weapons. the homs governor said on friday the base was being used to provide air support for operations against islamic state east of palmyra. hassan haj ali, commander of the free idlib army rebel group, which fights under the fsa umbrella, told reuters the strikes came at a “very important phase” and showed syrians that “there is still humanity in this world”. he said he did not expect further such u.s. attacks, however. nasr al hariri, chief negotiator of the high negotiations committee (hnc), said on twitter that the strikes “should they continue, would kick off a correct start in combating terrorism”.   the saudi based hnc, the main opposition body which includes political and armed groups, has participated in u.n. sponsored peace talks in geneva. “we hope for the continuation of the strikes in order to prevent the regime from using its planes to launch any new air raids or going back to using internationally banned weapons,” said ahmad ramadan, head of the media office of the syrian national coalition political opposition group.  “the airbase targeted by the u.s. strike was used to kill syrians,” ramadan said. the american attack “sends a clear message to the regime and its backers” that they can no longer avoid repercussions, he added.

" japan s prime minister shinzo abe will lay the foundation stone for india s first bullet train in prime minister narendra modi s home state this week, in a tightening of ties just days after new delhi ended a dangerous military confrontation with china. the move by abe, who starts a two day visit to india on wednesday, highlights an early lead for japan in a sector where the chinese have also been trying to secure a foothold, but without much success. modi has made the 500 km  (311 mile ) long high speed rail link between the financial hub of mumbai and the industrial city of ahmedabad in western gujarat a centerpiece of his efforts to showcase india s ability to build cutting edge infrastructure. the leaders will launch the start of work on the line on thursday, india s railways ministry said in a statement.  this technology will revolutionize and transform the transport sector,  said railways minister piyush goyal, welcoming the prospects for growth brought by japan s high speed  shinkansen  technology. in tokyo, a japanese foreign ministry official told reporters,  we would like to support  make in india  as much as possible,  referring to modi s signature policy to lure investors in manufacturing.  and for that, we want to do what s beyond the mumbai ahmedabad line and achieve economies of scale.   india would make  all out efforts  to complete the line by august 2022, more than a year earlier than planned, the government said this week. japan is providing 81 percent of the funding for the 1.08 trillion rupee ($16.9 billion) project, through a 50 year loan at 0.1 percent annual interest.  ties between india and japan have blossomed as modi and abe increasingly see eye to eye in countering growing chinese assertiveness across asia. japanese investment into india has surged in areas ranging from automotives to infrastructure in the remote northeast, making tokyo its third largest foreign direct investor.   india and japan are also trying to move forward on a plan for new delhi to buy japanese amphibious aircraft   shinmaywa industries  us 2   in what would be one of tokyo s first arms transfers since ending a self imposed embargo.  tokyo hopes that by gaining a head start on rival exporters of rail technology such as china and germany, its companies will be able to dominate business in one of the most promising markets for high speed rail equipment. in 2015, china won a contract to assess the feasibility of a high speed link between delhi and mumbai, part of a network of more than 10,000 km (6,214 miles) of track india wants to set up, but little progress has been made. bullet train critics say the funds would be far better spent to modernize india s slow and rickety state controlled rail system, the world s fourth largest.  but a $15 billion safety overhaul has hit delays as a state steel firm proved unable to fill demand for new rail.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency is preparing for hurricane irma s landfall on the u.s. east coast by securing vulnerable toxic waste sites and easing gasoline standards to ensure steady fuel supplies, its chief told reuters on thursday. epa administrator scott pruitt declined to say whether he believed claims by scientists that the second powerful storm to affect the united states in two weeks may have a link to warmer air and water temperatures resulting from climate change.  the most we can do is help people in these areas by monitoring drinking water and respond to real and tangible issues,  he said in a brief telephone interview. hurricane irma is expected to make landfall in florida as early as friday after slamming caribbean islands with 185 mph winds, only days after hurricane harvey triggered record flooding in texas that killed scores of people. the epa said has issued waivers on certain federal requirements for the sale, production and blending of gasoline to avoid supply shortfalls in the aftermath of harvey and as hurricane irma approaches florida. pruitt said he spoke with florida governor rick scott about potentially issuing more waivers on gasoline requirements if the need arises after irma.  epa will grant additional waivers if requested,  he said. he said the agency is also evaluating 80 superfund toxic waste sites from florida to north carolina to identify those at risk of flooding. the epa has yet to finish assessing the impact of harvey on texas superfund sites   heavily contaminated former industrial zones   amid widespread flooding. on saturday, the agency said 13 sites were flooded or damaged, but the full impact on surrounding areas was not immediately clear. pruitt said the agency is also continuing to seek additional information about explosions last week at french chemical company arkema s  flooded plant in crosby, texas, which sickened more than a dozen law enforcement personnel and prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area.

" russia and the united states are still discussing the timing of the first face to face encounter between donald trump and vladimir putin, expected to take place at a g20 summit in germany later this week, a kremlin aide said on monday. since trump was elected u.s. president, russian has been keenly anticipating his first meeting with putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in u.s. russia relations that plunged to post cold war lows under trump’s predecessor, barack obama. but with trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates’ links to moscow, the encounter with putin has become a minefield. too warm a meeting would allow trump’s domestic opponents to accuse him of being a kremlin stooge. kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov told reporters the trump putin meeting would happen on the sidelines of the g20 summit, in hamburg, but it was not yet finalised how it would fit into the summit’s schedule. “we will be looking for certain breaks, windows to hold this, the most important, meeting,” ushakov said. “we have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level ... that’s why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.” asked about the agenda for the meeting, ushakov said: “i’ve heard the americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and syria. it seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.” ushakov said that ties between russia and the united states were at “zero level.” the kremlin aide urged the united states “to save us from the need to retaliate” against washington for expelling russian diplomats and seizing two russian diplomatic compounds on u.s. soil, one in maryland and the other on long island. barack obama ordered the expulsion of the 35 russians in late december last year, seized the compounds, and imposed sanctions on two russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. russian has denied interfering in the u.s. election. putin said at the time he would not retaliate immediately, in the expectation that relations would improve under trump. with no thaw materializing yet, russian officials have said this month that they may now have to take “symmetrical” steps in retaliation.

" florida residents were given six extra days to register to vote in the nov. 8 election by a u.s. judge on wednesday following the disruption triggered by powerful hurricane matthew in the state last week. u.s. district judge mark walker in tallahassee extended the registration deadline to oct. 18 after the florida democratic party sued to seek more time. the original deadline to register had been tuesday, before walker ordered a one day reprieve to allow for a hearing on wednesday. florida democrats had argued that voters were forced to decide between their safety and their right to vote when republican governor rick scott ordered evacuations along a stretch of the state’s atlantic coast as matthew approached.  “no right is more precious than having a voice in our democracy,” walker wrote in a three page court ruling on the lawsuit. florida is a battleground state in the nov. 8 presidential election pitting democrat hillary clinton against republican donald trump, with opinion polls showing a close race there. it is the largest of the hotly contested states whose populations can swing either to republicans or democrats and thus play a decisive role. the powerful hurricane, which killed around 1,000 people in haiti as it churned through the caribbean, is blamed for at least 30 deaths in florida, georgia, south carolina and north carolina. north carolina now faces flooding from swollen rivers.   in its complaint, the florida democratic party alleged that the state’s refusal to extend the voter registration deadline would have a “decidedly partisan effect,” noting that populations that lean democratic, including minorities and younger voters, register in greater numbers just before the deadline.  it also noted that areas affected by matthew have substantial populations of black and latino voters who would be disproportionately likely to register to vote at the last minute. in past presidential years, up to 20 percent of all new registrations in florida were filed during the week before the deadline, according to the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law, which helped bring the lawsuit. “while we wish it had not taken a lawsuit to get the scott administration to do the right thing, today’s ruling is a major victory for all floridians and for the democratic process in the sunshine state,” the state democratic party said in a statement. the judge earlier ruled that florida law did not give scott authority to extend voter registration and that he was not a proper party to the case. florida secretary of state ken detzner, a scott appointee also named in the lawsuit, was empowered to do so, walker noted. “the state will follow the court’s decision and discuss with the legislature possible amendments to current law,” scott’s office said in a statement earlier in the week.  south carolina extended its registration deadline due to matthew from oct. 7 to oct. 11, while georgia declined to do so.  north carolina will not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, which ends on friday, although allowances will be made for delayed mail delivery of registration forms, state officials said on wednesday. however, those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from oct. 20 through nov. 5.

" in pennsylvania state senator daylin leach’s bid to win a seat vital to the democratic party’s chances in 2018 elections of taking control of the u.s. congress, his opponents may not be his biggest obstacle. leach is running in one of the country’s most gerrymandered congressional districts, one with such a twisting, winding shape that it has earned the derisive nickname “goofy kicking donald duck.” the 7th congressional district has become a national poster child for critics of gerrymandering, the process by which one party draws district boundaries to ensure an advantage among voters. democrats say the lines have helped republicans like u.s. representative patrick meehan, the four term incumbent leach seeks to unseat, to stay in office. that could soon change, however. on monday in state court in harrisburg, one of three lawsuits challenging those boundaries heads to trial. the outcome could shift several battleground districts in pennsylvania and in turn boost the democrats in the u.s. house of representatives, where they last held the majority from january 2007 to january 2011. the 7th district is so precisely engineered that at one point it narrows to the width of a single seafood restaurant, snaking past two other congressional districts so it can link two far flung republican leaning areas. “three congressional districts all converge on this spot,” leach said from the parking lot at creed’s seafood and steaks last week, as cars whizzed overhead on the pennsylvania turnpike. “this is the sixth; over there is the seventh; and down that road is the 13th,” he said, pointing in several directions. “this is what gerrymandering looks like on the ground.” leach has at least four opponents to defeat in the democratic primary before he would run against meehan. a spokesman for the republican did not respond to requests for comment on the trial over gerrymandering. critics of gerrymandering say it helps explain why pennsylvania has sent 13 republicans and only five democrats to the u.s. house since the 2011 redistricting, despite being a closely divided swing state. republican legislators counter that the lines were drawn in accordance with the law and that their candidates have prevailed in elections thanks to superior policy ideas. the democrats have targeted six republican held districts in the state as part of their quest to pick up the 24 house seats they need to overturn the republicans, who also have a senate majority and president donald trump in the white house.  democrats need to win the nationwide popular vote by at least 10 points in 2018 to do so, in part because of gerrymandered lines, according to michael li, a redistricting expert and lawyer at new york university’s brennan center for justice. “pennsylvania is probably the most aggressive of the gerrymanders,” he said. “you look at some of the maps in the philadelphia suburbs, and it looks like a 4 year old just slapped paint around.” the non partisan league of women voters of pennsylvania sued the state in june, arguing the maps violate the state constitution by depriving residents of a meaningful vote. the litigation is part of a growing set of legal challenges to partisan redistricting, including a u.s. supreme court case out of wisconsin that could for the first time establish a constitutional standard to measure the legality of such map making. the high court is scheduled to decide that case by june 2018, five months before the midterm elections. “the politicians are not supposed to pick their voters; the voters are supposed to elect their leaders,” said mimi mckenzie, an attorney with the public interest law center who represents the league of women voters and other pennsylvania voters. spokesmen for the state’s republican legislative leaders, defendants in the case, said the redistricting followed the process laid out in the state constitution and that the u.s. supreme court has said political considerations can play a role. “they just can’t understand how republicans can actually beat their candidates,” stephen miskin, a spokesman for pennsylvania house speaker mike turzai, said of the legal challengers. in addition to the state case, two pending federal lawsuits also challenge the district lines as unconstitutional. legal observers consider the state lawsuit the most likely to succeed in time for the voting next november. the democratic majority state supreme court has ordered the presiding judge to render his decision by dec. 31. the high court will then determine whether to accept his ruling or issue its own conclusions. the state lawsuit asserts the redistricting included numerous examples of blatantly partisan lines. democrat dominated reading, one of the most economically depressed cities in the state, was carved out of the 6th district and placed into the reliably democratic 13th, a move the plaintiffs said was intended to render the city’s votes meaningless. montgomery county, where state senator leach lives, has approximately 820,000 residents, slightly more than the 711,000 needed for a single congressional district, but has been sliced into five separate districts. leach said he would make gerrymandering a campaign issue. “it’s theft of democracy,” leach said. “this is horribly destructive.” the story was refiled to correct paragraph 4 to say that democrats held majority in u.s. house of representatives from 2007 to 2011, not 2009 to 2011 ",0

" the parents and lawyers of a philippine high school student shot dead last week filed a murder complaint on friday against three  anti narcotics policemen amid rare public outrage about the country s war on drugs.  the death of 17 year old kian loyd delos santos on aug. 16 in a rundown area of manila has drawn huge domestic attention to allegations by activists that police have been systematically executing suspected users and dealers, a charge the authorities deny.  the head of the public attorney s office (pao) and the parents of the slain youth submitted the complaint against the three policemen at the justice department, calling for them to be charged with murder and breaches of a law on torture. the pao, a government agency, provides indigent litigants free legal assistance. delos santos was found dead in an alley with a gun in his left hand. police said they killed him in self defense, but his family said he had no weapon, was right handed and had no involvement in drugs. security cameras showed the officers aggressively escorting a man matching delos santos  description in the direction of the spot where he was killed. the three policemen admit they were the people shown in the video, but that they were escorting another suspect, not delos santos. pao and police pathologists who did separate autopsies told a senate hearing that delos santos was shot from above, from close range.   it was cold blooded murder, he was shot while kneeling down,  pao chief persida acosta told news channel anc.  we are here for truth and justice so we have to file this immediately.  the complaint, if accepted, would follow at least two cases filed last year against police over president rodrigo duterte s war on drugs, which has killed thousands of filipinos, outraged human rights groups and alarmed western governments. most filipinos however support the campaign, according to opinion polls, and domestic opposition has been muted.  several police commanders relieved of their duty over the student s killing told a senate inquiry on thursday that delos santos was not the target of their operation, and his links to drug were known to them only the day after his death. officers said they learned of his suspected links to drugs from another drug suspect, a cellphone and chatter circulating on social media. delos santos was among more than 90 people killed last week in three nights of intensified raids dubbed  one time, big time , which had duterte s steadfast support. the term refers to a coordinated police drive to stamp out crime in a particular district. the teen s killing puts focus on duterte s repeated promises to police administering the crackdown that he would insulate them from any legal consequences. critics say his rhetoric is tantamount to giving police a license to kill. duterte took a softer tone on wednesday, telling police to arrest suspects and kill only if their lives were in danger, adding that he would not protect those who killed unarmed people.

" washington turned into a virtual fortress on thursday ahead of donald trump’s presidential inauguration, while thousands of people took to the streets of new york and washington to express their displeasure with his coming administration. some 900,000 people, both trump backers and opponents, are expected to flood washington for friday’s inauguration ceremony, according to organizers’ estimates. events include the swearing in ceremony on the steps of the u.s. capitol and a parade to the white house along streets thronged with spectators. the number of planned protests and rallies this year is far above what has been typical at recent presidential inaugurations, with some 30 permits granted in washington for anti trump rallies and sympathy protests planned in cities from boston to los angeles, and outside the u.s. in cities including london and sydney.  the night before the inauguration, thousands of people turned out in new york for a rally at the trump international hotel and tower, and then marched a few blocks from the trump tower where the businessman lives. the rally featured a lineup of politicians, activists and celebrities including mayor bill de blasio and actor alec baldwin, who trotted out the trump parody he performs on “saturday night live.” “donald trump may control washington, but we control our destiny as americans,” de blasio said. “we don’t fear the future. we think the future is bright, if the people’s voices are heard.” in washington, a group made up of hundreds of protesters clashed with police clad in riot gear who used pepper spray against some of the crowd on thursday night, according to footage on social media.  the confrontation occurred outside the national press club building, where inside a so called “deploraball” event was being held in support of trump, the footage showed. u.s. department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson said police aimed to keep groups separate, using tactics similar to those employed during last year’s political conventions. “the concern is some of these groups are pro trump, some of them are con trump, and they may not play well together in the same space,” johnson said on msnbc. trump opponents have been angered by his comments during the campaign about women, illegal immigrants and muslims and his pledges to scrap the obamacare health reform and build a wall on the mexican border. the republican’s supporters admire his experience in business, including as a real estate developer and reality television star, and view him as an outsider who will take a fresh approach to politics. bikers for trump, a group that designated itself as security backup during last summer’s republican national convention in cleveland, is ready to step in if protesters block access to the inauguration, said dennis egbert, one of the group’s organizers. “we’re going to be backing up law enforcement. we’re on the same page,” egbert, 63, a retired electrician from harrisburg, pennsylvania. about 28,000 security personnel, miles of fencing, roadblocks, street barricades and dump trucks laden with sand are part of the security cordon around 3 square miles (8 square km) of central washington. a protest group known as disrupt j20 has vowed to stage demonstrations at each of 12 security checkpoints and block access to the festivities on the grassy national mall. police and security officials have pledged repeatedly to guarantee protesters’ constitutional rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. aaron hyman, fellow at the national gallery of art, said he could feel tension in the streets ahead of trump’s swearing in and the heightened security was part of it. “people are watching each other like, ‘you must be a trump supporter,’ and ‘you must be one of those liberals’,” said hyman, 32, who supported democrat hillary clinton in the november election. friday’s crowds are expected to fall well short of the 2 million people who attended obama’s first inauguration in 2009, and be in line with the 1 million who were at his second in 2013. forecast rain may also dampen the turnout, though security officials lifted an earlier ban on umbrellas, saying small umbrellas would be permitted.

taya kyle speaks to obama regarding the illogical strategy of his new gun control measures: ,1
" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions, who oversees the federal bureau of investigation, on friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation’s leading law enforcement agency, which has been under attack by president donald trump and other republicans. trump said earlier this month that the fbi’s reputation was in “tatters” after news came to light that an fbi agent on a team investigating links between russia and trump’s election campaign had exchanged anti trump text messages with an fbi lawyer.     sessions on friday defended the bureau, which is part of the department of justice that he leads, but it was not an enthusiastic endorsement. “i don’t share the view that the fbi is not functioning at a high level all over the country,” he told a news conference. sessions’ comments came at a time when former fbi director robert mueller is leading an investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. a sampling of texts between agent peter strzok and fbi lawyer lisa page was released to congress and the media earlier this week. the two referred to trump as an “idiot,” but also took aim at other politicians, including democrat hillary clinton, who lost to trump in the 2016 election, and independent bernie sanders, who had sought the democratic nomination for president. strzok was transferred off mueller’s team, but the texts provided fresh fodder for some republicans who have fiercely criticized mueller in a move that democrats say is an effort to discredit his russia investigation. russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election, and trump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with russia.         sessions is the latest senior official to defend the fbi. his comments were much milder than those of fbi director christopher wray and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in recent testimony to congress. sessions said trump does support the fbi and noted that trump spoke earlier on friday to a class of domestic and international law enforcement managers graduating from an fbi training program in quantico, virginia. however, the audience did not consist of fbi agents, and trump’s speech was to local and state police officers. sessions also ducked a question about whether he will appoint a second special counsel to investigate some of the bias allegations against mueller’s team, as some republicans have demanded.

" a presidential election run off in liberia scheduled for tuesday will be delayed by a supreme court fraud investigation, the national elections commission (nec) said on friday. former soccer star george weah and vice president joseph boakai are competing to succeed president ellen johnson sirleaf, a nobel peace prize laureate whose election in 2005 helped draw a line under 14 years of civil war. the vote is meant to mark liberia s first democratic transition of power since 1944, but the supreme court this week halted preparations while it examined charges by third place finisher charles brumskine s liberty party that the oct. 10 first round was marred by fraud. following arguments by the liberty party and counter arguments by the nec, chief justice francis korkpor said that the court would give its decision at 10 a.m. (1000 gmt) on monday, one day before the scheduled poll.   the election will definitely be delayed, but we don t know for how long,  nec spokesman henry flomo said.  the fact that the court will not rule until monday is a delay.  boakai s ruling unity party has backed the liberty party s allegations and even accused johnson sirleaf, one of its own members, of interfering in the vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates.  johnson sirleaf denied the meetings were inappropriate. observers from the european union and the carter center said they saw no major problems with the first round vote. addressing the court s five justices, brumskine cited  gross irregularities . in its complaint last week, the liberty party alleged various problems, including the late opening of polls, the absence of queue controllers and fraud by nec officials.   this is not about losing or winning,  brumskine told the court.  it has do to do with putting a system in place.  lawyers for the nec replied that the petitioners did not have any evidence and asked that the court lift its stay so that the commission could organize the second round.  the streets of the capital monrovia remained calm with riot police deployed to protect the supreme court building and the election commission headquarters. weah, who became the first non european to win the european soccer player of the year award in 1995, won the first round of voting with 38.4 percent to boakai s 28.8 percent. brumskine won nearly 10 percent.

" u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton met with coal and steel workers in the appalachian region on monday in an effort to win over blue collar voters in a part of the country with strong support for republican donald trump. the real estate mogul made his own pitch on monday to voters in areas struggling from the loss of industry, telling a crowd in indiana he would create “clean coal” jobs. clinton has increasingly turned her attention beyond the democratic party nomination fight with u.s. senator bernie sanders and is making early moves to try to siphon support from trump ahead of a possible match up in the nov. 8 election. on monday, she met union leaders and some of the 600 workers who were laid off last year when ak steel holding corp announced it would idle a furnace in eastern kentucky. she said jobs losses in manufacturing and the coal industry in the area had been a heavy blow. “talk about a ripple effect. it’s just devastating communities,” clinton told workers around a table at an italian restaurant in the town of ashland.  while the republican presidential candidates focus on tuesday’s primary contest in indiana, clinton launched a trip to appalachia this week that will include events in ohio and west virginia.     she has a large lead over sanders for the democratic nomination. unions typically back democratic candidates, and union leaders have endorsed both clinton and sanders in the 2016 presidential race.  but trump’s pro coal, anti trade message and outsider status has resonated with some blue collar union members frustrated with washington politicians. he and other republicans also accuse president barack obama’s administration of waging a “war on coal” by imposing strict environmental regulations. “i’m a free market guy, but not when you’re getting killed,” trump said at a rally in carmel, indiana. “look at steel, it’s being wiped out. your coal industry is wiped out, and china is taking our coal.”     the new york businessman won the republican nominating contest in kentucky in march, sweeping most of the counties in the economically struggling east of the state. parts of appalachia, a region that spans multiple states across the eastern united states, have struggled with poverty and job losses. west virginia’s unemployment rate of 6.5 percent in march was well above the national rate of 5 percent, according to labor department data. ohio’s unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, while the figure in kentucky was 5.6 percent. it will be an uphill struggle for clinton there if she wins the nomination. she has pledged more than $30 billion to help regions that depend on coal, but her promise was overshadowed when she said in march that the country would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” and her husband, former president bill clinton, campaigned on sunday in west virginia, encountering protests from trump supporters.   west virginia last voted for a democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when bill clinton was running for his second four year term. he is the only democrat who has won kentucky since 1980. trump will take a leap toward winning the republican nomination if he comes out ahead in tuesday’s indiana primary. his success in the race for the white house may well ride on the support of republican evangelicals. top rival ted cruz planned stops to greet voters across the state on monday, running into a group of trump supporters in marion, indiana who berated him. he deployed his wife, heidi, and carly fiorina, the ex candidate who cruz has chosen as his running mate if he gets the republican nomination, to a coffee shop and art gallery in carmel, indiana. cruz, who lags trump in delegates to the republican national convention in july, told reporters on monday he would stay in the race “as long as we have a viable path to victory.” republicans plan to tie clinton to what they say is an anemic economy under president barack obama. republican national committee chairman reince priebus on monday cited data released last week that showed economic growth slipped in the first quarter to its slowest pace in two years. “struggling americans will never get ahead under hillary clinton. they are going to keep getting taken to the cleaners,” priebus said in an opinion piece for realclearpolitics.

here s what mccain said that got rand paul all worked up:,1
" the head of the u.s. senate’s armed services committee, john mccain, has proposed $7.5 billion of new military funding for u.s. forces and their allies in the asia pacific, where tensions have been rising over china’s territorial ambitions. the funds, $1.5 billion a year for five years to 2022, could be used to boost u.s. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and to help allies and partner countries increase their capabilities, an aide to mccain and a u.s. military official said. the funding proposal was contained in a white paper issued by mccain last week entitled “restoring american power.” his committee is expected to discuss it at a budget hearing on tuesday. “senator mccain believes the united states must sustain its enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of the asia pacific region,” a spokesman for mccain, dustin walker, said.  “the asia pacific stability initiative ... would ... make u.s. regional posture more forward learning, flexible, resilient, and formidable,” he said. “these funds would boost operational military construction, increase munitions procurement, enhance capacity building with allies and partners, and expand military exercises and other training activities.” an official in the administration of new u.s. president donald trump, who took office on friday, said he believed mccain’s proposal was “very much in general alignment with the administration’s goals in the region.”  trump has vowed to take a tougher line with china and to build up the u.s. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of “sequestration” legislation. a u.s. military official, who did not want to be identified, said the funds could go to construct new military runways in countries such as australia and the philippines and to make up a shortfall of munitions that the head of the u.s. pacific command, admiral harry harris, complained of last year. “there’s a shortfall in the total number of munitions and also a quality gap,” the official said, adding that more sophisticated missiles were needed in the region to counter china’s “anti access, area denial” strategy.  on monday, the new u.s. administration raised the prospect of worsening tensions with china when it vowed to prevent beijing from taking over territory in international waters in the south china sea, something chinese state media has warned would require washington to “wage war.” ",0
" the united states threatened on tuesday to take further action against the south sudan government if it does not end violence and allow united nations peacekeepers to do their job, but u.n. sanctions are unlikely as russia has warned against such a move. a month after u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley visited south sudan and met with president salva kiir in the capital juba, she told the u.n. security council:  words are no longer sufficient.   the united states is prepared to pursue additional measures against the government   or any party, for that matter   if they do not act to end the violence and ease the suffering in south sudan,  said haley, who was the most senior member of president donald trump s administration to visit south sudan. the trump administration imposed sanctions in september on two senior south sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the civil war and attacks against civilians.  however, any u.s. push for the u.n. security council to take further action against south sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power russia. the council sanctioned several senior south sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015, but a u.s. bid to impose an arms embargo in december 2016 failed.   it is counterproductive to impose targeted sanctions, counterproductive to impose an arms embargo, such measures will not help to break this deadlock and will only further exacerbate the crisis,  russia s deputy u.n. ambassador petr iliichev. south sudan spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from sudan, and a third of the 12 million population has fled their homes. the conflict was sparked by a feud between kiir, a dinka, and his former deputy riek machar, a nuer, who is being held in south africa. a fragile peace deal in south sudan broke down last year and east african bloc igad has been trying to revive it.   we view as unjust the ongoing attempts to place all blame for the persistent unabated violence on juba alone, it has done its role, now the opposition must reciprocate,  iliichev said.  u.n. sanctions monitors reported earlier this month that despite the catastrophic conditions across south sudan, armed forces, groups and militias   particularly those affiliated with kiir and vice president taban deng gai   continued to  actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.

" the united states has called on cambodia to reverse steps that  backtracked on democracy  before a general election next year, a visiting u.s. official said on wednesday. relations between cambodia and the united states have hit their lowest in years after the arrest of a rival of long serving prime minister hun sen, kem sokha, and the dissolution of his opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp).  hun sen accused kem sokha and his party of a u.s. backed anti government plot. the opposition leader and the united states denied that.  we are advising that these steps that have taken place here that have backtracked on democracy could be reversed,  said patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for southeast asia, the most senior u.s. official to visit since the cnrp was dissolved. murphy told reporters in phnom penh that cambodia still had time before the general election in july to  conduct an electoral process that is legitimate . hun sen looks set to extend his 32 year rule easily next year after eliminating the cnrp, which had made big gains in the last general election in 2013. on tuesday, the european union followed a u.s. lead in suspending funding for the election.  kem sokha has been accused of plotting treason with unidentified americans and the cambodian supreme court dissolved his party last month at the government s request. kem sokha said the charges were a political ploy. murphy said allegations of a u.s. backed plot were a fabrication.  we want a good relationship,  he said.  there is a little bit of friction, a little bit of noise in the official bilateral relationship but we remain optimistic.  during his visit, murphy met senior officials but no government ministers. he also met civil society groups. ouch borith, secretary of state at the foreign ministry, who met murphy on tuesday, told reporters their talks had been about improving the relationship.  he defended his government s actions.  what we ve done is in the legal framework to defend cambodia s independence, peace and stability. we didn t do anything illegal,  he said. reaction to the dissolution of the cnrp has been largely muted in cambodia.  rights groups have decried what they say is an increasingly repressive atmosphere in the southeast asian nation, and have condemned the detention of several reporters and closure of some media outlets. hun sen has shrugged off criticism from the west. china, cambodia s largest aid donor, has leant its support to hun sen saying it respects cambodia s right to defend its national security.

" legislation to allow michigan gun owners to carry a concealed handgun without a permit was approved in the state house of representatives on wednesday, in a move that follows the lead of a dozen other states. the package of four bills, which cleared the republican controlled house with support from a handful of democrats, now moves to the senate, also dominated by republicans.  it was not immediately clear whether michigan’s republican governor rick snyder supports the bill. but the measure, if also approved in a senate vote, could automatically become law 14 days after reaching the governor’s desk unless he vetoes it. the legislation would lift a requirement that handgun owners obtain a concealed pistol license with a $100 fee to legally carry the weapon in public.  handgun owners also would be allowed carry a concealed pistol in public without the firearms training that is currently mandated.  advocates framed the issue as upholding a u.s. constitutional right to bear arms. “we all know criminals are not paying fees, taking classes and waiting for approval to come in the mail before they begin carrying guns,” michigan state representative michele hoitenga, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.  the legislation “levels the playing field for honest people,” she said. opponents of the bill criticized it as dangerous. twelve other u.s. states already allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed carry permit, according to the law center to prevent gun violence. most are conservative leaning with republican majority legislatures but vermont, where democrats control the statehouse, is among the 12. “the states that have eliminated the permit requirement are basically making it easier to carry a gun in public than drive a car,” said hannah shearer, a staff attorney with the san francisco based law center to prevent gun violence. legislation introduced in the u.s. congress this year would, if approved and signed by president donald trump, require all states to allow firearm owners to carry their guns under the regulations of their home state, even if visiting elsewhere. for instance, a person allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in north dakota could do so when visiting california or new york state, where permits are required, shearer said.

" four people were killed when a united nations world food programme (wfp) aid convoy was ambushed in northeast nigeria, a wfp spokeswoman said on sunday, in the latest attack in the region as the conflict with boko haram nears its ninth year. attacks on aid workers are relatively rare in the conflict with the islamist insurgency, compared with assaults on the military and civilians in nigeria s northeast. the years of fighting have spawned what the united nations calls one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 8.5 million people in need of life saving assistance.  wfp can confirm that a convoy escorted by the nigerian military including wfp hired trucks was the subject of an attack by armed groups 35 km southwest of ngala in borno state on saturday,  she said in an emailed statement.   four people, including the driver of a wfp hired truck and a driver s assistant, were killed in the incident,  the statement said, adding that  wfp is working with the authorities to determine the whereabouts of the trucks.  the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the driver and assistant were wfp staff, or give details about the other two people killed. a military spokesman declined to comment. last year, the united nations suspended aid deliveries in nigeria s northeastern state of borno, the epicenter of the conflict, after a humanitarian convoy was attacked, leaving two aid workers injured. last week, the nigerian government approved the release of $1 billion from the country s excess oil account to the government to help fight the boko haram insurgency, despite a two year narrative that boko haram has been all but defeated. there are other signs the government and military may be abandoning that narrative. nigeria s long term plan is now to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns   effectively ceding the countryside to boko haram. earlier this month, nigeria replaced the military commander of the campaign against boko haram after half a year in the post. military sources told reuters that came after a series of  embarrassing  attacks by the islamists.

" peru s former president alberto fujimori was rushed from prison to a local hospital by ambulance late on saturday after suffering a severe drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm that put him at risk of dying, fujimori s doctor said. cardiologists recommended that he be removed from prison immediately, alejandro aguinaga said.  it looks complicated,  he told journalists gathered outside the hospital. fujimori, 79, is serving a 25 year sentence for graft and human rights crimes. he is a deeply divisive figure in peru. while many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990 2000 term. the medical emergency will likely heap pressure on center right president pedro pablo kuczynski to free the former  leader, a move that could rewrite political alliances and spark protests in one of latin america s most stable economies. three days earlier, a faction of fujimori s supporters in congress unexpectedly saved kuczynski from a motion that would have forced him from office less than two years into his five year term. the opposition said kuczynski only survived the vote by promising 10 lawmakers that he would free fujimori if they backed him. kuczynski s government denies the allegations. fujimori fled peru for his parent s native japan as his government imploded in a graft scandal at the turn of the century. he was eventually extradited to peru and was convicted for leading death squads that massacred civilians. despite fujimori s downfall, the rightwing populist movement fujimori started in the 1990s remains one of the country s most potent political forces. his two adult children, keiko and kenji, lead rival factions of the rightwing party, popular force, that controls a majority of seats in congress and pushed to oust kuczynski this week. over the past year, kenji has challenged his sister keiko s leadership and he has led calls for his release, which could give him a boost if he is freed. tv images showed kenji, who led the faction that backed kuczynski, riding in the ambulance that drove fujimori to the peruvian japanese centenario clinic for treatment.  if a (presidential) pardon happens now, it s because there was a pact,  congresswoman marisa glave said on twitter.  a pardon can t be decided in an under the table deal.  glave is one of about 10 leftist lawmakers who   despite criticizing kuczynski as a lobbyist   opted not to support the bid to oust him out of fear it would empower popular force. fujimori s well organized foes were key to kuczynski s razor thin victory over keiko in last year s presidential election, and to keeping keiko s followers from ousting him this week. fujimori s supporters dismissed suggestions that his health troubles were a ruse to pave the way for a pardon.  there s no circus,  luisa maria cuculiza, a former ruling party lawmaker during his government, said on local broadcaster rpp. ",0
" the u.s. senate democratic leader, chuck schumer, called on monday for the removal of republican representative devin nunes as chairman of the house of representatives’ intelligence committee. nunes, whose committee is investigating potential ties between president donald trump’s campaign and russia, visited the white house the night before announcing he had information indicating trump associates may have been subject to some level of intelligence activity before trump took office on jan. 20. “chairman nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” schumer said in a senate speech.

" during his 2016 election campaign, donald trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians. the u.s. embassy would move to jerusalem, he would name an ambassador who backs israeli settlements on land palestinians seek for a state and there would be no pressure for peace talks. but as trump prepares for his first white house meeting with prime minister benjamin netanyahu, his administration has not only toned down its pro israel bravado but also taken the first tentative steps toward a more cautious middle east diplomacy, including consultations with sunni arab allies and u.s. lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. while any strategy is still far from complete, there is growing consensus in the white house that tackling the israeli palestinian conflict could require gentle nudging of israel together with assurances to the arab world that trump will be more even handed than his campaign rhetoric suggested. “this is a case where campaign promises run head on into geopolitical reality and they have to be adjusted accordingly,” said a u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. as a result, relocating the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem – a step world leaders including jordan’s king abdullah warned against and which would probably inflame the muslim world   has been put on hold for now.  at the same time, the white house has adopted a more measured stance on israeli settlement building in occupied territory than candidate trump appeared to advocate. even so, there is little doubt that when netanyahu meets trump on wednesday, he will find a republican president determined to show more warmth to israel than his democratic predecessor, barack obama, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship. social media exchanges have suggested a budding “bromance” between netanyahu and trump, who has pledged to be the “best friend” israel has ever had in the white house. as a result, palestinians fear their leaders will be frozen out and their statehood aspirations pushed aside. one white house aide cautioned that the administration is still in “listening mode” on the issue. since taking office on jan. 20, trump has spoken by phone to egyptian, saudi and united arab emirates leaders and heard abdullah’s concerns in person. all of these countries have growing contacts with israel, mostly behind the scenes and centered on a shared desire to counter iran, a point that netanyahu has often cited as among the grounds for his country’s eventual thaw with the arab world. signaling an emerging view that u.s. arab allies could be helpful on the israeli palestinian issue, trump’s son in law, jared kushner, assigned to a senior role in middle east diplomacy, has met arab officials, including the uae’s ambassador to washington, the new york times reported. in his talks with trump, netanyahu is expected to try to keep the focus on forging a common front against iran, israel’s regional enemy and a target of trump’s ire. the israeli palestinian dispute will nonetheless be on the agenda, especially after israel’s parliament drew international condemnation for approving a law retroactively legalizing 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned palestinian land. barring a curve ball from the sometimes unpredictable u.s. president, trump is unlikely to use the talks to press netanyahu for concessions toward the palestinians in the way obama did. but neither can trump afford to be seen to abandon the u.s. commitment to a two state solution, the bedrock of washington’s middle east policy since the 1993 interim peace accords and a principle embraced internationally. a white house statement on feb. 2 set forth a more nuanced position, backing away from a longstanding u.s. view of settlements as an “impediment” to peace but instead saying new settlements or the expansion of existing ones beyond current boundaries “may not be helpful” to that goal. that shift transpired just hours after trump met briefly with king abdullah on the sidelines of an event in washington. even so, the emerging shape of trump policy remains more accommodating toward israel than at any time since republican george w. bush occupied the white house. “it seems we are headed for a new policy with this administration that is different from its predecessor in how it deals with the palestinian leadership and the palestinian cause,” said wasel abu youssef, a member of the palestine liberation organization’s executive committee.  there has been no contact between the palestinian leadership and the trump administration so far, palestinian officials said. moderate, western backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas was among the first world leaders obama called on his first full day in office in 2009. a white house official insisted, however, that the administration intends to develop a relationship with the palestinian authority. all the same, many israeli officials do not read the white house’s settlements statement as a warning to israel or a reining in of netanyahu. not only does it conclude that settlements do not block peace prospects, it also says construction within established settlements is acceptable to washington. “bibi will be happy,” said an israeli diplomat, using netanyahu’s nickname. “he can put new settlements on hold and hold off the right wing by pointing to trump. at the same time, he can build as much as he wants within existing settlements.” in that regard, the lines drawn by the white house help netanyahu fend off demands from the far right in his coalition for sweeping steps, like annexing portions of the west bank. palestinians would be especially alarmed if trump decided to proceed with moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem, essentially recognizing the city as israel’s capital despite international insistence that its status must be decided in negotiations. the palestinians want east jerusalem, captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as the capital of their future state. trump and his aides have played down the prospects for a quick embassy move since he took office. some experts see a moderating influence in trump’s national security team. it has members such as secretary of state rex tillerson, a former exxon mobil chief executive with extensive contacts among gulf arab governments, and defense secretary jim mattis, a retired marine general. they will have to deal with other, sometimes ideologically driven advisers with close personal ties to trump. david friedman, trump’s former bankruptcy lawyer and now nominee as ambassador to israel, has raised funds for a west bank settlement and voiced doubt about palestinian statehood. kushner’s family has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the same settlement. aides may be moving circumspectly also in hope of keeping the door open if trump – who has touted his skills as a master dealmaker – decides to seek what he has called the “ultimate deal”: israeli palestinian peace.  to pursue such an initiative, the united states needs to be seen as an even handed mediator, while also overcoming the rigid disputes that have scuppered so many peace efforts over the years: settlements, borders, the status of jerusalem, what to do with palestinian refugees, and palestinian political divisions. the last, u.s. brokered round of peace talks collapsed in 2014. it remains to be seen whether the trump administration will be inclined to devote much attention to the israeli palestinian issue at a time when it is distracted by other priorities. in the middle east alone, the fight against islamic state and countering iran are higher on the agenda.  however, if trump at some point does opt to wade in where so many of his predecessors have failed, for netanyahu – who is looking for a reset of u.s. israeli relations – it might be a case of “be careful what you wish for”.

" the german government has approved the sale of three thyssenkrupp submarines to israel and will provide financial support for the purchase, government spokesman steffen seibert told a regular news conference on monday. the estimated $2 billion deal is under police investigation  in israel over suspected corruption and several public officials and private citizens have been questioned in the case. the 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that prime minister benjamin netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented thyssenkrup marine system s local agent, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. the attorney has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with netanyahu. israel s justice ministry said in february that netanyahu himself was not a suspect. addressing israel s parliament, netanyahu told opposition lawmakers that the new deal with germany helped vindicate him.   how sad for you, that you have been staking your hopes on recycling the submarines story, but also understand that this story, too, has been sunk,  he said.  seibert said germany would make a contribution of up to 540 million euros to help finance israel s purchase. seibert said an inter governmental memorandum of understanding approving the deal would be signed later on monday.  i would like to thank (german) chancellor (angela) merkel and her government for this memorandum, which touches on a matter that is very important for israel s national security,  netanyahu said in his speech.

" one of the top candidates for the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) party in this month s election walked out of a live television debate on tuesday night after being accused of failing to distance herself from right wingers. the right wing afd has gained support by slamming chancellor angela merkel s 2015 decision to open the borders to refugees and is set to enter the national parliament for the first time after the sept. 24 election. polls put it on 7 11 percent. alice weidel, 38, collected her papers and rushed out of public broadcaster zdf s studio during a debate with germany s six other major parties after andreas scheuer, a member of  merkel s conservative bloc, said she should distance herself from far right figures in the afd. scheuer said alexander gauland, the afd s other top candidate, was a  radical right winger . gauland has described bjoern hoecke, who in january called for a  180 degree turnaround  in the way germany seeks to atone for nazi crimes, as part of  the soul of the afd . weidel, who styles herself as an economic expert and critic of the euro, has gradually shifted to the right since being chosen as one of the party s chancellor candidates in april. she has called for hoecke to be expelled from the party. in a statement published shortly after her exit, weidel accused zdf moderator marietta slomka of being biased and unprofessional:  ms slomka shouldn t act out her personal animosities in the television show,  she wrote. the afd wants to abolish the license fees that finance germany s public broadcasters. weidel s statement ended with the comment that slomka s behavior was  another reason to refuse to pay the license fee . it did not mention the dispute with scheuer or a preceding fiery discussion on immigration. some media speculated that weidel s exit was set up, with stern magazine s editor in chief andreas petzold writing on twitter:  alice weidel s dramatically staged exit was certainly not spontaneous. this is how the afd cultivates its role as a victim.

" u.s. president donald trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the u.s. central bank, meeting with former federal reserve governor kevin warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “i’ve had four meetings for fed chairman and i’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” trump told reporters on the white house south lawn. trump has previously suggested he may reappoint fed chair janet yellen to the post. jerome powell, one of the current governors on the fed’s board, also met with trump earlier this week about the fed job, the wall street journal reported on friday. trump on friday did not provide details on his meetings.  a new fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the fed’s 2 percent goal. under yellen, the fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond buying program that yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. her term as chair expires in february.  warsh was a fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond buying program. he has called for a revamp of how the fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  treasury yields spurted higher on news of the trump meetings; warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than yellen. “he’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. he is quite a contrast to yellen. it does seem he is the front runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” gennadiy goldberg, interest rates strategist at td securities in new york, said of warsh. as recently as july, trump had not ruled out reappointing yellen, telling the wall street journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. in addition to warsh and powell, stanford university economist john taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the fed board of governors, which is led by the fed chair. there has also been speculation that trump could turn to his top economic aide, gary cohn, for the fed chair position. a fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while warsh and taylor did not respond to requests for comment.

" president donald trump put pressure on democrats on sunday as u.s. lawmakers worked to avoid a government shutdown, saying obamacare would die without a cash infusion the white house has offered in exchange for their agreement to fund his border wall. the escalated push to get trump’s priorities, which democrats reject, into spending legislation could jeopardize prospects for an agreement to keep the government open. if talks fail, the government would shut down on saturday, trump’s 100th day in office. “obamacare is in serious trouble. the dems need big money to keep it going   otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought,” the republican president said in a twitter post. in a second tweet, he added: “the democrats don’t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms 13 gang members.”  ms 13 is a criminal gang with members of central american origin.  the president’s tweets appeared after white house budget director mick mulvaney accused democrats of “holding hostage national security” by opposing $1.5 billion to help build a wall along the u.s. mexico border, one of trump’s top campaign pledges.  democrats have said they would not support legislation that ends federal subsidies to help low income people buy health insurance under the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare. the healthcare law was former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, which republicans are trying to repeal and replace. on sunday, democrats called for trump to stop making “poison pill” demands.     senate democratic leader chuck schumer said negotiations between democrats and republicans in both the house of representatives and the senate were “going quite well” and that he was hopeful a deal could be reached. “the only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy handed, and mixing in and asking for things such as the wall,” schumer told reporters. “we’d ask him to let us do our work, not throw in some last minute poison pills that could undo it, and we could get this done,” he said. trump wants money for the wall included in spending legislation that congress must pass by friday to keep the federal government operating through sept. 30, when the 2017 fiscal year expires. mulvaney and white house chief of staff reince priebus played down the danger of a shutdown. mulvaney said talks between republicans and democrats could produce an agreement as early as sunday. “i’m pretty confident we’re going to get something that’s satisfactory to the president in regard to border security within the current negotiations,” priebus said on nbc’s “meet the press.” homeland security secretary john kelly said trump had been clear about his desire for a wall. “i would suspect he will be insistent on the funding,” he told cnn’s “state of the union.” the white house is expected to address another trump campaign promise this week with a wednesday announcement on tax reform that mulvaney said would offer “governing principles, some guidance, also some indication of what the rates will be.” but he said basic elements of the plan remained undecided, including whether to have deficit funded tax cuts that would not be permanent. “you can either have a small tax cut that’s permanent, or a large tax cut that is short term,” he said. in a tweet on saturday, trump promised that a “big tax reform and tax reduction will be announced next wednesday.” legislative text on tax reform is not expected until june, mulvaney said.    spending legislation will require democratic support to clear the senate, and the white house says it has offered to include $7 billion in obamacare subsidies to help low income americans pay for health insurance, if democrats accept funding for the wall. democrats showed no sign of softening their opposition to wall funding on sunday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on trump and republicans who control the house of representatives and the senate.   “the democrats do not support the wall,” house democratic leader nancy pelosi told nbc’s “meet the press.” “the wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise.” senator richard durbin, an illinois democrat, called on trump to “back off.”  “to think that he would consider shutting down the government of the united states of america over this outlandish proposal of a border wall ... that would be the height of irresponsibility,” he told cnn.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he backs continuing the $1.3 billion in annual military aid that washington sends to egypt, but that its human rights record makes it “more difficult” to support the cairo government. “we give $1.3 billion a year to egypt. i don’t think we should take that away,” ryan said during a meeting with foreign policy reporters at his u.s. capitol office after a visit to israel, egypt, saudi arabia and other countries in the region. he said he had raised the rights issue with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi. the aid package for cairo has been in focus in washington because of growing unease among both ryan’s fellow republicans and democrats that sisi’s government is exploiting security concerns to crack down on dissent. ryan said he told sisi: “you make it more difficult for us to be supportive of you when you have so many human rights violations,” adding that every u.s. official who visited cairo should make that case. however, he stressed that it is essential that washington not allow egypt to become a failed state. ryan also told reporters it was “too soon” to weigh in on an emergency funding “marshall plan” that some lawmakers have proposed to boost countries in the region socially and economically rather than only focus on military aspects in the fight to counter islamic state and other militant groups. “i think it’s too soon to jump to that conclusion,” ryan said, when asked whether he would support some sort of emergency appropriations program like the “marshall plan” suggested by  fellow republican senator lindsey graham.

" up to 300,000 rohingya muslims could flee violence in northwestern myanmar to neighboring bangladesh, a u.n. agency official said on wednesday, warning of a funding shortfall for emergency food supplies for the refugees. according to estimates issued by united nations workers in bangladesh s border region of cox s bazar, arrivals since the latest bloodshed started 12 days ago have already reached 146,000. numbers are difficult to establish with any certainty due to the turmoil as rohingya escape operations by myanmar s military. however, the u.n. officials have raised their estimate of the total expected refugees from 120,000 to 300,000, said dipayan bhattacharyya, who is bangladesh spokesman for the world food programme.   they are coming in nutritionally deprived, they have been cut off from a normal flow of food for possibly more than a month,  he told reuters.  they were definitely visibly hungry, traumatized.   the surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities which are already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in myanmar. many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food. bhattacharyya said the refugees were now arriving by boat as well as crossing the land border at numerous points. another u.n. worker in the area cautioned that the estimates were not  hard science , given the chaos and lack of access to the area on the myanmar side where the military is still conducting its  clearance operation . the source added that the 300,000 number was probably toward the worst case scenario.  the latest violence began when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. the ensuing clashes and a military counter offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to bangladesh. in a letter to the u.n. security council on tuesday, secretary general antonio guterres expressed concern that the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe . based on the prediction that 300,000 could arrive, the wfp calculated that it would need $13.3 million in additional funding to provide high energy biscuits and basic rice rations for four months. bhattacharyya called for donors to meet the shortfall urgently.  if they don t come forward now, we may see that these people would be fighting for food among themselves, the crime rate would go up, violence against women and on children would go up,  he said.

" the top republican in the u.s. house of representatives is expected to reassure business leaders on tuesday that tax reform is on track for this year, despite repeated delays and a string of political distractions from president donald trump. in what is billed as a major speech, house speaker paul ryan will seek to dispel the notion that tax reform is adrift by describing what a u.s. tax code overhaul will look like, according to a source close to ryan’s office.  the speaker will emphasize the importance of permanent reforms and reject the notion that legislation should do little more than reduce tax rates, the source said. he will underscore the need for international corporate tax reforms in remarks to the national association of manufacturers. aides said he is not expected to delve into the details of tax proposals. the wisconsin republican delivered a similar optimistic message to lobbyists and campaign donors in virginia over the weekend, adding that he expected congress to finalize legislation to dismantle obamacare by mid summer, according to a source familiar with the speaker’s comments. originally expected to unveil tax reform legislation in the spring, republicans are under pressure from business lobbyists to make good on campaign pledges to reform the tax code and pass healthcare legislation. lawmakers also need legislative victories to stave off democratic challenges in next year’s congressional mid term elections.          “what ryan needs to do is refocus folks on the rationale for having tax reform, not just the political rationale, but the economic rationale,” said jeff kupfer, a former economic adviser to president george w. bush. markets have been anticipating lower taxes. major stock indexes have hit multiple record highs from trump’s election to the end of the first quarter, on bets he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending. the tax reform debate has largely moved behind closed doors, where ryan is trying to hammer out an agreement with senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, treasury secretary steven mnuchin, white house economic adviser gary cohn and republican chairmen of the two congressional tax committees. the aim is to unveil tax reform legislation in september.  outside those discussions, lawmakers have begun to talk about legislation that would do little more than cut taxes, with temporary reductions financed by the federal deficit.

" airlines were racing against the clock to clear as many customers as possible from the likely florida path of hurricane irma, as social and political pressure mounted for carriers to play a bigger role in aiding evacuations. as the powerful storm threatened to rip through the florida coast by sunday, airlines ramped up the number of flights available out of south florida airports, where operations were likely to temporarily cease through the weekend and beyond.  but flights out of the area remained extremely limited. at miami international airport, many outbound flights were canceled, leaving residents scrambling to rebook to anywhere outside the path of the storm.  american airlines, which has one of the larger operations in south florida, said on thursday it had added 16 flights out of miami, amid more than 2,400 forced cancellations through monday. delta air lines inc said it had upsized aircraft and added flights to increase the number of available outgoing seats by 2,000. united airlines added six flights out of miami to its hubs, including newark, new jersey, and chicago o hare. all three carriers said they planned to mostly wind down south florida operations by friday evening. in areas already pummeled by the powerful storm, flight operations had been rolled back and halted altogether.  a delta operated flight from new york to san juan, puerto rico, and back, made headlines for narrowly avoiding the storm in a mission to evacuate another plane full of passengers from the area ahead of irma s landfall.  flight tracking website flightradar24.com saw the plane land for one last departure in the u.s. territory located squarely in the path of irma s landfall, fill with passengers, and make its successful flight back to new york on wednesday. other airlines had already ceased operations in the region. price gouging  as residents sought to secure last minute flights out of the dangerous category 5 storm s path, airlines faced accusations of trying to capitalize on the panic and chaos by price gouging.   under pressure from some members of congress following social media reports, airlines have taken the unusual step of publicly announcing price caps on tickets out of areas in irma s course. early on, carrier jetblue capped flights out of the area at $99, and other carriers followed suit, capping fares at between $99 and $399 a ticket.  but while airlines offered some cheap flights out of south florida after complaints, passengers said that did little good if all the flights were fully booked or canceled.                         medical student eric slabaugh said he was dismayed by ticket prices over $2,000 when he started looking for flights earlier this week. he got a ticket to detroit for $700, he said,  because nobody wants to go there.                          publix can t charge $50 for a case of water without getting accused of price gouging, but airlines can charge 50 times the price of a normal ticket. i don t think that s fair,  slabaugh said. airlines  customer service practices have come under fire in recent months, and just last year, u.s. carriers were cleared in a federal investigation regarding exorbitant fare mark ups in the wake of a deadly amtrak derailment that drove up demand for air travel on some routes.  senator bill nelson, a florida democrat who had been pressuring airlines to aid in evacuating florida residents, spoke with airline executives on thursday and urged them to add more flight outs of florida.   his office said nelson is  pleased  airlines were doing everything they could to  help get impacted floridians to safety.  the federal aviation administration is holding twice daily phone calls with airlines to talk about airport conditions, but does not plan to close the miami airport on friday, officials said. airlines are still planning for airport closures, however, and said they expect their operations to be impacted in the region at least through the weekend.  also affected by the storm, carnival cruise lines, which has major operations out of florida ports, said on thursday it had canceled four of its caribbean cruises, though it still planned to operate several more under modified itineraries.

" the nominee to be the next u.s. army secretary told lawmakers on thursday that cutting the size of the force had increased the risk to american security and that further reductions would require a rethinking of the army’s role and priorities. eric fanning, a longtime senior defense official who would be the first openly gay military service secretary, told his confirmation hearing that reducing the army to 450,000 troops by 2018 from about 490,000 currently, was manageable but would increase the risk to national security. the pentagon is in the process of cutting almost $1 trillion in projected defense spending over a decade under a 2011 deal approved by the white house and congress. cutting the active duty army to 420,000 soldiers, which could be required if the spending cuts are not reversed, “would require a whole new set of assumptions and guidance on what the army is supposed to do and what its priorities should be,” said fanning, who would replace army secretary john mchugh, who stepped down several months ago. republican presidential candidates have blasted the cuts, promising more military spending to confront international threats including islamic state. fanning would bring unique experience to the job because he has served at senior levels in all three branches of the u.s. armed forces, including stints as acting air force secretary and acting army secretary. members of the senate armed services committee were largely positive about fanning’s nomination, although the panel waited several months to take it up, leading the administration to name him acting army secretary. that prompted republican senator john mccain, chairman of the committee, to write a letter to the white house in november charging fanning’s appointment as acting secretary was a violation of a law barring nominees from taking steps that presume they will be confirmed. while the white house disagreed, fanning stepped down in deference to mccain’s concerns and has since been preparing for the confirmation hearing. advocacy groups said fanning’s nomination was a significant sign of progress in protecting the rights of gays and lesbians to serve in the world’s most powerful military. for many years, the u.s. military followed a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that allowed gays to serve only if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. it abolished that policy in 2011.

" top white house aides steve bannon and jared kushner met and agreed to “bury the hatchet” over their differences, a senior administration official said on saturday, in a bid to stop infighting that has distracted from president donald trump’s message. bannon, trump’s chief strategist, and kushner, an influential adviser and trump’s son in law, met on friday at the request of white house chief of staff reince priebus who told them that if they have any policy differences, they should air them internally, the official said. the development at the president’s mar a lago retreat in palm beach, florida, came at the end of what has been a relatively smooth week for trump. trump ordered airstrikes against syrian targets that drew praise in many parts of the world and staged an error free summit with chinese president xi jinping, complete with his wife, melania, wearing a red dress to symbolize the main color of the chinese flag. priebus’ message to bannon and kushner was to “stop with the palace intrigue” and focus on the president’s agenda, the official told reuters. both aides left having agreed that it was time to “bury the hatchet and move forward,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. four former advisers to the president said trump is accustomed to chaos in his decades long career as a real estate developer but that even he has grown weary of the infighting. “he’s got a long fuse for that kind of thing,” said one former adviser. “i imagine he has gotten tired of this.” the white house dismissed persistent talk that trump might be on the verge of a staff shakeup. “the only thing we are shaking up is the way washington operates as we push the president’s aggressive agenda forward,” spokeswoman lindsay walters said. the trump white house has been a hotbed of palace intrigue since he took office on jan. 20. but the drama has intensified after the failed effort to get healthcare legislation approved by the house of representatives and the rocky rollout of an executive order attempting to temporarily ban citizens of six muslim majority nations from entering the united states. bannon, former chief of the conservative news organization breitbart news, has been at odds with kushner and gary cohn, the head of the white house national economic council, an administration official and the four former advisers said. the former trump advisers said kushner, husband of trump daughter ivanka trump, is trying to tug the president into a more mainstream position, while bannon is trying to keep aflame the nationalist fervor that carried trump to his unexpected election victory on nov. 8. bannon is getting some of the blame for the administration’s early stumbles because, one former adviser said, “the president demands results.”in what was viewed as a sign of bannon’s declining influence, he was removed from his seat on the national security council this week. administration officials said this was done at the urging of national security adviser h.r. mcmaster, with whom bannon had clashed. some of the former trump advisers said priebus is at fault for not gaining control of the feuding and said cohn, a former goldman sachs executive, would be a candidate to replace him. priebus is the former chairman of the republican national committee and bucked many in his party by putting the weight of the rnc behind trump when it was clear he would be the party’s presidential nominee. “”reince is chief of staff,” said a source familiar with the issue. “he’s not going anywhere.” republican strategist charlie black, who has known trump for 30 years, said he did not think a shakeup was imminent and that trump’s white house reflects his traditional approach to running his business. “he’s always had a spokes to the wheel management style,” said black. “he wants people with differing views among the spokes.” bill daley, a former white house chief of staff to president barack obama, who got pushed out in a shakeup himself after roughly a year into the job, said it appears that inside the trump white house there’s a struggle for “the soul and brain of the president.” ",0
" the u.s. state department and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on tuesday stressed the need for ties with the philippines to be based on mutual respect, after manila’s new leader raised worries about the future of the key alliance by calling president barack obama a “son of a bitch.” despite u.s. dismay over duterte’s remarks, current and former u.s. officials played down the impact, saying they did not expect any serious damage to ties at a time of high tensions over china’s extensive territorial claims in asia. the state department said a planned first meeting between obama and his counterpart rodrigo duterte on the sidelines of a regional summit in laos on tuesday was canceled because the tone of the philippine leader’s rhetoric raised questions about the chances of productive talks. “words matter, and we want to see an atmosphere that is cordial and open to strong cooperation,” state department spokesman mark toner told a regular news briefing in washington. clinton, who as secretary of state was an architect of obama’s policy of emphasizing the importance of the asia pacific to u.s. interests in the face of a rising china, said obama was right to cancel the meeting. “when the president of the philippines insulted our president, it was appropriate in a very low key way to say: sorry, no meeting,” she told reporters on her campaign plane. “we have a lot of ties between the united states and the philippines. and i think it’s very important that we have a relationship, but there has to be a certain level of respect that is expected on both sides,” clinton said. duterte made the remark about obama while explaining that he would not be lectured over extrajudicial killings in the war against drugs he has launched since taking over two months ago and which has killed about 2,400 people. he has previously called the pope a “son of a whore” and the u.s. ambassador a “gay son of whore.” the philippines voiced regret for duterte’s comments after obama canceled a formal bilateral meeting. the white house then said obama might speak with duterte informally. duterte’s volatile nature threatens to complicate washington’s ties with its closest ally in southeast asia as it tries to forge a united front in the region in response to china’s extensive claims in the strategic south china sea. the philippines has been central in this effort due to an international court case it brought and won against beijing.  in march, the united states and the philippines agreed on five locations for u.s. military facilities in the country under a new security deal. the deal grants washington increased military presence in its former colony through rotation of ships and planes for humanitarian and maritime security operations.  asked about duterte’s comments, u.s. secretary of defense ash carter said the defense relationship with the philippines was a “strong” and “longstanding” one. speaking to reporters, carter also described the philippines’ new defense minister, delfin lorenzana, as someone who was “very knowledgeable about all the things that we do together.” an official of the u.s. state department said “government to government” relations with manila remained strong. “the areas that we believe we have robust, strong cooperation with them, we are not going to just simply throw that aside.” the official noted that duterte was new to national leadership having served as a city mayor. “he is maybe feeling his way into the new job,” the official said. former u.s. officials said china would be pleased by the u.s. philippines friction.     “time will tell whether president duterte steps back from this episode and realizes he needs to recalibrate his choice of words in engaging u.s. leaders,” said amy searight, a former senior pentagon official now at washington’s center for strategic and international studies think tank. evan medeiros, obama’s former top asia adviser and now a senior analyst at the eurasia group, saw the row as a “speed bump, not a road block” in u.s. philippines ties.     “it’s unfortunate, but doesn’t fundamentally derail the relationship,” he said.

" democratic white house candidate hillary clinton is leading among likely voters aged 18 to 29, according to a harvard university opinion poll released on wednesday. the former u.s. secretary of state had the support of 49 percent of likely voters, ahead of republican rival donald trump’s 28 percent support, a substantially wider lead than democratic president barack obama had over republican former massachusetts governor mitt romney at the same point in 2012. national polls of voters of all ages also show clinton leading, though by a substantially narrower margin. some 14 percent of respondents said they planned to vote for libertarian gary johnson, with 5 percent supporting the green party’s jill stein and 11 percent still undecided. more than one in three self described johnson voters said they were likely to change their minds before election day. a majority of respondents, 51 percent, described themselves as “fearful” about the future of america, with just 14 percent of the 2,150 respondents saying they believed the country was headed in the right direction. the sense of fearfulness was most predominant among white respondents, though 85 of black respondents said they believed they were “under attack” in modern american society. some 62 percent of respondents said they believed race relations in the united states would worsen if trump was elected president. twenty two percent thought race relations would deteriorate if clinton won the nov. 8 election, with the plurality, 36 percent predicting they would stay the same. the survey, conducted oct. 7 17 has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way.

" north korea has granted a soccer loving malaysian prince access to its airspace  anytime  he wants, his palace said on tuesday, as pyongyang prepares finally to host an asian cup tie that became a casualty of the assassination in malaysia of the north korean leader s estranged half brother in february. having been delayed twice due to malaysia s fears for the safety of its players, the match between north korea and malaysia is now set to be played on oct. 5. the game had originally been scheduled for march 28, but the two formerly friendly governments suffered a diplomatic meltdown as north korea reacted angrily to malaysian police investigating the role north korean officials allegedly played in the murder of kim jong nam at kuala lumpur international airport. the president of the football association of malaysia (fam) tunku ismail sultan ibrahim, the crown prince of the southern state of johor, met with north korea s senior most diplomat in malaysia on tuesday to discuss the match, according to a statement from the johor palace.  amongst issues discussed were foreign relations and current affairs as well as the upcoming group b match of the afc asian cup uae 2019 qualifying final round, in which both teams will ensure the safety of players and team officials,  the statement said. north korea also granted the prince  full access  to its airspace  anytime  he wants to visit north korea from malaysia, the palace statement said.  it is the highest honor as any other world leader will need to stop by in beijing beforehand,  it said. the trial of two women, an indonesian and a vietnamese, charged for the murder of kim, is set to begin in kuala lumpur on oct.2, but the north koreans sought by police were believed to have fled malaysia soon after the murder. the meeting took place on the same day as the opening of the united nations general assembly in new york, where u.s. president donald trump delivered a stern warning to north korea over its ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests.

" authorities in china s far western region of xinjiang have in recent months detained up to 30 relatives of an exiled ethnic uighur leader, rebiya kadeer, rights group amnesty international said on tuesday. it was not possible to independently verify the report. xinjiang, where hundreds have died in recent years in violence between majority han chinese and ethnic uighurs who call xinjiang home, is under tight security and independent reporting there is difficult. uighurs are a mostly muslim people who speak a turkic language. a xinjiang government news department official declined to comment, saying she was unaware of the report. china s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. kadeer is a former political prisoner in china accused of leaking state secrets in 1999. she was later allowed to leave on medical grounds and lives in the united states. she is president of the world uyghur congress. amnesty said that among those detained were kadeer s sisters, brothers, sons, grandchildren and extended relatives.  some of her relatives have been detained or jailed previously in xinjiang. the rights group said in an emailed statement that it was unclear when they were taken away, and that they were  presumed  to be held at a so called education center and risked torture.  these facilities are known to arbitrarily detain uighurs and other muslim minorities for 6 12 months or more,  it said.   forced to study chinese laws and policies, many of those detained are targeted because they may have been found praying, owning religious books, have traveled abroad, or have family members living abroad,  it said. the chinese government routinely denies accusations of rights abuses in xinjiang, though it has admitted a problem with torture of detainees and has pledged to stop mistreatment of prisoners. xinjiang, on the borders of central asia, afghanistan and pakistan, is one of china s most sensitive domestic issues and where china says it faces its own war on radical islam and militancy.  rights groups and uighur exiles say the unrest is more a product of uighur frustration at chinese controls on their culture and religion. china denies any repression.

" the u.s. government on friday gave companies an extra year to comply with an obama era regulation meant to crack down on corporations that try to minimize their u.s. tax bills by shifting profits abroad to countries with lower tax rates. the regulation, known in corporate tax circles as the “385 rule,” is intended to combat a tax avoidance technique called earnings stripping, in which multinational corporations transfer taxable income from a u.s. subsidiary to a foreign affiliate in the guise of tax deductible interest payments on internal debt.   the rule, which treasury secretary steven mnuchin is now reviewing as part of the trump administration’s push for deregulation, seeks to eliminate the incentive for earnings stripping by reclassifying certain loans as equity under section 385 of the u.s. tax code. the change converts tax deductible interest payments employed by the schemes into taxable stock dividends. finalized last october, the regulation required corporations to file documentation on their internal loans with the irs by a january 2018 deadline. in a public notice issued on friday, the treasury and internal revenue service pushed the deadline back to january 2019.

" kenya s election commission on monday set oct. 17 as the date for a new vote ordered by the supreme court when it annulled an august poll won by president uhuru kenyatta. the election will feature kenyatta who is running for a second term and opposition leader raila odinga, the commission said. a presidential spokesman said the government will not replace the election board ahead of the election, setting up a potential showdown between the government and the opposition. kenyatta won the aug. 8 vote by 1.4 million votes. the court on friday said the election commission had not followed proper procedures and ordered it to hold a new vote within 60 days. it did not stipulate any personnel changes. the decision shocked some in kenya and was seen by many as a step forward for democracy in the country because it appeared to set an example of judicial independence.  odinga, who lost the two previous elections, welcomed the judgment and called for senior officials at the election board to resign and face possible prosecution. spokesmen for kenyatta and the election board rejected a change to the entire board.  the supreme court gave clear guidance on who will hold the repeat election. you cannot accept one half of the verdict of the supreme court and not the other,  said presidential spokesman manoah esipisu.  andrew limo, a spokesman for the electoral board, said the situation was complicated by the fact that the court would not release its full verdict until sept. 21.  judges read short remarks criticizing the process but did not go into detail, saying they needed more time to consider more than 80,000 pages submitted as evidence.  if you want to punish people, you must have a basis for it. but the only basis is the full judgment of the supreme court, which will not be out until 21 days,  limo said.   otherwise the commission could get into a position of defending itself in court from people who were dismissed.    odinga s spokesman was not immediately available to  comment.

" the russian foreign ministry accused the obama administration of destroying relations with moscow in the run up to the u.s. presidential election next month, saying on thursday that it hoped the next occupants of the white house would be better. in comments that underline how deeply a hacking scandal and differences over syria and ukraine have damaged u.s. russia relations, maria zakharova, the foreign ministry’s spokeswoman, told a news conference washington was playing a dangerous game. “we see with regret how washington continues to destroy our bilateral relations,” said zakharova. “the level of russophobic propaganda coming from the very top is now starting to go off the scale.” calling white house accusations russia was behind a hacking campaign against democratic party organizations “a lie,” she accused the obama administration of trying to make u.s. voters perceive russia as the enemy. “we have the growing feeling that the outgoing u.s. administration is applying scorched earth tactics to our bilateral relations,” she said, saying such an approach was dangerous and could affect international stability. zakharova also warned washington to think twice before taking any retaliatory action over the hacking scandal, suggesting the obama administration was gearing up to use the scandal as a pretext to launch its own cyber attacks on russia.  detailing russian concerns over what it believes is a nato build up along its borders, she accused u.s. officials at the international monetary fund and world bank of trying to block funds for russia related projects.  “of course, we understand that all these steps are being made to serve america’s internal pre election set up,” said zakharova. “(but) nobody should be under illusions that it’s possible to put pressure on russia, neither today’s u.s. authorities or the people who replace them. we want to hope strongly that the new people will be smarter than the old lot.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump plans to nominate former treasury official randal quarles to be the federal reserve’s top banking regulator, the white house said on monday. if confirmed by the senate, quarles would be the first vice chair of supervision at the fed, a role created after the 2008 financial crisis but never filled during the obama administration. quarles is viewed as an industry friendly figure who will likely listen to banks that have complained about the impact of regulations implemented since the financial meltdown. his nomination has been widely expected since april. former fed governor daniel tarullo effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in february, overseeing a strict implementation of the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law and administering rigorous “stress tests” annually to banks on how prepared they are to withstand unexpected shocks. quarles currently runs a private investment firm that he founded, the cynosure group, from salt lake city, utah. he was previously a partner at private equity firm the carlyle group. he was also under secretary for domestic finance at the treasury under president george w. bush and was the u.s. executive director of the international monetary fund. in an opinion piece in the wall street journal in march 2016, quarles and lawrence goodman, another former u.s. treasury official, argued against breaking up big banks because it would risk damaging the wider economy. he has also talked about refining obama era financial rules, introduced after the financial crisis. quarles will be a central figure in pushing the trump administration’s plans to loosen the leash put on wall street banks following the crisis.  trump laid out his plans last month but he needs officials at key regulatory posts to carry out his agenda. he has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies, but only treasury secretary steven mnuchin and securities and exchange commission chairman jay clayton have been approved by congress. other agencies are either awaiting presidential picks or are operating under “acting” chiefs. others have leaders appointed by trump’s democratic predecessor, president barack obama.

" former british prime minister edward heath would have been questioned about claims he sexually abused boys if he were alive today, police said on thursday after a two year investigation into the allegations. supporters of heath, who never married, have said the investigation was an expensive, flawed witch hunt.  heath, who was prime minister from 1970 to 1974 and died 12 years ago, would have been interviewed under caution over seven allegations including raping an 11 year old boy and indecently assaulting men and other boys, one aged 10. the alleged incidents occurred from 1956 to 1992 while he was a member of parliament but not prime minister, said wiltshire police, the force in western england which headed the national investigation named operation conifer.  i am satisfied there were compelling and obvious reasons to investigate allegations made against sir edward heath,  wiltshire chief constable mike veale told reporters, adding the report did not suggest or conclude guilt.  the allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people. it would be an indefensible dereliction of my public duty as a chief constable not to have investigated such serious allegations against a former prime minister, even though he is deceased.  in total, 40 individuals came forward with accusations against heath. of these, evidence undermining the claims were found in 19 cases and three accusers later concluded they were mistaken in naming the ex prime minister. but heath would have been quizzed over seven accusations, although police refused to say whether there was other corroborating evidence. the first occurred in 1961 when heath, who then had the title  lord privy seal , is alleged to have raped and indecently assaulted a boy  during a paid sexual encounter in a private dwelling .  other claims also related to  paid encounters , including one when he was trade minister, as well as during chance meetings. paul mills, the officer who led the investigation, said no accusations had been made against heath while he was alive and there had been no missed opportunities by police.  heath became prime minister in 1970 and most notably negotiated britain s entry into the european economic community, which later became the european union. he was ousted from office in 1974 when he lost two elections after a miners  strike helped bring down the government. he then lost the conservative party leadership in 1975 to margaret thatcher, whom he never forgave and repeatedly criticized in what detractors described as  the longest sulk in history . he remained a lawmaker until 2001 and four years later  aged 89. an artillery officer in world war two, heath was very private and was widely regarded as an awkward, prickly man with little gift for small talk. he was passionate about music and sailing, owning five racing yachts named morning cloud, and once winning the sydney to hobart race.  heath s godson, artist lincoln seligman, said the 1.5 million pound ($2 million) police investigation had cast a stain on a man who could not defend himself.  if allegations are out there he might easily have been called in for questioning,  he told bbc radio.  so, yes, they had to question him, but that tells us nothing.  in a joint statement, robert armstrong, heath s former cabinet secretary, and david hunt, chairman of the sir edward heath charitable foundation, said there should be a judge led review of the evidence. they called the police report  highly unsatisfactory .  all those who knew sir edward heath or worked with him are, without exception, convinced that the allegations of child abuse will all be found to be groundless,  they said. britain has been jolted by a series of high profile child abuse scandals in recent years. the most notable involved the late tv and radio presenter jimmy savile. a five year public inquiry is now looking into whether powerful figures in politics, churches, or local government helped hide abuses.

" mylan nl chief executive officer heather bresch will appear at a sept. 21 congressional hearing over price increases for its epipen emergency allergy treatment, the u.s. house of representatives oversight committee said in a statement on wednesday. mylan has been widely criticized, including by u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, for sharply raising the price of epipens, which are carried by people with life threatening allergies. mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of epipen auto injectors to $600. the price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008.  mylan spokeswoman nina devlin confirmed that bresch will attend the hearing. “heather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information,” said evercore isi analyst umer raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the committee.  a probe into epipen pricing by a u.s. senate subcommittee was announced on sept. 7. bresch is the daughter of u.s. senator joe manchin, a democrat from west virginia. the house panel co chairmen, republican representative jason chaffetz and democratic representative elijah cummings, noted there is “... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of epipens.” the committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the epipen market and speed approval by the food and drug administration (fda) of generic alternatives, according to the statement. in response to the furor, mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of epipen for $300. teva pharmaceutical industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to epipen, said last week that it hopes to gain u.s. approval by late 2017 or early 20018. epipen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto injected devices. the committee said it also planned to call as a witness dr doug throckmorton, the fda’s deputy director at the center for drug evaluation and research.

" china s parliament on wednesday said part of a high speed railway station being built in hong kong would be regarded as mainland territory governed by mainland laws, an unprecedented move that critics say further erodes the city s autonomy. hong kong reverted from british to chinese rule in 1997, when it was granted a high degree of autonomy under a  one country, two systems  arrangement, giving it a separate police force, immigration controls, an independent judiciary and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland china. china s largely rubber stamp parliament, the national people s congress, voted to allow chinese immigration checks and the enforcement of mainland chinese laws within part of the station, so that after boarding the train in hong kong passengers would not need to get off the train for immigration checks at the hong kong mainland border.  it is appropriate ... that the mainland port area within the west kowloon station would be regarded as belonging to mainland china,  according to the legislative document released by parliament on the decision.  critics say the  co location  arrangement, also known as  one land, two checks  in chinese, sets a dangerous precedent as it violates the city s mini constitution, the basic law, in which article 18 explicitly states national laws, with a few exceptions, do not apply in hong kong. but the document passed by parliament says since mainland officials  operations will be strictly confined to specific areas in the station, it is  different  from the article which governs the whole of hong kong.  setting up a mainland port area inside the west kowloon station does not change the administrative area of the hong kong special administrative region, does not affect the hksar s right to a high degree of autonomy accorded by the law, does not reduce or harm (hong kong) residents  rights and freedoms accorded by the law,  the document added. li fei, deputy secretary general of parliament s standing committee, told reporters the decision would not take away hong kong people s freedoms.  if hong kongers don t feel comfortable, they can use another entry port and not take the high speed train,  li said. at a cost of more than hk$84 billion ($11 billion), the express rail link will link up with the rest of china s high speed rail network and roughly halve the journey time between hong kong and the southern chinese city of guangzhou to 48 minutes.  it is expected to be operational in the autumn on 2018.  the hong kong government said it would seek to put draft laws to its legislature by early february to implement the plan, but the bill is expected to be voted through without strong resistance after a series of controversial court cases stripped the opposition pro democracy camp of its veto power. the prospect of beijing tightening its grip on the financial hub has already stoked social tensions and protests including the 2014  occupy  street demonstrations that demanded, in vain, full democracy for the city of 7.3 million. the abductions of a hong kong based bookseller in 2015 who later showed up across the border in chinese custody also touched a raw nerve.   the former head of hong kong s legislature and pro establishment heavyweight, jasper tsang, wrote in a column last week that the government should  admit frankly  the arrangement does not comply with the basic law. opposition lawmaker and barrister tanya chan, who leads a group against the arrangement, said the issue represents the  most serious violation of the basic law  since the 1997 handover.  what we re seeing is the central government exercising overall jurisdiction over hong kong,  chan said.  what we see today is the (npc) standing committee ruling hong kong, zero degree of autonomy.  constitutional law professor albert chen said he believed the arrangement was based on  reasonable arguments  and did not violate the basic law. but it remained  a grey area  whether hong kong courts could handle judicial reviews that directly challenge beijing s decision, he said.  hong kong leader carrie lam welcomed the decision, but conceded that there had been  complex issues of applicability of mainland and hong kong laws  for the project as it had been first conceived around a decade ago. she added that these complexities could not have been foreseen back then.

" zimbabwe opposition leader morgan tsvangirai is  out of danger  in hospital in south africa after being airlifted from harare at the weekend following the sudden onset of severe vomiting, a party source said on tuesday. tsvangirai, who is due to challenge president robert mugabe in elections next year, was recovering well but had been told by doctors to avoid stress and strain until at least the weekend, the source said. the 65 year old s symptoms came on suddenly at a meeting of his opposition coalition, the movement for democratic change (mdc), on thursday evening in kadoma, a city around 160 km (100 miles) southwest of the zimbabwe capital. the mdc sought to play down tsvangirai s hospitalization, describing it as  routine  and denying local media reports that he was on life support after being airlifted to johannesburg in the early hours of saturday morning. tsvangirai has been receiving treatment for colon cancer since last year but says he is in good health. his sudden illness was not thought to be related to his cancer or cancer treatment, two party sources told reuters. it comes a month after vice president emmerson mnangagwa, a favorite to succeed 93 year old mugabe, was rushed to south africa for emergency medical care. mnangagwa, who has since returned, denied local media reports he had been poisoned.

" khaliluddin ismail returned home on sunday after five months of war in the southern philippines to find his house ransacked. but he s still smiling.  at least we have something left,  he said, standing in a room with clothes, toys, ornaments and damaged pictures strewn across the floor.  others have nothing. they lost their homes, they lost their lives.  ismail, 44, the imam of a nearby mosque, considers himself one of the luckiest people in marawi. the city was devastated by more than 150 days of battles between government forces and pro islamic state militants that killed more than 1,100 people and displaced some 350,000. his house is in marawi s safe zone, an area long abandoned by residents but untouched by unrelenting shelling and military air strikes that have all but flattened the city s commercial heart, destroying thousands of homes, shops and vehicles. six days after troops killed the last remaining rebels, ismail was among about 4,000 people allowed to return to their homes on sunday in marawi s basak malutlot area. many like him have discovered their houses were looted and left in disarray.  i opened the door and i was shocked, but i m still happy to be home,  he said. ismail fled with his family on may 24 during a fierce three day firefight that erupted just 50 meters away, when security forces tried to raid the hideout of notorious militant leader isnilon hapilon, islamic state s anointed  emir  in southeast asia. hapilon escaped, then issued a call to arms to hundreds of insurgents to initiate their planned takeover of marawi. it sparked the philippines  biggest urban battle in recent history, and fears that islamic state s extremist agenda had gained a foothold in the south of the mainly catholic country. there were scenes of joy and chaos as a convoy of returning residents poured in to marawi to a cacophony of horns and whistles, jamming what only a few hours earlier were deserted streets. armed police at checkpoints cross checked documents and pictures of each passengers from the 712 families, to guard against possible infiltration by militants. babies cried as officials at a public hall shouted on megaphones to try to establish order as hundreds jostled to register for the sack of rice and 5,000 pesos ($97) allocated to each household. with a stern face, the district s elderly chairwoman, jamellah indol saro, yelled in the local maranao dialect at anxious residents to calm down.  i told them we have to thank allah we re still alive,  she said, smiling. some 6,500 families are due to return this week in a phased repatriation, a fraction of the 77,000 that fled to evacuation camps or nearby towns. many face a lengthy wait for vast swathes of marawi to be rebuilt. retired government employee mitormar goling, 72, came home to find jewellery, money, furniture and antiques had been stolen. he said he feared he would have starved or been killed had he stayed behind.  we felt the ground trembling from the air strikes. we didn t know if the army could protect us,  said goling, wearing sunglasses and a white skull cap.  if you don t believe in their ideology, isis sees you as the enemy,  he said, referring to islamic state. he was among many people who said they understood that the military had to destroy the city to save it. norida manna s three storey house was levelled by an air strike, but she s thankful she s alive.  the office clerk and single mother of six will now live at her sister s home, from which she fled in may as troops outside battled hooded, black clad gunmen who helped the escape of hapilon. the rebel commander was subsequently killed in a military operation 13 days ago.   my home was destroyed, but i don t blame the military. they had a job to do,  she said.  i have nothing left, but to us, every day is a happy one now.

" poland s ruling pis party and president andrzej duda say they are closer to a compromise on overhauling the judiciary, an issue that has divided the once close political allies and worried the european union.  in july duda, who was backed by pis, the law and justice party, in the 2015 presidential election, unexpectedly vetoed the ruling party s judicial reform proposals following nationwide protests and warnings from poland s western allies about politicization of the courts. the veto raised questions about whether pis would uphold its support for duda in the next presidential election.  in september the president made counter proposals which still envisaged greater political control over the courts but to be exercised by the president and not by the justice minister, as well as parliament. lawmakers from both pis and opposition parties criticized the president s proposals, but since then duda and pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski have met to discuss the reform, struggling to reach a compromise.  after the latest meeting, which ended on friday, representatives of both sides said compromise was nearing.  law and justice has made huge concessions when it comes to the judiciary reform. (...) i think that we are close to an agreement,  a pis spokeswoman told broadcasters.  she added that pis agreed on duda s proposal that parliament will need a three fifths majority to appoint new top judges as well as to reduce the influence of the justice minister on courts. duda s top aide krzysztof szczerski was quoted as saying by the state run news agency pap that the meeting with kaczynski was  a step towards achieving a shared, compromise version of the judiciary reforms within the boundaries of the bills recently submitted to parliament by the president .

" british aid minister priti patel was forced from office on wednesday over undisclosed meetings with israeli officials after prime minister theresa may sought to reassert her diminished authority as she negotiates brexit. patel, a brexit campaigner who is popular in the ruling conservative party, had to abandon a trip to africa earlier on wednesday after being summoned by may to answer questions on more unsanctioned meetings that breached diplomatic protocol. after a hastily arranged meeting not long after patel landed in london, may s office released her minister s letter of resignation, in which patel said her conduct in israel had fallen  below the high standards  required of her post.  while my actions were meant with the best of intentions, my actions also fell below the standards of transparency and openness that i have promoted and advocated,  patel wrote in the letter to may.  i offer a fulsome apology to you and to the government for what has happened and offer my resignation.  may responded in a letter, saying:  now that further details have come to light, it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated.  it was not clear who would replace patel, who held the meetings during a holiday in israel earlier this year. under british protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with palestinians. it is the second resignation in may s top team in a week, underlining her weakness at a time when she faces the complicated task of unravelling more than 40 years of ties with the european union and holding a deeply divided party together. patel s meetings with israeli officials, which may s office said they were not aware of, and a reported visit to an israeli army field hospital in the golan heights, have increased the pressure on the prime minister, who depends on a northern irish party in parliament to pass legislation. but while acting quickly to force patel to resign, the loss of an enthusiastic brexit campaigner from her cabinet team of top ministers could mean that may faces greater pressure from lawmakers to pursue a clean break from the eu.  priti is more popular than theresa, and has more contacts and influence overseas,  a senior conservative source said.   if i was may, i wouldn t want priti unleashed on the back benches,  the source said, using a term to describe lawmakers. patel was sacked a week after may s ally michael fallon, her defense secretary, resigned in a sexual harassment scandal that was also caught up two other ministers, including her deputy, damian green.  in a week of crises, her foreign minister, boris johnson, on tuesday was pressed to apologize over remarks he made about a jailed aid worker in iran, which critics said could prompt the islamic republic to hand her a longer jail term. with brexit talks all but hamstrung over how much britain should pay to leave the european union, opposition lawmakers and other critics are now openly questioning whether may can continue as prime minister.  there are times when a government has the stench of death about it,  pat mcfadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition  labour party, told parliament on tuesday.

" randal quarles, u.s. president donald trump’s pick for banking oversight at the federal reserve, told lawmakers on thursday he would ensure more transparency around how the central bank scrutinizes major lenders’ preparedness for crisis in its annual stress tests. “i do think the fed can look at being more transparent about those activities and do it in a way that doesn’t reduce the effectiveness of those tests,” quarles told a confirmation hearing at the senate banking committee. “if you are clear about what you expect you will get more compliance.”  quarles, a former wall street lawyer and u.s. treasury official, is expected to be confirmed as vice chairman for supervision at the federal reserve, a post that will be key to trump’s plan to loosen the leash put on big banks following the 2008 financial crisis. viewed as an industry friendly figure who has spoken out in the past against breaking up big banks, quarles said he would work to simplify the volcker rule, which bans banks from making speculative bets with their own money. wall street has criticized the rule as unworkable, arguing it was impossible for banks to determine when a trade is purely for profit as opposed to creating market liquidity. quarles told senators that he agreed with former fed governor daniel tarullo, who effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in february, that some changes to the existing financial rules were needed, including raising the threshold at which banks are labeled “systematically important” and the level at which stress tests kick in. if confirmed, quarles will also vote on monetary policy as a member of the fed’s board of governors. a previous proponent of using the taylor rule, an interest rate forecasting model, to guide interest rate decisions, he told the committee he no longer held that view, putting him in back in line with the central bank’s current policymakers. “i think that the taylor rule is merely one example of a rule and i am not advocating the adoption of the taylor rule to guide fed policy,” he said. quarles was appearing in front of the committee with joseph otting, the nominee to be comptroller of the currency, which regulates national banks. opposition senators attacked both men’s record in the aftermath of the financial crisis. otting was a former chief executive of one west, a californian lender that foreclosed on 36,000 homes after striking a lucrative deal with the federal deposit insurance corp. quarles meanwhile, benefited from government support for troubled and failed banks when he worked at private equity firm carlyle. “mr. otting’s bank made money by kicking seniors out of their homes and then turned around and said the government made them do it,” said democratic senator sherrod brown. “mr. quarles bemoaned the role of the government as a player in the financial sector rather than as a referee. those sentiments would ring a little less hollow had their banks not accepted $2.5 billion from fdic to protect them from losses.” given that current senate rules require only a slim majority to approve presidential nominees, neither is expected to face a realistic threat to their confirmation. a spokeswoman for the senate banking committee has declined to comment on how quickly the panel could vote on the pair, but senate republicans agreed to stay in session two additional weeks in august with an eye toward working through a backlog of nominees.

" myanmar government forces found on sunday the bodies of 28 hindu villagers who authorities suspected were killed by muslim insurgents last month, at the beginning of a spasm of violence that has sent 430,000 muslim rohingya fleeing to bangladesh. the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) insurgent group denied killing the hindus saying it did not attack civilians. the latest violence in western myanmar s rakhine state began on aug. 25 when arsa militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing a sweeping government offensive in the north of rakhine state in response to those attacks.  the government of buddhist majority myanmar has said more than 400 people have been killed, most of them insurgents. it rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it is fighting  terrorists. members of the small hindu minority appear to have been caught in the middle. some have fled to bangladesh, complaining of violence against them by soldiers or buddhist vigilantes. others have complained of being attacked by the insurgents on suspicion of being government spies. the government said a search was mounted near ye baw kya village in the north of rakhine state after a refugee in bangladesh contacted a hindu community leader in myanmar. the refugee said about 300 arsa militants had marched about 100 people out of the village on aug. 25 and killed them.  twenty of the dead were female and eight were male children,  the government said.  they forced eight female villagers to convert to the islamic religion and took them to bangladesh,  the government said. a government spokesman, zaw htay, said the security forces were investigating. access to the area by journalists as well as human rights workers and aid workers is largely restricted and reuters could not independently verify the report. an arsa spokesman said he believed buddhist nationalists trying to divide hindus and muslims were behind the  lies  that arsa militants had killed the villagers.  arsa has internationally pledged not to target civilians and that remains unchanged no matter what,  the spokesman, who is based in a neighboring country and identified himself only as abdullah, told reuters through a messaging service. the violence in rakhine state and the exodus of refugees is the biggest crisis the government of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced since it came to power last year as part of a transition away from nearly 50 years of harsh military rule. bangladesh and aid organizations are struggling to help the rohingya refugees there, while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the north of rakhine state, where rights groups say nearly half of all muslim villages have been torched. the united states and the united nations have called for an end to the violence, unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone and for the right of those who have fled to go home safely.      suu kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. the chairman of the association of south east asian nations (asean), of which myanmar is a member, issued a statement urging all parties to avoid worsening the situation on the ground and calling for a  viable and long term solutions to the root causes of the conflict . muslim majority indonesia and malaysia have expressed concern about the situation, with malaysia in particular being critical of myanmar. in a rare show of disagreement in the 10 member grouping, foreign minister anifah aman later said malaysia disassociated itself from the statement as it misrepresented the  reality of the situation  and did not identify the rohingya as one of the affected communities. myanmar objects to the term rohingya, saying the muslims of rakhine state are not a distinct ethnic group but illegal immigrants from bangladesh.  this month, malaysia summoned myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over the violence in myanmar. it also  expressed grave concerns over such atrocities which have unleashed a full scale humanitarian crisis .

" france s foreign ministry said on wednesday it was taking accusations by the united states that iran had violated two u.n. security council resolutions seriously and urged iran to comply with all its international commitments.  the united states ambassador to the united nations nikki haley accused iran on tuesday of supplying yemen s houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into saudi arabia in july and called for the u.n. to hold tehran accountable for violating two u.n. security council resolutions.  we take these american indications seriously and attach utmost importance to iran s compliance with all of its international obligations, including the weapons  transfer bans provided for in un security council resolutions 2216 and 2231,  deputy foreign ministry spokesman alexandre georgini told reporters in a daily briefing. he did not respond when asked whether paris supported potential measures at the security council. france s foreign minister jean yves le drian has said that he expected a  challenging  meeting with his iranian counterpart in tehran when he travels there later this month. he is due to discuss iran s ballistic missile program, which paris says goes against u.n. security council resolutions, and its regional activities.   we have deep disagreements with iran (on the ballistic issue) ... and the way in which iran is discreetly or through proxies trying to create a direct channel to the mediterranean,   he said after a security council meeting at the united nations on oct. 31.

" president donald trump will visit a border protection facility in a town along the u.s. mexican border in arizona on tuesday as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built, administration officials said on monday. trump, who has struggled to persuade the republican led congress to approve funding for a project many see as unnecessary, is to visit the facility in yuma, arizona. the border area at yuma is considered a success story for the u.s. border patrol because illegal crossings have slowed as a result of the border installation. trump will not go to the border wall at yuma as officials had said earlier in the day. instead, he will tour a u.s. customs and border patrol hangar and see some of the equipment used to monitor the border, including a predator drone, a patrol boat and a surveillance truck, the officials said. during his visit, trump will be briefed on border patrol efforts in the region and the need for more funding for immigration and border officials to carry out the republican president’s desire for sharp limits on illegal immigration, the officials said. the proposed border wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the united states, was one of trump’s major 2016 campaign promises. his vow that mexico would pay for the wall, which the mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors. trump has since said he will find a way for mexico to repay the united states for construction of the wall but that congress would need to fund it first.

" u.s. representative peter defazio on wednesday unveiled legislation to tax financial trades that will likely wither in congress but could stoke partisan fires in the presidential election. the oregon democrat’s bill would levy a 0.03 percent tax on most financial trades, and is intended to discourage “risky trading behaviors.” defazio expects that will collect more than $417 billion in revenue in the next decade, which he said could be used to fund free higher education or infrastructure repairs. when the democratic party gathers in philadelphia for its national convention at the end of the month, it will adopt a platform that calls for taxing trades. many liberals in the party embrace the proposal as a way to curb speculative trading, which they say led to both the 2007 09 financial crisis and the 2010 stock market “flash crash.” the party’s left wing, led by u.s. senator bernie sanders, who ran against hillary clinton for the presidential nomination, meanwhile, has pushed for free university education. “thanks to the reckless greed of wall street over the past few decades, the american economy is a grossly unbalanced playing field,” said defazio. “the only way we can level it is if we rein in reckless speculative financial trading and curb near instantaneous high volume trades that create instability in the stock market and our national economy.” the legislation is supported by democratic party stalwarts, including the afl cio labor union federation, the americans for financial reform coalition, the communications workers of america union, and advocacy group public citizen. the center for economic and policy research said it also backs the bill. it will likely not get far. republicans control both chambers of congress, and most say that wall street regulation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been overly restrictive. in addition, the republican party generally favors having fewer taxes. “i am opposed to any taxes that would raise the cost of financial transactions,” said randy neugebauer, the republican chairman of a house subcommittee on financial institutions, noting that the bill would tax stock, bond and derivatives trades.  currently, the top u.s. securities regulator, the securities and exchange commission, charges a tax on security futures of less than half of a penny to recover the costs of regulating markets and financial professionals. the idea for the tax can be traced back to economist john maynard keynes, who wrote in 1935 after another devastating financial crisis   the great depression   that a transfer tax on all transactions might mitigate speculation.

" china s military is preparing a sweeping leadership reshuffle, dropping top generals, including two that sources say are under investigation for corruption. the changes would make room for president xi jinping to install trusted allies in key positions at a key party congress that begins on oct 18. a list of 303 military delegates to the communist party congress, published by the army s official newspaper on wednesday, excluded fang fenghui and zhang yang, both members of the central military commission. the commission is china s top military decision making body. reuters reported this week that the 66 year old fang, who accompanied xi to his first meeting with u.s. president donald trump in april, is being questioned on suspicion of corruption. three sources familiar with the matter said zhang, the director of the military s political work department, is also the subject of a probe. china s defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment. the personnel changes herald a clean sweep of the top ranking generals heading up the department. all three of zhang s deputies   jia tingan, du hengyan and wu changde   were also missing from the list of congress delegates.  this is a very clear message: they re out,  said cheng li, an expert on chinese elite politics at the brookings institution.  their political careers have come to an end.  on friday, news reports carried by the people s liberation army daily and the official news agency xinhua abruptly referred to the navy s political commissar, miao hua, as the political work department director, despite no official announcement of zhang being replaced in his role. the department is in charge of imbuing political thought and makes military personnel decisions in a similar vein to the communist party s organisation department. the political work department used to be headed by xu caihou, who along with a fellow former vice chairman of the military commission, guo boxiong, was accused of taking bribes in exchange for promotions. guo was jailed for life last year, while xu died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial. also among the key omissions from the list published wednesday were du jincai, who was replaced as the military s anti corruption chief in march, and cai yingting, who left his post as head of the pla academy of military science in january. taking into account officials who are likely to retire, as many as seven of the 11 spots on the military commission may be vacated, strengthening talk in chinese political circles that the body may be streamlined.  xi, who is commander in chief of china s armed forces, currently chairs the commission, which also comprises two vice chairmen and eight committee members.  two sources familiar with the matter said the commission may be cut down to xi and four vice chairmen, doing away with committee members and streamlining reporting lines.  li, the brookings expert, said that among those likely to be central to the army s refreshed leadership were li zuocheng, who took over from fang as chief of the joint staff department last month, miao and the three commanders of the army s ground, air and naval forces: han weiguo, ding laihang and shen jinlong.  the fact that all five were newly appointed this year and none were members of the communist party s 200 odd strong central committee, li said, reflected the extent to which xi was rejuvenating the leadership as part of his years long drive to modernize the military and make it more ready for combat.  this is really a major step from xi jinping to consolidate his authority to promote the young, those who have some professional experience,  but are  not corrupted, and certainly not belonging to the factions of guo boxiong and xu caihou,  he said.

" u.s. government experts think north korea could conduct a new missile test within days, in what would be its first launch since it fired a missile over japan in mid september, two  authoritative u.s. government sources said on tuesday. one of the sources, who did not want to be identified, said the united states had evidence that japanese reports about the monitoring of signals suggesting north korea was preparing a new missile test were accurate.  both sources said u.s. government experts believed a new test could occur  within days.  a japanese government source said earlier on tuesday that japan had detected radio signals suggesting north korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals were not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity. south korea s yonhap news agency, citing a south korean government source, also reported that intelligence officials of the united states, south korea and japan had recently detected signs of a possible missile launch and have been on higher alert. the u.s. officials who spoke to reuters declined to say what type of missile they think north korea might test, but noted that pyongyang had been working to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states and had already tested inter continental ballistic missiles. other u.s. intelligence officials have noted that north korea has previously sent deliberately misleading signs of preparations for missile and nuclear tests. these have been in part to mask real preparations, and in part to test u.s. and allied intelligence on its activities. after firing missiles at a rate of about two or three a month since april, north korea paused its missile launches in late september, after it fired a missile that passed over japan s northern hokkaido island on sept. 15. last week, north korea denounced u.s. president donald trump s decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism, calling it a  serious provocation and violent infringement.  the designation allows the united states to impose more sanctions, though some experts said it risked inflaming tensions. trump has traded insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un and warned in his maiden speech to the united nations in september that the united states would have no choice but to  totally destroy  north korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. washington has said repeatedly that all options are on the table in dealing with north korea, including military ones, but that it prefers a peaceful solution by pyongyang agreeing to give up its nuclear and missile programs. to this end, trump has pursued a policy of encouraging countries around the world, including north korea s main ally and neighbor, china, to step up sanctions on pyongyang to persuade it to give up its weapons programs.  north korea has given no indication it is willing to re enter dialogue on those terms. south korean unification minister chow myoung gyon told reporters on tuesday there had been  noteworthy  movements from the north since its last missile launch, including engine tests, but there was no hard evidence of another nuclear or missile test.  north korea hasn t been engaging in new nuclear or missile tests but recently we ve seen them persistently testing engines and carrying out fuel tests,  he said.  but we need some more time to see whether these are directly related to missile and nuclear tests.  cho said north korea may announce the completion of its nuclear program within a year, as it is moving more quickly than expected in developing its arsenal. north korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea as a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, denies any such intention.

" a u.s. state department official said on tuesday that washington has no plans to change a cold war era law granting special immigration benefits to cubans, despite president barack obama’s moves toward normalized relations with the island country. “there continues to be a large migration flow out of cuba. it reflects the difficult economic and human rights conditions in the country,” francisco palmieri, principal deputy assistant secretary in state’s bureau of western hemisphere affairs, told a senate subcommittee hearing. “we have no plans to change the cuban adjustment act at this time,” palmieri said. the cuban adjustment act provides cubans with benefits granted to migrants from no other country. once they enter the united states and ask for asylum, virtually all are granted the right to stay, can apply for work permits and, later, green cards, which convey lawful permanent residency. some u.s. lawmakers have been demanding a fresh look at cuban immigration policy since the surprise december 2014 announcement from obama and cuban president raul castro that the two countries would move toward ending decades of estrangement. they argue that most of the cubans coming to the united states are coming for economic reasons and are not refugees from its communist government. fear of an end to their benefits has fueled a surge in departures from cuba, many via third countries, which has left large groups of cubans stranded in central america.  earlier this year, thousands were airlifted from panama and costa rica to northern mexico, where they crossed the border into the united states. senator marco rubio, the subcommittee chairman, asked palmieri about reports that panama might be planning to send more cuban migrants north. “we have not told them not to do their airlift,” palmieri said.

" yahoo inc’s shares fell as much as 3.8 percent on thursday, a day after the company said that more than 1 billion user accounts were compromised in a security breach in august 2013. the number of users affected by the breach, the largest in history, was double the number implicated in a prior 2014 breach that yahoo had disclosed in september. verizon, which has agreed to buy yahoo’s core internet business for $4.83 billion, had said at the time that it might withdraw from the deal. the no. 1 u.s. wireless carrier said on wednesday that it would review the impact of the latest development. “the prior breaches were not seen to have an effect on the verizon deal, so i would say that this is not going to have an effect either because its just something that is understood, it has to be addressed,” tigress financial partner analyst ivan feinseth said. up to wednesday’s close, yahoo’s stock had fallen more than 7 percent since the first breach was announced in september.

" president donald trump on monday accused the news media of ignoring attacks by islamist militants in europe. trump, who has made defeating islamic state a core goal of his presidency, did not specify which attacks were going unreported, which news media organizations were ignoring them, or offer any details to support his claims. “all over europe, it’s happening. it’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported,” he told a group of about 300 u.s. troops at macdill air force base in florida. “and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. they have their reasons, and you understand that,” he added, without saying what those reasons were. the white house later released a list of 78 attacks around the world from september 2014 to december 2016. “networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,” a white house official said. “this cannot be allowed to become the ‘new normal.’”it was trump’s latest salvo against the news media, a favorite target for derision that he says broadly underestimated his chances during the presidential campaign. he has kept up the attacks since his jan. 20 inauguration. trump at one point cited attacks in the french cities of paris and nice, which were widely covered. more than 230 people have died in france alone in the past two years at the hands of attackers allied to islamic state. al tompkins at the poynter institute, a florida based journalism school, dismissed trump’s criticism. “to suggest that journalists have some reason not to report isis attacks is just outlandish,” tompkins said, using an acronym for islamic state.

" the united nations must take over responsibility for investigating rights violations in yemen s civil war as the country s government is not up to the job, the global body s human rights office said.  in a report published on tuesday, the office challenged the u.n. human rights council, which meets this month, to agree to look into atrocities committed during what it called an  entirely man made catastrophe . the 47 country council has shied away from that task for two years, leaving the job to yemen s national commission, which reports to president abd rabbu mansour hadi. he is backed by a saudi led coalition that is one of the combatants.  i ...join you in asking why the members of the human rights council are not taking their responsibility and their membership to this body seriously,  the office s head of middle east and north africa, mohammad ali alnsour, told a news conference. yemen is mired in a war that has killed at least 10,000 people over the past two and a half years, according to u.n. figures. widespread hunger and internal displacement and an unprecedented cholera epidemic have led aid agencies to describe it as one of the world s worst humanitarian disasters. alnsour said this was the third time the council was being asked to set up an investigation.   that would really put pressure on the conflicting parties to adhere to the rules and the obligations under humanitarian law,  he said. the u.n. report said yemen s national commission was detrimentally affected by  political constraints .  the perceived partiality of the national commission and its limited access have prevented it from executing its mandate comprehensively,  it said.  in addition... (it) appears to be lacking any instrument, or mandate, that would enable it to channel its findings into a credible accountability mechanism.  the head of the u.n. world food programme told reuters on monday that saudi arabia should fund the entire humanitarian aid budget for yemen, or stop the war, or both   unusually direct criticism of a major u.n. donor. the u.n. report said at least 5,144 civilians were documented as being killed between march 2015 and aug. 30, 2017, with the saudi led coalition responsible for more than half. its air strikes were the leading cause of civilian and child casualties, the report said.  it also blamed the coalition for stoking a food crisis that has left 7.3 million on the brink of famine.

" chinese president xi jinping replied to north korean leader kim jong un s congratulatory message on china s communist party congress, saying he hopes to promote ties between the two countries, north korea s state news agency said on thursday. the friendly exchange is relatively routine, but it comes as china has come under intense pressure from the united states to do more to rein in the north s missile and nuclear tests, which have raised tensions globally. china has been increasingly frustrated over ally north korea s weapons tests in defiance of u.n. resolutions, repeatedly calling for restraint and urging all sides to speak and act carefully. xi s message comes days before u.s. president donald trump makes his first official visit to asia, with north korea high on the agenda. it follows tuesday s unexpected agreement between seoul and beijing to move beyond a year long dispute over the deployment of a u.s. anti missile system in south korea.  i wish that under the new situation, the chinese side would make efforts with the dprk side to promote relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development and thus make a positive contribution to ... defending regional peace and stability and common prosperity,  xi wrote in the message dated nov. 1, according to the north s official news agency kcna. dprk stands for the democratic people s republic of korea, north korea s official name. chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying did not give details of the message from xi to kim but confirmed it had been sent to express thanks for kim s congratulatory messages. many countries had sent messages to china over the congress and, to be polite, china had written back to say thank you to them, she added.  i believe this is in the interests of both sides and has important meaning for resolving the present problem we are facing and maintaining regional peace and stability,  hua told a daily news briefing in beijing. the message had yet to be carried by chinese state media as of thursday afternoon. china and north korea often exchange diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters, although personal messages between the leaders tend to be few. zhao tong, a north korea expert at the carnegie tsinghua center in beijing, said the exchange of messages appeared  totally routine , while noting that kim s congratulatory message was shorter than one sent after the previous communist party congress five years ago, when xi first came to power. after a flurry of activity including a sixth nuclear test on sept. 3, pyongyang did not disrupt last month s party congress with another test as some analysts had expected. it has not tested a missile since launching one over japan on sept. 15, the longest such lull this year. but zhao said this was likely due to  technical reasons rather than political reasons .  there are no signs that they are going to give up on additional missile or nuclear tests,  he said. nam seong wook, a professor of north korea studies at korea university in seoul, said xi s reply to kim could be interpreted as  china s strategic ambition to embrace both north korea and south korea  ahead of trump s visits to south korea and china.  xi has previously sent messages to kim, most recently last year when xi expressed his congratulations for a party congress in north korea. neither leader has visited the other s country since assuming power. kim sent a congratulatory message to xi last week at the end of china s communist party congress, wishing him  great success  as head of the nation.

" the u.n. migration agency called on social media giants on friday to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure west african migrants to libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. the smugglers often use facebook to reach would be migrants with false promises of jobs in europe, international organization for migration (iom) spokesman leonard doyle said. when migrants are tortured, video is also sometimes sent back to their families over whatsapp, as a means of extortion, he said.  we really ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture,  doyle told a geneva news briefing. there were no immediate replies from facebook or whatsapp to requests by reuters for comment. hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to cross the mediterranean to europe since 2014 and 3,091 have died en route this year alone, many after passing through libya. this year, the number of migrants entering europe is 165,000, about 100,000 fewer than all of last year, but the influx has presented a political problem for european countries. iom has been in discussions with social media providers about its concerns, doyle said, adding:  and so far to very little effect. what they say is  please tell us the pages and we will shut them down .  it is not our job to police facebook s pages. facebook should police its own pages,  he said. africa represents a big and expanding market for social media but many people are unemployed and vulnerable, he said.  facebook is pushing out, seeking market share across west africa and pushing out so called free basics, which allows ... a  dumb phone  to get access to facebook. so you are one click from the smuggler, one click from the lies,  he said. social media companies are  giving a turbo charged communications channel to criminals, to smugglers, to traffickers, to exploiters , he added. images broadcast by cnn last month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by libyan traffickers. this sparked anger in europe and africa and highlighted the risks migrants face. doyle called for social media companies to invest in civic minded media outreach and noted that on google, pop up windows appear if a user is looking at pornography images, to warn of danger or criminality. the iom has helped 13,000 migrants to return voluntarily to nigeria, guinea and other countries from libya this year. it  provides them with transport and pocket money and documents their often harrowing testimonies.  doyle said it was currently repatriating 4,000 migrants to niger. switzerland said on friday it was willing to take in up to 80 refugees in libya in need of protection, among 5,000 whom the un refugee agency says are in a precarious position.

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s plan to rapidly deport 2 to 3 million illegal immigrants with criminal records would further tax a system already stretched to its limits, current and former u.s. immigration officials say. immigration courts, which issue deportation orders, set bond and grant or deny asylum, currently have a backlog of more than 500,000 cases.  boosting staff could help address the problem but that could prove difficult. officials at the departments of justice and homeland security say they have had trouble quickly finding and vetting enough qualified candidates to fill all the positions for judges and immigration agents that congress has authorized.  the executive office of immigration review, which adjudicates immigration cases, has so far been able to fill only 294 judge positions out of the 374 congress has authorized because the process is slow by necessity. candidates for the job “face a rigorous screening process comparable to that of the appointment of a u.s. attorney,” said spokeswoman kathryn mattingly.  trump said last week after his election victory that once he takes office he will move to deport or incarcerate up to 3 million illegal immigrants who have criminal records.     at u.s. immigration and customs enforcement, a force of 6,200 agents responsible for arresting and deporting criminal migrants is already spread thin. while some agents could be redeployed to other areas, more agents would likely need to be hired if deportations were sharply escalated, said an immigration and customs enforcement official who asked not to named. the agency would probably need to add detention space as well, the official added.  more apprehensions of migrants could also strain the border patrol, which has struggled to fill open positions. congress has mandated a force of more than 21,000 border agents, but it currently stands at just over 19,000. former u.s. border patrol chief mike fisher said the agency ran into problems a decade ago after congress asked it to double the number of border patrol agents from 6,000 to 12,000 between 2004 and 2006. the push to hire quickly helped fuel corruption, a march 2016 report by the department of homeland security’s independent advisory council found.   the report concluded that the rapid hiring was exploited by mexican drug gangs, which sent in cartel friendly applicants for the patrol jobs. once hired, they then facilitated drug smuggling across the u.s. mexico border. the agency began using polygraph tests in 2010 to weed out applicants with criminal histories or ties to cartels. fisher said the testing made it harder to find qualified candidates, estimating that by the time he left in 2015, the border patrol made one hire out of every 100 applicants. “i can’t imagine if they said ‘double it’ now,” fisher said.  trump could try to change laws and procedures to expedite deportation processes, which could reduce the need for additional personnel.  on friday, trump tapped republican senator jeff sessions to be attorney general. sessions has supported trump’s plan to build a wall on the u.s. border with mexico and undo obama’s executive actions on immigration.  during president barack obama’s time in office, the united states has deported about 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any other president.

" the u.s. senate voted on wednesday to confirm the head of the justice department’s antitrust division, which will decide the fate of deals like at&t inc’s proposed purchase of time warner inc and the merger of bayer ag and monsanto co. the senate voted 73 to 21 to confirm delrahim. the senate also confirmed heath tarbert, by a vote of 87 to 8, to be an assistant secretary of the treasury. he is expected to oversee the inter agency committee on foreign investment in the united states, which assesses proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security.  tarbert, now at the law firm allen & overy llp, will take the reins of cfius at a time when the inter agency panel has balked at approving deals involving chinese buyers in areas as disparate as semiconductors, insurance and aluminum. the confirmations mean that the trump administration, after eight months, will finally have two of the top people in place who decide if mergers may go forward. their first decisions will give investors a framework to use to decide which deals to push.  as head of the antitrust division, delrahim will oversee a department that decides whether to allow multibillion dollar corporate mergers and acquisitions and also whether to seek jail terms for executives guilty of price fixing.  delrahim is currently deputy assistant to the president. as a candidate, president donald trump pledged to stop the at&t purchase of time warner. he has not repeated that since becoming president. delrahim said in may that he would decline to discuss antitrust matters with the white house. “the independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence,” he said. “they will be free if i am fortunate enough to be confirmed.” trump has three other major antitrust positions to fill. the federal trade commission, which should have five people, needs a permanent chairman and two commissioners, one republican and one who is either a democrat or an independent. antitrust experts who have followed delrahim’s career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss, hewitt pate, who headed the division from 2003 to 2005. under pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop us airways from merging with united airlines and blocked a deal to combine directv and echostar corp.

" sat in his hillside grocery shop in a bangladesh refugee camp, rohingya muslim momtaz ul hoque takes a break to listen to an audio recording on his mobile phone, while children and passers by gather round to hear the latest news from myanmar.  i listen because i get some information on my motherland,  said hoque, 30, as he plays a message on whatsapp explaining the myanmar government s proposals for repatriating refugees. hoque has been in bangladesh since an earlier bout of violence in myanmar s rakhine state in 1992, but the number of refugees in the camps has swelled dramatically to more than 800,000 in recent weeks, after a massive myanmar military operation sent around 600,000 people fleeing across the border. tens of thousands of exhausted refugees have arrived with little more than a sack of rice, a few pots and pans and a mobile phone powered by a cheap solar battery, and many are desperate for news of what is going on back home.   with few news sources in their own language and low levels of literacy, audio and video messages distributed on apps such as whatsapp, facebook and youtube have become a community radio of sorts for the muslim minority. dozens of whatsapp groups have sprung up to fill the information gap. their offerings range from grainy footage of violence, to listings of the names and numbers of people missing in the chaos of the exodus, or even an explainer from educated rohingya on how to adjust to life in the camps. at a shop selling cold drinks in the leda refugee camp, two men played  whatsapp news  through a loudspeaker.  out of breath, a man narrated a scene purportedly from a village in myanmar s buthidaung region, according to mohammed zubair, a refugee who translated the broadcasts for reuters.  they are surrounding the village. we are under attack from the military and the mogs...some people are seriously injured,  zubair translates the speaker as saying, using a derogatory term common in bangladesh to refer to ethnic rakhine buddhists.  i trust it 100 percent,  zubair said of the information. reuters was not able to verify the account. the whatsapp groups tend to have hundreds of members, meaning that the spread of information depends on people passing on the news. many of the listeners do not know who is sending the message or the trustworthiness of the broadcaster. some said outdated or inaccurate reports were common.  in some cases, we got audio messages of villages burning in myanmar, and when we contact people in those villages, there s nothing,  said one refugee inside a tea shop in bangladesh skutupalong camp. other refugees said videos of violence claimed to have been filmed in villages in myanmar turned out to be footage from other countries. many also worry that the unregulated nature of whatsapp groups increases opportunities for voices keen to push an agenda rather than share facts. rohingya rebel group the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa)   whose aug. 25 attacks on security forces triggered the latest crisis   and its followers have been among the most active adopters of whatsapp to spread their message. audio messages urging support, updates on the latest military movements and official press releases dominate some groups. several refugees in bangladesh said they had no idea if the messages, often posted by people with phone numbers registered in the middle east or other parts of asia, were actually from arsa members. refugees also worry that bangladeshi security forces want to monitor the broadcasts, and are looking in the camps for arsa supporters. at the tea shop in kutupalong camp, refugees have stopped listening to the broadcasts on loudspeakers during daylight hours, preferring to gather clandestinely at night instead.     still, many rohingyas say social media platforms  play a crucial role in keeping spirits up among the community.  the rohingya people are not organized,  said hoque, the grocer.  they cannot take out their frustration any other way, so this is a way of protesting.

" a u.s. senate committee approved legislation on thursday that would broaden sanctions on north korea over its nuclear program, human rights record and cyber activities, the latest bid by u.s. lawmakers to crack down on pyongyang after its fourth nuclear test. the senate foreign relations committee passed the measure by unanimous voice vote and members said they expected it would be approved by the full senate within weeks, and signed into law by president barack obama. u.s. lawmakers have been clamoring for a clampdown on north korea since pyongyang earlier this month tested a nuclear device which it said was a hydrogen bomb. the u.n. security council is also discussing more action against the country, although it is not clear what would be supported by china, north korea’s lone major ally and main business partner. the senate bill would sanction anyone who engages in, facilitates or contributes to north korea’s proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms related materials, luxury goods, human rights abuses, activities undermining cyber security and the provision of metals or coal for use in such activities. penalties include the seizure of assets, visa bans and denial of government contracts. committee members said they wanted to make washington’s resolve clear not just to pyongyang, but to other governments. they said they expected the house of representatives would back the senate legislation. “we must also send a strong message to china,” said republican senator cory gardner, chairman of the panel’s asia subcommittee and co author of the legislation. an obama administration official said the administration does not oppose the legislation, saying it is deeply concerned about north korea’s recent actions and sees the most recent test as a “serious setback.” u.s. officials told reuters on thursday the united states had seen increased activity around a north korean site suggesting preparations for a possible space launch in the near future, raising concerns that the country was seeking to develop an inter continental ballistic missile. north korea conducted a nuclear test on jan. 6 that it said was the explosion of a hydrogen bomb, although the united states and other governments and experts voiced scepticism that it had made such a technological advance. the house passed its own, less extensive, bill to broaden sanctions on jan. 12 by a near unanimous 418 2 vote. the senate is due to begin considering the bill approved by the foreign relations committee during the week of feb. 8.

"wow peter schweizer, author of  the chilling  clinton cash  book better make sure he has bodyguards wherever he goes, because his book could be the reason for the  collapse of the clinton crime

viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called  clinton cash: the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich,  these people said.the account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.starting in february and continuing today, investigators from the federal bureau of investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. at the center of the tension stood the u.s. attorney for brooklyn, robert capers, who some at the fbi came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. through a spokeswoman, mr. capers declined to comment.the roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether clinton foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the state department under hillary clinton. senior officials in the justice department and the fbi

furor surrounding fbi director james comey s disclosure to congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed fbi investigation of mrs. clinton s email arrangement while she was secretary of state.on wednesday, president barack obama took the unusual step of criticizing the fbi when asked about mr. comey s disclosure of the emails.amid the internal finger-pointing on the clinton foundation matter, some have blamed the fbi s no. 2 official, deputy director andrew mccabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. his defenders deny that, and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation.wsj   the political organization of virginia gov. terry mcauliffe, an influential democrat with longstanding ties to bill and hillary clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the federal bureau of investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into mrs. clinton s email use.campaign finance records show mr. mcauliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state senate campaign of dr. jill mccabe, who is married to andrew mccabe, now the deputy director of the fbi.the virginia democratic party, over which mr. mcauliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to dr. mccabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. that adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under mr. mcauliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. the figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds dr. mccabe raised in the effort.mr. mccabe s supervision of the clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and mr. mcauliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said.much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the clinton charity. the author of that book, peter schweizer a former speechwriting consultant for president george w. bush was interviewed multiple times by fbi agents, people familiar with the matter said.the clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. the clinton foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.mr. schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe  patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions hillary clinton was making as secretary of state. as 2015 came to a close, the fbi and justice department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on clinton foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. in february, a meeting was held in washington among fbi officials, public-integrity prosecutors and leslie caldwell, the head of the justice department s criminal division. prosecutors from the eastern district of new york mr. capers  office didn t attend, these people said.the public-integrity prosecutors weren t impressed with the fbi presentation, people familiar with the discussion said.  the message was,  we re done here,    a person familiar with the matter said.justice department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.following the february meeting, officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to  stand down,  a person familiar with the matter said.the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made, these people said. the agents listening to the recordings couldn t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.for entire story: wsj ",1

" republican lawmakers must deliver tax legislation to president donald trump’s desk before december or lose their chance to enact bold reforms capable of driving the u.s. economy, a leading republican conservative said on wednesday. representative mark meadows, chairman of the house freedom caucus, told conservative activists that the prospects for significant tax reform would diminish as lawmakers approach the start of the 2018 congressional election campaign in january.  he said lawmakers needed to introduce tax legislation in september, pass the measure through the house of representatives and senate and send it to trump’s desk by the nov. 23 u.s. thanksgiving holiday. “if it doesn’t get there by thanksgiving, guys, it isn’t going to happen,” meadows said.  the white house has said it expects the house to vote on a tax bill in october and the senate in november. trump’s fellow republicans control both chambers, analysts say the schedule could be too optimistic, because congress is due to spend much of september and possibly october on spending bills to keep the government open and a debt ceiling increase to avoid default on sovereign u.s. debt. lawmakers could be more likely to approve tax legislation in early 2018, the analysts say. but meadows rejected that possibility. “the minute we go past january, everybody starts saying: ‘we can’t do anything too bold,’” he said.  republicans plan to move tax legislation forward through a procedure known as reconciliation, which would allow the senate to pass a bill with a simple majority. republicans control the chamber by a 52 48 margin and would otherwise need 60 votes. the failure of senate republicans to find a simple majority for healthcare legislation last week has led to calls for bipartisan tax reform.   white house budget director mick mulvaney shot down that idea earlier on wednesday.  “a tax bill looks a lot weaker, a lot less likely to get us to 3 percent economic growth, if we’ve got eight, 10, 12, 14 democrats on it,” he told fox news. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell rejected a democratic overture for broad bipartisanship on tuesday. on wednesday, he still hoped some democrats would back republican tax legislation. “there is a great deal of bipartisan consensus about what ails our tax code, and my hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle will join with us in a serious way,” mcconnell said on the senate floor.

" the u.s. congress will allow a deadline on reimposing sanctions on iran to pass this week, congressional and white house aides said on tuesday, leaving a pact between world powers and tehran intact at least temporarily. in october, trump declined to certify that iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among tehran, the united states and others in 2015. his decision triggered a 60 day window for congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on iran. congressional leaders have announced no plans to introduce a resolution to reimpose sanctions before wednesday’s deadline and aides say lawmakers will let the deadline pass without action. by doing that, congress passes the ball back to trump, who must decide in mid january if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on iran. trump’s failure to do so would blow apart the deal, a course opposed by european allies, russia and china, the other parties to the accord, under which iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear ambitions. iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb. it has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will “shred” the deal if washington pulls out.  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the administration was not asking for sanctions to be reimposed. “the administration continues to make encouraging progress with congress to fix the u.s.–iran deal and address long term proliferation issues,” she told a daily press briefing. efforts to find common ground with europe on the iran deal were complicated again last week, when trump announced washington would recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital, breaking with international consensus. trump has called the iran pact the “worst deal ever” and has threatened to pull the united states out of it.  his fellow republicans control both chambers of congress  but their senate majority is so small that they need some democratic support to advance most legislation. senate democrats, even those who opposed it two years ago, do not want to tear up the nuclear accord. republican senator bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, declined to say whether he thought trump would carry through on a threat to tear up the nuclear pact in january if congress does not pass legislation to further clamp down on iran. corker told reporters he and democratic senator ben cardin met national security adviser h.r. mcmaster last week to see “if there’s language that fits the bill here within congress but also ... keeps them (the europeans) at the table with us and not feeling like we’ve gone off in a different direction.” corker declined to elaborate on specifics of the discussions. trump threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement if lawmakers did not toughen it by amending the iran nuclear agreement review act, or inara, the u.s. law that opened the possibility of bringing sanctions back. cardin, the senior democrat on the senate foreign relations panel, has said he would not support changes to the nuclear pact that are not supported by europe. democrats also insist that while sanctions should be imposed over iran’s ballistic missiles program or human rights violations, they must be separate from the nuclear agreement.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump, a golf resort developer who has railed against mexico in the 2016 campaign, lost an important golf tournament to that country on wednesday when the pga tour said it would leave his trump doral course in miami. although the pga tour said it was not a political decision, trump said in a statement the move was akin to decisions by some u.s. companies to move jobs to mexico, which has been a refrain of his presidential campaign. “the pga tour has put profit ahead of thousands of american jobs, millions of dollars in revenue for local communities and charities and the enjoyment of hundreds of thousands of fans who make the tournament an annual tradition,” he said. “this decision only further embodies the very reason i am running for president of the united states.” the pga said the world golf championship event would move from trump national doral to a site in mexico city and be sponsored by the grupo salinas conglomerate. pga tour commissioner tim finchem said the move was necessary “once it became apparent that we would not be able to secure sponsorship at levels that would sustain the event and help it grow at trump national doral.” “from a golf standpoint, we have no issues with donald trump. from a political standpoint, we are neutral. the pga tour has never been involved or cares to be involved in presidential politics,” finchem told a news conference in dublin, ohio. cadillac has been the title sponsor for the event in recent years including this year’s tournament in march. cadillac representatives did not respond to a request for comment. trump’s son eric trump said cadillac had been willing to continue. “cadillac is ready, willing and able to continue as title sponsor for the tournament,” he told reuters. “and i also can say that cadillac is an amazing company and a longtime partner to the trump organization and we have an impeccable relationship.” the doral tournament is one of the biggest pro golf events of the year, drawing top golfers from around the world competing for a $6 million purse. the doral course has hosted a pga tournament since 1962. trump, whose golf empire includes 18 courses, purchased the golf resort in 2012 and led a $250 million renovation of its blue monster course where the pga tournament has been played. the news about doral surfaced on the same day that trump announced he would step away from the campaign trail later this month to travel to scotland for the reopening of the turnberry golf resort, which he bought in 2014.

" russian prime minister dmitry medvedev complained on friday that u.s. cruise missile strikes on a syrian airbase were one step away from clashing with the russian military. u.s. officials informed russian forces ahead of the strikes — intended to punish the syrian government for what they say was a chemical weapons attack earlier this week — and avoided hitting russian personnel. satellite imagery suggests the shayrat air base that was struck is home to russian special forces and military helicopters, part of the kremlin’s effort to help the syrian government fight islamic state and other militant groups. medvedev, writing on social media, said the u.s. strikes were illegal and had been “one step away from military clashes with russia.” ",0
" president elect donald trump laid out a u.s. military policy on tuesday that would avoid interventions in foreign conflicts and instead focus heavily on defeating the islamic state militancy. in the latest stop on a “thank you” tour of states critical to his nov. 8 election win, trump introduced his choice for defense secretary, general james mattis, to a large crowd in this city near the fort bragg military base, which has deployed soldiers to 90 countries around the world. “we will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn’t be involved with,” trump said. “instead, our focus must be on defeating terrorism and destroying isis, and we will.” trump’s rhetoric was similar to what he said during the election campaign when he railed against the war in iraq. in fayetteville, he vowed a strong rebuilding of the u.s. military, which he suggested has been stretched too thin. instead of investing in wars, he said, he would spend money to build up america’s aging roads, bridges and airports. even so, trump said he wants to boost spending on the military. to help pay for his buildup, trump pledged to seek congressional approval for lifting caps on defense spending that were part of “sequestration” legislation that imposed cut spending across the board. “we don’t want to have a depleted military because we’re all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldn’t be fighting in. it’s not going to be depleted any longer,” he said. trump said any nation that shares these goals will be considered a u.s. partner. “we don’t forget. we want to strengthen old friendships and seek out new friendships,” he said. he said the policy of “intervention and chaos” must come to an end. while u.s. armed forces are deployed in far flung places around the globe, they are only involved currently in active combat in the middle east, specifically iraq and syria for the most part. “we will build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention,” he said. “in short, we seek peace through strength.” trump described mattis as the right person for the job and urged congress to approve a waiver to let him take on the civilian position. under u.s. law a military leader must be retired for seven years before becoming eligible to become defense secretary. speaking to the crowed, mattis said, “i look forward to being the civilian leader as long as the congress gives me the waiver and the senate votes to consent.” “we’re going to get you that waiver,” trump said, returning to the microphone. “if you don’t get that waiver there are going to be a lot of angry people.” ",0
" the white house expects the u.s. congress to soon waive a rule known as “paygo” that could trigger deep spending cuts in areas such as medicare and agriculture in order to cover the costs of the recently passed tax overhaul, a white house official said on wednesday.  congress will likely waive the rule, which requires the senate to find offsets for the large tax cuts in the bill, through the spending resolution it must soon pass in order to keep the government open, the official added. the official said the internal revenue service, the country’s tax agency, can immediately begin implementing changes called for in the $1.5 trillion overhaul of the u.s. tax code and does not need to wait for president donald trump to sign the bill into law.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was endorsed  by the congressional black caucus on thursday, a much needed boost to her campaign as it competes for the important black voting bloc in south carolina’s primary this month. clinton and her husband, former president bill clinton, have built strong ties to the african american community over the past decades. several lawmakers cited clinton’s long history of not only working on issues important to black americans, but on getting democrats elected and advancing the party’s agenda.  “mrs clinton has demonstrated her leadership skills. she has labored in various capacities all of her adult life and now she is ready to serve our country by occupying the highest office in our country,” said u.s. representative g.k. butterfield. the group’s backing will be important as clinton seeks to recover from tuesday’s stinging loss to u.s. senator bernie sanders in the new hampshire primary. black voters make up a large bloc in the democratic primary in south carolina and will be increasingly significant to the democrats as the presidential contest moves from iowa and new hampshire to more demographically diverse states. the congressional black caucus political action committee planned to send a dozen members to south carolina to campaign for clinton over the weekend in advance of the state’s feb. 27 democratic primary. sanders, fresh off his victory in new hampshire, had breakfast on wednesday with one of america’s most prominent civil rights activists, rev. al sharpton, recognizing the need to broaden his base to mount a long term challenge to clinton. u.s. representative james clyburn, an influential african american from south carolina, declined to make a personal endorsement before the caucus announcement in washington.  appearing on cnn thursday morning, clyburn praised sanders’ voting record and had no criticism of the u.s. senator from vermont.  but his comments suggested he was leaning toward clinton, whom he credited with significant contributions to issues important to black americans, particularly universal access to health care and children’s issues. butterfield was more pointed in alluding to sanders, who promises universal health care and free college tuition. “we need a president who doesn’t simply campaign and just promise wonderful things but things that are politically impossible to achieve,” he said at the caucus announcement.

" egyptian police arrested seven people on monday after they were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert, security sources said, in a rare public show of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative muslim country. security sources said the seven were arrested for  promoting sexual deviancy,  a euphemism in egypt for homosexuality, after they were seen on camera raising the rainbow flag at a mashrou  leila concert, a popular lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay. egyptian public prosecutor nabil sadek ordered the state security prosecution to immediately investigate the incident, state news agency mena reported. the public prosecutor has not yet announced a decision on whether formal charges will be filed and a case brought to court. although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. the largest crackdown on homosexuals in egypt took place in 2001, when police raided a floating disco called the queen boat. fifty two men were tried in the case, which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and western governments.

" hurricane maria has devastated the u.s. territory of puerto rico, another blow to its already precarious economic situation. puerto rico s government owes $72 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. in may, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history. the following are responses from multinational companies on how they are dealing with the aftermath of maria: wal mart stores inc phillip keene, wal mart s director of corporate communications, said,  like many businesses, we are working to assess any damage to our facilities as we are safely able to access them and working to connect with our associates to assess what their needs are so we can support as appropriate. we are planning to open facilities very thoughtfully, starting with limited hours at our sam s club near san juan, perhaps as soon as sunday. one of our amigo stores has already reopened under limited hours on the south side of san juan as of this morning.  walmart operates 48 retail facilities, a distribution center and a satellite headquarters in puerto rico, supported by more than 14,700 associates across the island. at this time, we are trying to best understand the impacts of hurricane maria to puerto rico, but it s been a slow process due to widespread power outages and communication issues. we have activated the emergency operations center (eoc) at the walmart home office in bentonville, arkansas, to support our associates in puerto rico. the eoc is walmart s centralized platform for crisis coordination. in the eoc, we work directly with logistics, store operations and other teams within the business to ensure we re aligned on our support plans.  we have been in contact with leaders on the island and continue to be in regular contact with fema and the american red cross. our first priority is, and continues to be, the safety of our associates   taking care of them and their families. we are working rapidly to account for our associates, through store and hr leadership as well as social media, local radio and other channels. these efforts will continue.   although our normal assessment process has been impeded a bit by road conditions and flooding, we are currently working to identify the status of our facilities on the island. our merchandising, replenishment, supply chain and logistics teams are working to ensure we have critical supplies and product headed to the island via shipping vessels that are slated to depart as soon as friday (sept. 22). this is in addition to the shipment of water that was sent toward the island earlier this week, which is currently staged at sea awaiting clearance to safely enter port. we will continue to assess the right flow and mix of merchandise and supplies to send to puerto rico in the coming days and weeks.   tammy hull, communications manager at eli lilly, said:  lilly has two manufacturing sites in puerto rico as well as an affiliate office and sales team. safety of our employees is our primary concern. the small team of employees who stayed onsite during the storm are safe. we are still accounting for all employees, which is a slow process due to power and communications loss on the island. we are currently assessing our facilities to determine if any damage occurred. lilly follows emergency procedures that enable us to maintain adequate inventory at our manufacturing sites around the world to ensure a reliable supply of medicine for patients.   kristen davis, senior manager of corporate communications at amgen, said:  our first priority is the safety of our colleagues and their families. the vast majority of staff at our amgen manufacturing limited (aml) site in juncos were sent home prior to maria making landfall, with only a limited number of colleagues remaining on site to monitor operations. at the moment, we are still working to determine the safety of our people and are hopeful that all will be well. at the same time, we are executing on a comprehensive and well rehearsed business continuity plan for the site itself. based on what we know at the moment, we are confident there will be no product supply disruptions for patients around the world. of course, we will work diligently to ensure drug supply for patients in puerto rico and to return our operations in puerto rico to normal as quickly as possible.  michele meixell, head of external communications and affairs at astrazeneca, said:  given the early nature of the disaster, we are still in the process of gathering more information, but i can tell you what we know so far. our puerto rico employee base consists of approximately 250 colleagues. this represents both field based employees as well as those working in our manufacturing facility located in canovanas.   right now our number one priority remains the safety and health of our employees and their families. at this point, it s still early to understand the full impact to our site, but we have started the process to assess our facility. the site does have backup power capabilities and we have a storm crew in limited operation right now until employees are able to safely return to work. in advance of the storm, the facility took appropriate precautions and we have business continuity plans in place to ensure our medicines continue in production.   we do not anticipate interruption in supply at this time. i also want to point out that while our puerto rico site is of critical importance to our organization, we have manufacturing facilities all over the globe producing medicines, so in terms of overall business impact, this is important to clarify.  regarding the safety of our employees, all non essential employees had been sent home prior to the storm earlier this week. this is a critical time for our employees to be safe and with their families and we will stay in touch with them in various ways that work best for them in this time of need. we stand behind those impacted by hurricane maria and astrazeneca is committed to helping the people and employees affected by all of these recent natural disasters. we will continue to assess the needs of both our employees and those impacted by the storm and once we have more clarity on their needs, provide support and aid however we can.      pfizer spokeswoman joan campion said,  we re continuing to assess the situation in puerto rico.

" twitter s ban on adverts from russian media was motivated by washington s  deep prejudices  against moscow and was setting a worrying precedent for the company to treat its clients unequally, the kremlin said on friday. twitter inc on thursday accused russian media outlets russia today (rt) and sputnik of interfering in the 2016 u.s. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism in the united states that the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  we regret this. we regret that, first and foremost, this company (twitter) is most probably falling victim to deep prejudices about our mass media,  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters.  we also regret that the company is actually creating a precedent of unequal treatment of its clients which ... is likely to alarm and worry other users of this network.  in april, reuters reported that rt and sputnik were part of a plan by russian president vladimir putin to swing the u.s. presidential election to donald trump and undermine voters  faith in the american electoral system, according to three current and four former u.s. officials. the kremlin has strongly denied u.s. accusations of  meddling in the polls.  we still hope that in the end the company will deem it necessary to analyze this situation in detail and in the end will come to a conclusion that the work of free mass media, which rt and sputnik are certainly part of, should in no way be qualified as meddling in the electoral process of the u.s.a. or any other country,  peskov said. he also said that possible new u.s. sanctions against russia were a cause for concern and a reflection of washington s  unfriendly and even hostile attitude towards our country . the u.s. state department said on thursday it had belatedly begun informing congress and others about groups associated with the russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on russia.

" the leader of one of italy s biggest political parties, the northern league, criticized magistrates on thursday after the genoa court froze several of the bloc s bank accounts. matteo salvini, speaking to reporters at the lower house of parliament, said five of the party s bank accounts were frozen on thursday, following a july conviction of party founder umberto bossi and others of illegal use of party funds. the court in genoa in northern italy has accepted a request by prosecutors in the fraud case to preventively freeze the accounts, a source close to the matter told reuters.  the magistrates are trying to outlaw a political party,  salvini said.  they re trying to stop the advance of the league, which has reached a historic high.  salvini said he would meet with the party s lawyers on friday to discuss how to fight the seizure. bossi is no longer in frontline politics, but he remains an influential figure in the party. in july, the genoa court said bossi had used party funds to pay for family expenses. the ruling is being appealed and is not definitive. the league would win 15 percent of the vote if an election were held now, recent polls show, which is about three times higher than it faired in the 2014 european elections.  that would make it the country s third most popular party, and a national vote is due early next year. as hundreds of thousands of boat migrants have arrived in italy in the past three years, the opposition northern league has attacked the government s and the european union s handling of the immigration crisis.  at the same time, salvini has tried to broaden the appeal of the party, which was founded to protest rome s funneling of taxpayer money to the under developed south.

" the senate on thursday moved closer to approving president donald trump’s pick to head the environmental protection agency even as nearly 800 former officials urged the chamber to reject the nominee, who sued the agency more than a dozen times as attorney general of oil producing oklahoma.  the 773 former officials signed a letter sent to the senate  that said pruitt’s record and public statements suggest he does not agree with the underlying principles of u.s. environmental laws. pruitt has also cast doubts on the science of climate change. “mr. pruitt has shown no interest in enforcing those laws, a critically important function for epa,” the letter said.  a spokesman for pruitt did not immediate respond to a request for comment. the senate advanced pruitt’s nomination on thursday, clearing the way for a final vote, expected on friday.   republican senator susan collins came out against pruitt on wednesday, saying she had doubts about whether he would fully support the epa’s mission to protect human health and the environment. but pruitt only needs a simple majority for approval, so unless collins is joined by more republicans, who control the senate 52 to 48, his nomination is likely to succeed. making pruitt’s chances even likelier, senator heidi heitkamp, a democrat, said she would cast her for vote for him, even though she had “concerns” about his commitment to renewable power and to cut emissions blamed for climate change.    joseph santarella, an epa enforcement lawyer under former republican and democratic administrations, who signed the letter protesting pruitt, said his lawsuits against the agency demonstrated he had “a fundamental lack of understanding and respect for the vital role that epa plays in ensuring clean air and water for every american.”  senator john barrasso, a republican from coal producing wyoming and head of the senate energy committee, said pruitt had “led the charge to rein in big government and washington overreach.” the public could soon learn more about pruitt’s communications with energy companies while he was suing the epa. oklahoma county district court judge aletia timmons ruled that pruitt will have to turn over 3,000 emails between his office and energy companies to her by tuesday. timmons will review the emails before deciding which of them to release. a watchdog group, the center for media and democracy, has sought the release of the documents since january 2015.

" britain won a vote of confidence from its economically important life sciences sector on wednesday as several major drug companies committed to invest in the country under the government s industrial strategy plans after brexit. the move is welcome news for prime minister theresa may, who has struggled to win over large sections of industry as britain prepares to leave the european union. thanks to the strength of uk universities and the presence of two major pharmaceuticals companies in glaxosmithkline and astrazeneca, the drugs industry has been a bright spot in the british economy for many years.  but the highly regulated sector faces potential obstacles to trade as a result of brexit unless london and brussels manage to align regulatory regimes for medicines. in a bid to soften the blow, the government has backed a report by immunologist and geneticist john bell designed to boost the pharmaceutical sector via fresh public private collaborations. that has paved the way for the life sciences sector deal, which will see gsk invest 40 million pounds ($54 million) of new money in genomic research, including a plan to sequence dna from all 500,000 volunteer participants enrolled in uk biobank, the world s most detailed biomedical database. gsk s head of research patrick vallance said the deal showed britain remained an attractive place for drug discovery, but he cautioned:  the uk needs to recognize going forward that science is an international endeavor, not a parochial endeavor.  other investments by pharma companies include plans by johnson & johnson and the medicines co to work on new clinical trials and genetic research by astrazeneca. u.s. drugmaker merck & co had already announced plans to expand uk research operations under the deal last week. in all, the government said the deal brought together existing and future commitments by 25 global organizations. other companies in discussions with the government about investments include philips, roche diagnostics, siemens, ge healthcare and toshiba medical systems. as a key part of the deal, the government said it was committed to increasing investment in r&d to 2.4 percent of gdp by 2027 and 3 percent over the longer term.

" troops and attack helicopters opened fire on protesters at the height of separatist rallies in english speaking areas of cameroon over the weekend, killing and wounding people, witnesses and rights groups said. the army dismissed the reports from sources in five towns as  completely false  and said helicopters had only been used for surveillance. any use of air attacks would mark a major escalation in a government crackdown on separatist protests that have been rumbling in anglophone districts of the central african oil producer for almost a year. thousands took to the streets in towns across the northwest and southwest regions on sunday, oct. 1, calling for independence from the country s french speaking majority.  rights groups said they started to collect reports on ensuing violence in the areas bordering nigeria as the week progressed. eight people in the towns of bamenda, buea, ndu, tombel and kumbo told reuters that police and soldiers moved in to stop the protests and in some areas, low flying attack helicopters fired tear gas and live rounds on the crowds. etienne ndage, a 31 year old journalist for savannah frontier radio in the northwest tea plantation town of ndu said he saw helicopters firing at around 1 pm local time, killing two protesters as a 1,000 strong march gained momentum.   they were firing like in a war film,  he told reuters. hilary manjong, private secretary to a local member of parliament in ndu, said witnesses had shared similar accounts with him.  army spokesman didier badjeck dismissed the accounts.  reports that the helicopters fired on protestors is completely false. the helicopters were only conducting surveillance,  he said. the government earlier this week said about 10 people had died on sunday including five in a prison fire that may not have been linked to the protests. the governor of southwest region, bernard okalia bilai, told the cameroon tribune newspaper in an article published on tuesday that protesters had ambushed soldiers in kumba, forcing them to open fire in self defense. amnesty international told reuters on thursday that more than 20 people were killed between oct. 1 and 2.   demonstrations began nearly a year ago when anglophone lawyers and teachers protested against having to work in french, saying it showed the wider marginalization of the english speaking minority.  the protests gained support and have increasingly called for cameroon s five million english speakers to get their own country. the rallies have also have become a lightning rod for opposition to president paul biya s 35 year rule. campaigners called more protests on sunday, the anniversary of anglophone cameroon s independence from britain. in the southwest town of tombel, a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity told reuters that a military helicopter came so low over the town center that the wind gusts threw a man off his motorbike.  first the helicopter fired teargas to disperse the crowd, then it opened fire, the resident said.  normally they fire rubber bullets, but i could tell from the sound that these were real,  they added.  outside buea, police on the ground and a helicopter opened fire on protestors who had run into the bush to bypass a military checkpoint, said louis anuchem, a 35 year old taxi driver from buea.   the helicopter came close to the ground,  he added.  we heard the gunshots and the bullets coming through the trees,  he told reuters. after the demonstrations police went door to door in some towns, rounding up young men and women, residents said.  soldiers came to our neighborhood and broke into homes and carried boys away,  said lanya joel, a 21 year old kumba resident.  i am scared and will be away until it s all over.  rights group the southern cameroon s public affairs committee said in a report that a 12 year old girl was shot by security forces from a helicopter in the town of kumbo. the bamenda provincial episcopal conference of anglophone christian bishops said in a statement this week that is was disturbed by reports that  some of our christians were ... arrested, some maimed, and some were simply shot to death, some from helicopters.  helene mekem said her son was shot dead by security forces outside his home in kumba on sunday, even though he was not involved in the protests.  they are killing the innocent ones,  she told reuters.

" jamie dimon, chief executive officer of jpmorgan chase & co, on wednesday said he expects to see a new u.s. president in 2021 and advised the democratic party to come up with a “pro free enterprise” agenda for jobs and economic growth instead. asked at a luncheon hosted by the economic club of chicago how many years republican president donald trump will be in office, dimon said, “if i had to bet, i’d bet three and half. but the democrats have to come up with a reasonable candidate ... or trump will win again.” dimon, who in the past has described himself as “barely” a democrat, has been going to washington more often since the 2016 elections to lobby lawmakers on issues including changes in corporate taxes, immigration policies and mortgage finance. in december, dimon became chairman of the business roundtable, an association of ceos who take their views to government policymakers. dimon, 61, touched on wide range of topics, from america’s political climate to racial discrimination to the effects of the u.k. leaving the european union. he also commented on foreign affairs, saying, for example, “we should never be rude to a neighbor like mexico” and cautioning that the political weakness of german chancellor angela merkel “is bad for all of us.” talks on forming a governing coalition including merkel’s christian democratic union collapsed earlier this week, casting doubt on her future after 12 years in power. dimon spoke for several minutes about discrimination over gender and race which he said is not acknowledged enough in the united states. “if you’re white, paint yourself black and walk down the street one day, and you’ll probably have a little more empathy for how some of these folks get treated,” dimon said. “we need to make a special effort because this is a special problem.” dimon gave his own bank a mixed review on diversity. his direct reports include people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (lgbt), and half are women as are 30 percent of the top 200 jpmorgan executives, he said. now in his 12th year as jpmorgan’s ceo, dimon also reflected a bit on his own role. “i basically love my job,” dimon said. “i mean, it’s tiring;  it’s exhausting. i have to go down to washington all the time and it’s a big pain in the ass, but i basically love my job.” ",0

" a group of elder republican statesmen, including three former cabinet members, said they will meet with white house officials on wednesday to propose a $40 per ton tax on carbon emissions to fend off global climate change. the proposal echoes past attempts by parts of the republican party to address climate change but could be a non starter. republican president donald trump has cast doubt on the existence of climate change and vowed during his campaign for the presidency to pull the united states out of a global pact to fight it. “mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore,” the group said in an opinion piece published by the new york times and the wall street journal late on tuesday. “now that the republican party controls the white house, both chambers of congress and a majority of state legislatures, it has the opportunity and responsibility to promote a climate plan that showcases the full power of enduring conservative convictions,” they said. an overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels is driving global climate change, triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. the carbon tax proposal was co authored by james baker, secretary of state during the administration of george h. w. bush; henry paulson, treasury secretary under george w. bush; george shultz, secretary of state under ronald reagan; and several others.  the group said in a press release they would meet with “senior white house officials in two separate meetings” on wednesday to present their proposal. their plan calls for a $40 per ton carbon tax that rises over time, in which all of the revenues are returned to americans in the form of quarterly dividends administered by the social security administration. the plan would also call for “significant regulatory rollback” of former democratic president barack obama’s climate initiatives, including the repeal of his clean power plan aimed at curbing carbon output from states. a white house official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the full plan is at www.clcouncil.org/ ",0
" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on thursday there could be an opportunity for talks between north korea and the united states if pyongyang stopped testing and developing its nuclear and missile programs.  so long as they stop testing, stop developing, they don t export their weapons, there would be opportunity for talks,  mattis told reporters on a military plane. while washington has said that all options, including military, are on the table in dealing with north korea, it has stressed its preference is for a diplomatic solution. visiting seoul last week, u.s. president donald trump warned north korea he was prepared to use the full range of american military power to stop any attack, but also urged pyongyang to  make a deal.   trump, who had previously called negotiations with north korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks. pyongyang has made clear it has little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. the last north korean missile test was carried out almost two months ago, but u.s. officials say they have seen no signs that pyongyang has stopped development. mattis said the u.s. military was closely watching why there had been no missile launches recently, but declined to give potential reasons for it.  there are concerns in south korea that any potential u.s. strikes against north korea s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating north korean retaliation against south korea. earlier this week, a senior south korean official said trump should  under no circumstances  take military action against north korea without the consent of the government in seoul. in colorado, mattis will visit the u.s. northern command and the north american aerospace defense command (norad), which are responsible for homeland defense, including tracking and potentially intercepting north korean missiles.

" china and the philippines have agreed to avoid force to resolve their differences over the south china sea, according to a joint statement issued on thursday by china at the end of a visit to manila by chinese premier li keqiang. china and the philippines have long sparred over the south china sea, but relations have improved considerably under philippine president rodrigo duterte. malaysia, taiwan, brunei, vietnam and the philippines claim some or all of the south china sea and its myriad shoals, reefs and islands. china claims most of the waterway and has been aggressively building and militarizing artificial islands. the joint statement, carried by china s official xinhua news agency, said china and the philippines reaffirmed the importance of peace in the south china sea and of freedom of navigation and overflight. there should be no violence or threats of violence and the dispute should be resolved via talks between the  relevant sovereign countries , it added.   both sides believe that the maritime dispute is not the full sum of the china philippines relationship,  the statement said. in a separate statement summing up discussions at the association of southeast asian nations summit, duterte took note of the  improving relations between asean and china  in the south china sea.  in view of this positive momentum, we looked forward to the announcement of the start of substantive negotiations on the code of conduct (coc) with china  he said, hopefully in early 2018 in vietnam, where the two sides will meet at the earliest. asean and china have been discussing a set of rules on how to behave in the disputed waters to avoid accidents and raising tension.  duterte said the two sides also had successfully tested the hotline among foreign ministries on how to manage maritime emergencies.  in our view, these are practical measures that could reduce tensions, and the risks of accidents, misunderstandings and miscalculation,  he said.

" the european union, united nations and african union have agreed to an emergency plan to dismantle people smuggling networks and repatriate stranded migrants, in an effort to ease a human rights disaster in libya, officials said.  images broadcast by cnn earlier this month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by libyan traffickers, sparking outrage in europe and anger in africa. it forced the issue of abuse of african migrants heading for europe to the top of the agenda of a summit meant to focus on africa s youth.  european council president donald tusk called the slavery reports  horrifying  during the opening ceremony of the african union european union summit on wednesday.  french president emmanuel macron said the plan included the establishment of an  operational task force  composed of european and african police and intelligence services.  the goal will be in very short order to be able to arrest identified traffickers, dismantle these networks and their financing which goes through banks and payments that in the region contribute ... to sustaining terrorism,  he said late on wednesday.  france would use its military presence in the region to help break up trafficking networks, but the plan would not involve sending french troops into libya, macron said at a press conference in ghana on thursday.   on libyan soil, it is now up to the libyan government to decide in connection with the african union,  he said.  it is important to preserve the sovereignty of libya.     the plan, the details of which emerged on thursday, came from a meeting of un officials, eu leaders and government representatives from chad, niger, morocco, congo and libya that was called by france on wednesday. the european union, african union and united nations agreed to freeze assets and impose financial sanctions against known smugglers.  libya s government, which has promised to investigate  reports of slave auctions, said it would grant u.n. agencies access to migrant camps in areas under its control, german officials said.  eu countries, meanwhile, will finance the repatriation of migrants from libya, a process that is already being organized by the international organization for migration, they said.  allowing africans to come to europe on a temporary basis for three of four years of training or schooling was also discussed, according to european government officials.  circular migration  could be key to easing illegal migration, experts have said.     regional governments have also agreed to educate africans about the dangers of migration, and there will be stronger coordination between security services across north, west and central africa to eradicate smuggling.  vulnerable migrants who might eventually qualify for asylum will be brought to chad or niger before being relocated to a third country either in europe or another region.

" the chances of a contested republican presidential convention slid to their lowest in more than three weeks on wednesday after donald trump swept to a critical victory in new york’s primary, according to predictit, an online market for placing bets on u.s. and world politics. with trump netting most of the state’s 95 delegates and further solidifying his front runner status, the probability of a contested, or brokered, republican convention dropped to 50 percent wednesday morning, down 2 points from tuesday’s closing level, according to data from predictit, which is run by victoria university in wellington, new zealand.  that is the lowest level since march 28 and some 29 percentage points below its peak in early april, after rival ted cruz crushed trump in the wisconsin primary and went to win all 14 wyoming delegates last weekend. ohio governor john kasich, who came in second in new york, remains a long shot candidate. tuesday’s outcome in new york could provide a critical turning point for trump’s momentum. in fact, the chances of his clinching the republican nomination have been increasing steadily. by wednesday morning, the probability reached 63 percent, after an early april slump to 36 percent. to win the nomination outright, trump must line up 1,237 delegates before the republican party’s convention in july. if he fails to do so, party leaders may face the prospect of negotiating a compromise candidate there. the next test comes on april 26, when five northeastern states hold their primaries.

" overuse of harsh sanctions like those deployed against iran to limit its nuclear program risks driving business activity from the united states and a move away from the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, u.s. treasury secretary jack lew said on wednesday. sanctions have emerged as a favored policy tool of choice for the united states, which has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking, cyber attacks, jihadist financing, and russian actions in ukraine. the economic measures enable the u.s. government to blacklist people and organizations, banning u.s. and sometimes even foreign citizens from dealing with them and effectively barring them from the international financial system. for example, the united states was able to induce buyers of iranian oil to sharply curtail their purchases, and international banks cut ties with iran for fear of losing access to the u.s. financial system. iran reached a deal with the united states and other world powers last july that lifted the harshest measures in return for curbs on its nuclear program. but “sanctions overreach” risks encouraging businesses to avoid the u.s. financial system and could erode the power of the u.s. dollar as the pre eminent reserve currency, lew said during a speech in washington. “the more we condition use of the dollar and our financial system on adherence to u.s. foreign policy, the more the risk of migration to other currencies and other financial systems in the medium term grows,” lew said. in particular, so called secondary sanctions should be wielded in the most “exceptional” circumstances, lew said. those measures bar even non u.s. citizens from dealing with sanctioned individuals or companies, and were the type of sanctions levied against iran. “they are viewed even by some of our closest allies as extra territorial attempts to apply u.s. foreign policy to the rest of the world,” lew said, adding that the iran nuclear sanctions should not be viewed as a “starting point” for other sanctions programs. republicans in congress and on the presidential campaign trail have criticized the removal of sanctions on iran, and legislators have tried to restrict president barack obama’s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear deal. but because iran had “kept its end of the deal,” lew said, the united states should uphold the sanctions relief it has promised. in recent weeks, iranian leaders have complained that u.s. policies have forced major banks and corporations to stay away from iran despite the formal lifting of sanctions in january.

" the french military has targeted islamist militants in northern mali near the border with algeria and took 15 militants  out of action , an armed forces spokesman said on thursday. it was not immediately clear if the operation had any connection to the pursuit of assailants who killed four u.s. soldiers in an ambush on oct. 4 in western niger, about 400 kilometres to the south. the french operation in the region of abeibara took place overnight on monday and targeted members of islamist militant group ansar dine, the spokesman said. it involved french mirage jets, attack helicopters and forces on the ground, he added without providing details on how many of the 15 militants targeted had been killed or wounded.  france intervened in mali to ward off an offensive by islamist militants that began in 2012. around 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of operation barkhane, where they work alongside around 10,000 u.n. peacekeepers in mali. the u.s. deaths have drawn attention to counter terror efforts in the arid sahel region where an islamist insurgency involving countless armed groups has been intensifying for years, regularly killing local soldiers.

" argentina s main labor unions took to the streets of the capital on tuesday demanding more jobs and protesting center right president mauricio macri s economic policies.  tens of thousands of workers gathered in the historic plaza de mayo criticizing macri, who is trying to lower labor costs to attract investment and jump start an economy that emerged from recession in the second half of last year.  if some retrograde (in the government) thinks that lowering wages, precarious living conditions and destroying trade unions is going to line up investments... we say that is very wrong,  said juan carlos schmid, a leader of argentina s largest umbrella union, the cgt. standing on a podium at the protest, he said the cgt would meet in late september to discuss a potential strike.  macri told reuters in an interview this month his government was negotiating labor agreements sector by sector rather than trying to pass a comprehensive labor reform like the one approved in neighboring brazil. unions fear more drastic changes could be coming after mid term legislative elections in october, however, especially after a primary vote on aug. 13 pointed to strong support for macri s coalition. macri is trying to open argentina s long protected economy and focus on competitive industries like oil and agriculture, but has seen some manufacturing jobs lost in the meantime.  the most recent employment data showed the jobless rate rose to 9.2 percent in the first quarter of the year from 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.

" south sudan s army clashed with rebels in an oil producing region early on sunday, both sides said, shattering a ceasefire hours after it came into effect.  both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of koch in unity state. seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. there were no immediate details of casualties. the government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on thursday in the latest attempt to end a four year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. the ceasefire formally came into force on sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by reuters.   our forces came under heavy fire this morning in koch county,  dickson gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said.  our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them,  he added in a statement. rebel spokesman lam paul gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town.  the world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after president salva kiir sacked his deputy, riek machar.  the dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to kiir, who is dinka, and machar, who is nuer.  the violence, which the united nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.  earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine.

" european commission chief jean claude juncker told the eu s eastern states on wednesday he would fight for equal rights for their consumers, but their workers would not be allowed to unfairly undercut those in western members. juncker extended an olive branch to the eurosceptic governments in poland, hungary, slovakia and the czech republic in his annual speech on the state of the european union, where east west divisions have driven a painful wedge.  east to west: europe must breathe with both lungs. otherwise our continent will struggle for air,  junker said.  in a union of equals, there can be no second class consumers. i will not accept that in some parts of europe, people are sold food of lower quality than in other countries, despite the packaging and branding being identical.  slovakia, the czech republic, bulgaria and romania have complained that food products sold by multinational producers on their markets are often of poorer quality than the same ones in the west. juncker said national authorities would be given better legal instruments to root out such  illegal practices , an attempt to woo the reluctant easterners at a time when the eu needs unity as it negotiates over the complex terms of britain s departure in 2019. in another gesture toward the eastern states, juncker said it was time to let bulgaria and romania into the eu s schengen zone of passport free travel.  but he also said the bloc would go ahead with reforming its labor rules, which now allow workers from the poorer eu east to work in the wealthier west for low salaries. french president emmanuel macron has made ending this practice, which he says amounts to social dumping, a key priority. the eastern states are opposed, saying they should be allowed to compete in that way to catch up after decades of communist rule after world war two. while the so called  posted workers  only represent around one percent of the eu workforce, the issue has become sensitive. eu diplomats say the bloc will change the current rules, a plan also backed by belgium, the netherlands and luxembourg, in a move that could make it easier for macron to carry out economic reforms at home by showing he is delivering for french workers.  in a union of equals, there can be no second class workers. workers should earn the same pay for the same work in the same place,  juncker said, adding he would seek to establish an eu labour agency  for ensuring fairness in our single market.  juncker said he was  saddened  with the refusal by the ex communist eastern states to take in refugees arriving in the bloc to help their western and southern peers.  more than two years of bruising battles over migration have caused a lot of bad blood in the eu, spilling over to other policy areas and reinforcing calls from the west to cut generous eu funding for the eastern states who deny help.  but juncker reserved his most pointed criticism for poland and hungary, where nationalist governments have clashed with the brussels on multiple issues, including a contested judiciary overhaul in poland and hungary s continued rejection of refugees despite the bloc s top court ruling that they must be taken in.   the rule of law means that law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary,  juncker said.  the judgments of the european court of justice have to be respected by all.   to undermine them, or to undermine the independence of national courts, is to strip citizens of their fundamental rights. the rule of law is not optional in the european union. it is a must.  as the eu contemplates deeper integration after britain s departure, the eastern states   mostly outside the euro zone   fear they will be pushed out of the decision making core and will lose out in a  multi speed  eu. juncker offered some reassurances on that, saying he did not favor a separate euro zone budget, or a euro zone finance minister, but closer ties between all 27 eu states remaining after brexit.

" indonesian president joko widodo will on friday hold his cabinet meeting on the holiday island of bali in a bid to reassure visitors that there is nothing to worry about from the rumbling mount agung volcano. authorities last month raised the alert status of mount agung in northeastern bali to the highest level, imposing an exclusion zone of up to 10 km (6 miles) around its crater as it spewed clouds of ash, steam, and other volcanic material.     widodo will take the unusual step of gathering his cabinet in bali as part of government efforts to assure visitors that the island is safe to come to and to stave off a major drop off in visitor numbers during the upcoming holiday season.  for those who have plans to vacation in bali, there s no need to doubt or be worried about the status of mount agung, bali is very safe to visit,  energy minister ignasius jonan said in a twitter message after visiting an observatory overlooking the volcano, before the cabinet meeting. president widodo is expected to make a statement after the cabinet meeting. the cabinet usually meets at the state palace in the capital jakarta or on its outskirts in bogor. the relatively small island of bali, famous for its beaches and temples, has an outsized importance for indonesian tourism. in january september, bali received 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals, nearly half of the 10.5 million arrivals in indonesia. tourism minister arief yahya said this week that indonesia was expecting an estimated 15 trillion rupiah ($1.11 billion) in lost income and around 1 million fewer tourists because of the volcano, according to daily newspaper kompas. many business operators and hotels have seen cancellations since authorities first raised the alert in september, and most expect the holiday season to be slower than in previous years. thousands of tourists were left stranded late last month when a volcanic ash cloud forced the closure of bali s airport for several days. countries like australia and singapore have advised their citizens to be cautious when traveling to bali.

" the world health organization (who) on friday urged u.s. president elect donald trump to expand obamacare and ensure all americans have access to healthcare. the real estate magnate takes office next month after promising to repeal outgoing president barack obama’s signature healthcare policy which helped millions more americans get medical insurance but has been a target of republican attacks. agnes soucat, the who’s director of health system governance and financing, said there were various ways of providing health cover to more people, and it amounted to “political choices.” “we as the who really encourage the new administration to make sure that the social contract is expanded and that all u.s. citizens have access to health care,” soucat told a news briefing in geneva. the united states is the only country among the 35 member states of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) not to provide universal health care, a key  u.n. sustainable development goal for 2030, she said. the affordable care act, known commonly as obamacare, has provided some 25 million previously uninsured americans with health cover. republicans say it has created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. trump in late november picked republican u.s. representative tom price, an orthopedic surgeon from georgia and obamacare critic, to be his health secretary. price has long championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts, and lawsuit reforms to replace obamacare. republicans are divided over how quickly an obamacare repeal should go into effect, with some saying a delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of americans out of their health insurance with no substitute. “there are different strategies to make universal health care particularly pro poor,” soucat said. “so what we are saying is, yes, this would be a setback if people would lose coverage.” ",0

" a bipartisan group of u.s. senators renewed an effort on tuesday to shift the military’s handling of sexual assault cases from top commanders to independent prosecutors, insisting that the current system has left victims too fearful of retaliation to report crimes. senator kirsten gillibrand, a democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the national defense authorization act, or ndaa, a must pass annual bill that sets policy for the pentagon. the measure failed to pass the senate in march 2014, though gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid “false and misleading information” the pentagon used to bolster its own argument. “we know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and it’s clear that nothing has changed,” gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both democratic and republican senators. the current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them.  top military leaders at the pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline. “nobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape,” republican senator rand paul said. the bill failed by 55 45 in 2014. gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is “very hopeful” the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the senate. “i think many senators that we’ve spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned,” she said. “the military continues to say, ‘we got this,’ ... but it’s not shown in the data. it’s not shown in the survivors’ testimony.” she said the bill has not gotten support from republican senator john mccain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue. samantha jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the army, said the military told the u.s. attorney’s office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges. jackson called her treatment “a profound betrayal,” adding, “i don’t understand how the army could fail to hold my rapist accountable.” ",0

" donald trump on friday named u.s. senator mike lee as a potential supreme court nominee, turning to an ally of former rival ted cruz in an apparent gesture to conservative republicans who have been wary of the republican presidential candidate.  lee was included on a new list of 21 potential supreme court justices that trump would consider for the high court if he is elected over democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. “this list is definitive and i will choose only from it in picking future justices of the united states supreme court,” trump said in a statement. the announcement came out on a day in which neither candidate had a public event and were preparing for monday’s first presidential debate. the list trump announced included 10 new names and 11 conservative jurists from a list the new york businessman had announced in may. lee’s brother, thomas lee, an associate justice of the utah supreme court, was on the initial list and remains on trump’s expanded list. trump’s listing of mike lee amounted to a gesture to u.s. senator cruz of texas, a conservative who fought trump fiercely as a rival for the republican presidential nomination and who has refused to endorse trump. trump’s bombastic style and proposals breaking with some conservative orthodoxies such as support for free trade agreements have sparked unease among traditional conservative republicans.  mike lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “right now i’m focused on my job in the senate, where i’m in a good position to defend the constitution by fighting against government overreach. both lists that i’ve seen from the trump campaign are fantastic.  “while my brother and i might disagree as to which list is better, they’re both great,” he quipped. the death of conservative justice antonin scalia on feb. 13 left the court with a four to four tie between right leaning and left leaning justices. democratic president barack obama has nominated merrick garland, chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals in washington, but the republican controlled u.s. senate has refused to consider confirming him. trump said his list was based on who would follow constitutional principles on the high court. the possibility of republicans ceding control of the court to the democrats has been one of his main rallying cries at campaign events. others on trump’s list include keith blackwell, a justice on the supreme court of georgia; charles canady, a florida supreme court justice; neil gorsuch, a judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit, and edward mansfield, an iowa supreme court justice. other names included federico moreno, a judge of the u.s. district court for the southern district of florida; margaret ryan, a judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces; amul thapar, a judge of the u.s. district court for the eastern district of kentucky; timothy tymkovich, chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit; and robert young, chief justice of the supreme court of michigan.

" new jersey governor chris christie is not expected to attend the trial this week of two former associates charged in the 2013 “bridgegate” scandal, but the failed republican presidential hopeful’s shadow will loom over the proceedings. opening statements are scheduled for monday in federal court in newark, new jersey. bill baroni and bridget anne kelly are charged with conspiracy and fraud in a nine count indictment alleging they arranged lane closings that caused gridlock on the heavily traveled george washington bridge. the resulting traffic delayed commuters for hours and left emergency vehicles slow in responding to 911 calls. prosecutors said the two defendants planned the lane closures to take revenge on a mayor who refused to endorse christie for re election. the governor, at one time a leading republican presidential hopeful, has not been charged in the scandal that nevertheless helped torpedo his hopes for nomination to the white house in 2016. in the three years since the scandal broke, christie has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the plan to disrupt traffic on the world’s busiest road bridge, despite speculation to the contrary. the trial could finally provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he knew about the alleged plot, and if so, when. “bridgegate” took place after democratic fort lee mayor mark sokolich declined to endorse the governor’s reelection campaign in 2013. christie was seeking support from local mayors to demonstrate bipartisan backing for a republican governor in a democratic leaning state, part of an effort to position himself for a 2016 white house bid. prosecutors say the lane closures were ordered in september 2013 by kelly, christie’s then deputy chief of staff; baroni, then deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey; and david wildstein, another christie ally at the port authority who has since pleaded guilty.  the gw carries more than 250,000 vehicles a day across the hudson river between new jersey and manhattan. the trio concocted a cover story, saying the closure was part of a traffic study, prosecutors contend. the shutdown lasted four days, while baroni and wildstein ignored increasingly frantic messages from the mayor, according to prosecutors. the ruse fell apart under scrutiny from journalists and the democratic controlled state legislature. in january 2014, emails and text messages were publicly disclosed that showed the officials’ involvement, including an aug. 13, 2013, email in which kelly told wildstein: “time for some traffic problems in fort lee.” wildstein, who is expected to be a star government witness, has previously said there is evidence that christie was aware of the lane closures when they occurred. jurors also may hear from kelly and baroni, as lawyers for both defendants have said they plan to testify in their own defense. the defense has suggested it will point the finger at others, including christie, in arguing that kelly and baroni would never have acted on their own. in a pretrial motion, a lawyer for baroni revealed that a former christie aide said in a text message that the governor “flat out lied” when he said during a 2013 press conference that none of his senior staff were involved in the scandal.  a spokesman for the governor has said the text message does not disprove christie’s contention that he was unaware of the plot. since abandoning his own candidacy for president, christie has become one of republican nominee donald trump’s most visible supporters.

" anyone seeking a table at carmine’s italian restaurant near capitol hill on a tuesday or wednesday needs to battle a mid week crush of congress members and their staff. but mondays are far quieter — just like the floor of congress. there are usually around nine events on a monday, compared to as many as 30 on a midweek day, says kelly fitzgerald, carmine’s director of special events and catering.  the mid week crunch at carmine’s underscores a trend: members of the u.s. congress have been spending fewer days working in washington since the late 2000s, according to a reuters review of congressional records going back 18 years. lawmakers increasingly try to cram their legislative work into the middle of the week in washington and then rush back home. their absence from the capital reinforces the effects of a deepening partisan divide in recent years that has led to high profile deadlocks over legislation previously seen as routine, according to some former lawmakers and political analysts. under pressure to spend more time in their home constituencies, often fund raising for campaigns, members have less time to attend debates and mingle with other lawmakers.  “in any work setting, if you don’t know your colleagues, it makes it much more difficult to get things done,” said dan glickman, who was a democratic house member from kansas for 18 years until the mid 1990s and recalls more working days and fuller debates than the current congress. “...it makes it more difficult to build relationships,” said glickman, who was u.s. secretary of agriculture after congress.  he was a member of the bipartisan policy center’s commission on political reform, which recommended in 2014 that congress be in session conducting legislative business for 180 to 200 days a year. (graphic on congressional working days: tmsnrt.rs/1vsssoz) in 2015, the first year of a two year congress, the house of representatives put in 130 working days, the reuters review found. compared with the first years of recent congresses, that number has declined steadily since 2007, when the house worked 153 days — the high since 1998. house members typically meet more often in the first year of a congress because in the second year they have to run for reelection. this year, an election year, the house calendar foresees 111 working days in washington, in line with the total in recent election years.   the house cancelled its entire schedule last week after a snowstorm hit the east coast. the senate’s annual working days have not risen above 156 since reaching a peak of 188 in 2009. the decline in working days in recent years has coincided with a slide in americans’ approval rating for the legislature as the reputation of a “do nothing” congress has taken hold. since fiscal 1997, congress has failed every year to enact on time all of the government appropriations bills needed for a full federal budget, the congressional research service said. more recently, polarized lawmakers often have been unable to find middle ground on pressing issues such as immigration, tax reform and gun safety. as of the end of 2014, about 75 percent of major issues were in deadlock, according to a calculation by sarah binder of the brookings institution think tank. mid week squeeze to be sure, members of the house and the senate, who are paid $174,000 a year, do important work outside of washington. they meet with constituents in their home districts and raise campaign money by appearing and speaking at events. representative ryan zinke, a freshman republican and former u.s. navy seal, said congress could use more “team building” activities, but he has not felt the need for more days in legislative session. zinke is the only house member representing the large, sparsely populated state of montana, and says he needs lots of travel time just to see his constituents. “last week i think i put on about 2,500 miles (4,000 km) traveling around montana, and i saw about a third of the state,” he said. staying in legislative session more does not necessarily equate to getting more work done, said don stewart, spokesman for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a republican.  “it’s a matter of what you do with the time you are here, not just the total time you are here,” he said. the republican led congress had a relatively productive year in 2015, fixing a funding formula for medicare doctors, passing a highway bill and approving fast track authority for trade deals. in 2011 and 2013, the total number of bills passed by congress dipped below triple figures to 90 and 72 respectively. last year’s congress managed to enact 113. many bills are minor, however, so the total number does not necessarily correspond to productivity. “pro forma” sessions the recent decline in overall working days does not tell the whole story. there has also been a rise in so called “pro forma” days when lawmakers go into session sometimes for just a few minutes or even seconds, for procedural reasons. they are formally counted as sessions of the house and senate, but reuters did not include them in its tally.  last year the house had 27 pro forma days, none of which lasted more than seven minutes, the reuters review found. in each of the last five years the house had more pro forma days than in previous congresses going back to 2002. those days are usually scheduled for monday or friday, enabling lawmakers to fly in and out of washington without missing mid week votes.  the typical house member returns to their district 40 or more times a year, said brad fitch of congressional management foundation, a nonprofit that advises lawmakers on managing their offices. it did a study showing that in 2013, the average house freshman spent $53,170 of taxpayer money on travel. these days, fewer lawmakers move their families to the capital to live, said john fortier, director of the democracy project at the bipartisan policy center, a washington think tank. paul ryan, the wisconsin republican who has been speaker of the house since october, sleeps on a cot in his washington office during the congressional work week and flies home to his family in wisconsin on the weekend. vin weber, who was a republican congressman from minnesota in the 1980s and 1990s, said that in the attempt to juggle all the demands they face at home and in washington, today’s lawmakers have set themselves an impossible schedule. “they are on planes constantly, back and forth, all the time,” he said. “there’s no rationality to it at all.” the rising cost of election campaigns mean lawmakers have to devote more time to fund raising outside washington, said glickman, now a senior fellow at the bipartisan policy center. as a congressman, glickman said, he often went to the house floor just to listen to the debate.  “if i did that now, i would be guilty of malpractice,” he said. “you need to be either in committee doing your work or raising money.”

" iran may abandon the nuclear deal it reached with six major powers if the united states decides to withdraw from it, iranian  foreign minister told qatar s al jazeera tv in new york. u.s. president donald trump has called the 2015 deal an  embarrassment . the deal is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran and its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen tensions in the middle east.  if washington decides to pull out of the deal, iran has the option of withdrawal and other options,  al jazeera tv wrote on its twitter feed, quoting mohammad javad zarif.   washington will be in a better position if it remains committed to the deal,  the network quoted zarif as saying. al jazeera deleted an earlier tweet citing zarif as saying that if washington withdrew from the deal iran would do so too, rather than just having the option to do so, after an iranian official said zarif had been misquoted. trump is considering whether the accord serves u.s. security interests. he faces a mid october deadline for certifying that iran is complying with the pact. a state department official said washington would not comment on every statement by an iranian official.  we are fully committed to addressing the totality of iranian threats and malign activities,  the official said. iranian authorities had repeatedly said tehran would not be the first to violate the agreement, under which tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy. the prospect that washington could renege on the deal has worried some of the u.s. allies that helped negotiate it. french president emmanuel macron said last week that there was no alternative to the nuclear accord. if trump, who has called the accord  the worst deal ever negotiated , does not recertify it by oct. 16, congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions suspended under the accord.

" preet bharara, the top federal prosecutor in manhattan known for pursuing a series of cases targeting public corruption and crime on wall street, said on wednesday he has agreed to remain in his post after donald trump becomes u.s. president. bharara, appointed to his position by democratic president barack obama in 2009, told reporters following a meeting with the republican president elect at trump tower in manhattan that trump asked him to stay on during his administration and he accepted. trump takes office on jan. 20. “we had a good meeting,” bharara said. “i said i would absolutely consider staying on. i agreed to stay on.” the announcement’s timing, when trump has not yet finished filling all cabinet level positions, was unusual. but some former prosecutors who served under bharara said they were not surprised their former boss would be willing to remain as the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york. “i think preet is an independent, law enforcement minded prosecutor who loves his job and is clearly talented in it,” said arlo devlin brown, a former chief of bharara’s public corruption unit who is now a partner at the law firm covington & burling. u.s. senator charles schumer of new york, the incoming senate democratic leader who bharara previously worked for as chief counsel, said trump called him last week to ask what he thought about bharara staying in his job. “i am glad they met and am glad preet is staying on,” schumer said in a statement. “he’s been one of the best u.s. attorneys new york has ever seen.” bharara’s office has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics, an agenda that could fit with trump’s vow to “drain the swamp” in washington. those political investigations led last year to the convictions of former new york assembly speaker sheldon silver, a democrat, and former new york senate majority leader dean skelos, a republican, in separate corruption trials. bharara also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders and was on the cover of time magazine in 2012 with the headline “this man is busting wall st.” those cases include the 2011 conviction of galleon group founder raj rajaratnam, who is serving an 11 year prison term, and a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund sac capital advisors lp. his 227 lawyer office also secured corporate settlements with companies including general motors co and jpmorgan chase & co; won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of ponzi scheme operator bernard madoff; and prosecuted suleiman abu ghaith, a son in law of the late al qaeda leader osama bin laden. bharara’s office’s priorities have often matched those set by obama’s justice department. amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, bharara’s office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in new york city’s rikers island jail complex. how priorities set by the justice department under trump’s pick for attorney general, republican senator jeff sessions of alabama, affects the cases bharara’s office pursues remains unclear. “obviously there is likely be some changes in priorities from main justice (the department’s washington headquarters), and the office will have to adjust to those,” said richard zabel, who previously served as bharara’s deputy before becoming hedge fund elliott management’s general counsel. bharara said his office had for the past seven years pursued its work “independently, without fear or favor.” former prosecutors they expect that to stay the same. “he would have only taken it on if he were 100 percent confident that that independence could be preserved,” said matthew schwartz, partner at the law firm boies, schiller & flexner and a former prosecutor under bharara.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said on monday she will not accept an invitation from mexican president enrique pena nieto for a visit after rival donald trump created what she called a “diplomatic incident” in his foray there. in a written excerpt from an interview with abc news that will air tuesday morning, clinton simply said “no” when asked if she would travel to mexico before the election on nov. 8, without elaborating further. her campaign later confirmed her decision. “we understand and respect her decision to propose the time to hold a meeting,” said mexican foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu in a tweet, adding that contact with clinton’s campaign was ongoing. pena nieto extended invitations to both candidates last month, and trump flew to mexico city last wednesday for a meeting that appeared to be friendly but later revealed deep tensions. trump, the republican presidential nominee, has been highly critical of mexico, saying the country sends rapists and drug dealers to the united states. he has called for a wall to be built on the border that would be paid for by mexico.  trump said at a joint news conference with pena nieto that they did not discuss who would pay for the wall. pena nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on twitter that he made it clear mexico would not pay for the wall. “he came out saying one thing and the mexican president contradicted him almost immediately,” clinton, a former u.s. secretary of state, said in the abc interview. “he didn’t raise it, so he did choke. he didn’t know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state. and i think that’s a pretty clear outcome from that trip,” she added.

" the obama administration is evaluating whether an international agreement reached earlier this month to cut back on greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners will need approval by the u.s. senate, the white house said on tuesday. nearly 200 countries, including the united states and china, signed on to a deal in kigali, rwanda that would reduce the use of factory made hydrofluorocarbon (hfc) gases. white house spokesman josh earnest said it is unclear whether the accord, which is an amendment to the 1987 montreal protocol, would need to be ratified by the u.s. senate. the 1987 montreal protocol succeeded in phasing out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs), widely used at that time in refrigeration and aerosols.     “there has been an ongoing analysis of the agreement to determine precisely what role congress may have to play in ensuring that the united states can keep the commitments that were made in the context of that agreement,” earnest told reporters traveling with president barack obama at a fundraiser in los angeles. obama believes the agreement would serve the national interest of the united states by helping to curb the impact of climate change and by bolstering u.s. companies that develop alternatives to hfcs, earnest said. he noted that any vote on the agreement would likely take place after obama leaves office in january. “there will be a very strong case to make to the senate about why they should approve this agreement, if in fact their approval is necessary,” he said.",0

"it is truly a shame that our nation has $25 million dollars to waste on phony climate change.  that money could  have gone a long way in helping children and adults who are suffering and dying of malnourishment. this president and the democrats who support his phony war on climate change should be ashamed of themselves. a $25 million u.s.-funded project to help guatemala combat global warming is being slammed as another taxpayer-backed boondoggle after a new audit highlighted a series of problems   including numerous inaccuracies in the group s work and a failure to produce a required long-term plan.without the plan, the government audit warned,  the funds   could be wasted. the grant for the climate, nature and communities in guatemala program was awarded to the nonprofit rainforest alliance in february 2013 by the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) as part of a broader effort to fight climate change abroad.meanwhile, guatemala is ranked as the 7th poorest nation in the world. parentless children like elvin usaid s office of inspector general, which issued the audit last month, said the program was set up to help organizations and small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in guatemala improve climate-change strategies and strengthen local ngos so the country s environment could be conserved without future u.s. assistance. the report noted that as of february 2015, $10.5 million had been disbursed so far.the audit acknowledged the program was making  some progress,  but it also alleged a laundry list of violations   including that the reported results were not accurate.the watchdog reported that data-testing revealed 22 errors in the accounting of whether the program was on track.one example given was that the rainforest alliance reported 162,356 hectares of land now devoted to timber and nontimber products such as cacao and honey. but a review found the group had counted the same hectares multiple times.the rainforest alliance also reported it had created 30,149 part-time and permanent jobs  generated through new sustainable, productive activities undertaken by program-assisted community-based organizations and smes.  however, the audit found 23,936 of those  jobs  may have lasted no more than a day.the audit also found that a required comprehensive  sustainability plan  on how the program will continue after usaid s assistance ends was not completed, despite it being required and the project having been underway for two years. without a sustainability plan, the funds used to help the guatemalan government and other partners manage the country s natural resources to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change could be wasted,  the report said.the report was first flagged by judicial watch, a conservative watchdog group which called the project an  egregious waste of taxpayer dollars  and  par for the course with virtually all of the obama administration s  green  ventures, which have largely failed after getting hundreds of millions in federal funds. among other violations, the audit also found that while the rainforest alliance was supposed to contribute at least $3.75 million as a form of cost-sharing, the $1.79 million it reported as having contributed by december 2014 included $26,708 of u.s. funds it received under a separate project.the auditors also found that participants didn t undergo background checks, breaking a government funding rule that background checks must be performed on anyone seeking to participate in usaid-sponsored training.   fox newsif you d like to help one or more of these malnourished children in guatemala, click here to donate.",1

" president barack obama on monday urged u.s. insurers offering coverage next year under his national healthcare law to step up their efforts to enroll those who remain uninsured, especially younger and healthier americans. several big insurers, including unitedhealth group inc, aetna inc and humana inc, have announced they will pull back from the obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing financial losses due to the costs of covering members who are sicker than expected. their planned exit has prompted new questions over whether obamacare can survive over the long term if insurers cannot create a viable business from the market. insurance premiums for consumers have jumped each year since obamacare plans took effect in 2014, and those price increases are expected to grow steeper as fewer insurers participate.  obama, in a letter to all insurers selling health plans next year on the exchanges, noted that the program has helped reduce the percentage of americans without health insurance to a record low, and acknowledged that it could still be improved to benefit insurers and consumers. his administration will help find and enroll those who still lack coverage, with a particular focus on enrolling young adults.  “since the remaining uninsured are disproportionately younger and healthier, signing them up improves the risk pool and consequently the affordability of coverage for all enrollees,” obama said in the letter.  obama, secretary of health and human services sylvia burwell and other top health advisers on monday met with executives from several leading insurance companies, including cigna corp chief executive david cordani and humana ceo bruce broussard, to discuss ways to strengthen the marketplace ahead of its fourth open enrollment period, which begins nov. 1, according to a white house official.         a spokeswoman for industry group america’s health insurance plans said the meeting’s focus included increasing enrollment.  “as health plans are preparing for open enrollment, today’s meeting was focused on how to build on the continued progress in reducing the uninsured rate and moving forward with policy solutions that will support a stable, affordable market for 2017 and beyond,” ahip spokeswoman clare krusing said.

" u.s. president donald trump should  under no circumstances  take military action against north korea without the consent of the government in seoul, the chairwoman of south korea s ruling party, choo mi ae, said on wednesday.  president trump often emphasizes that he put all options on the table,  choo told a washington think tank.  we want to make sure that this option of another war is not placed on the table. under no circumstances should the u.s. go ahead and use a military option without the consent of south korea.   we must seek a peaceful resolution of the matter in any manner that is available to us.  the remarks by choo, who is expected to meet trump administration officials in washington, underscored south korean concerns that any u.s. strikes against north korea s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating north korean retaliation against south korea. visiting seoul last week, trump warned north korea he was prepared to use the full range of u.s. military power to stop any attack, but also urged pyongyang to  make a deal.  trump, who had previously called negotiations with north korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks and has sent mixed signals about his interest in negotiations. speaking on his return from asia, trump said he and chinese president xi jinping had rejected a  freeze for freeze  agreement. china and russia have previously advocated such a plan, where the united states and south korea stop major military exercises in exchange for north korea halting its weapons programs. it was not clear if this was what trump meant.  we agreed that we would not accept a so called  freeze for freeze  agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past,  trump said. there was no immediate comment from china s embassy in washington. pyongyang has shown little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. choo, whose president and fellow democratic party leader moon jae in has advocated dialogue with north korea, said seoul backed trump s policy of maximum pressure on pyongyang through sanctions and there should be no talks for the sake of talks. however, she said blocking opportunities for dialogue could prompt north korean  miscalculation.  she declined to say whether she was satisfied with the trump administration s limited efforts to talk to pyongyang to resolve the crisis stemming from north korea s efforts to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states.

(think vince foster)klaus eberwein, a former haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of clinton foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in miami. he was 50.eberwein was due to appear next tuesday before the haitian senate ethics and anti-corruption commission where he was widely expected to testify that the clinton foundation misappropriated haiti earthquake donations from international donors.eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the clinton foundation s activities in the caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency, fonds d assistance  conomique et social, for three years.according to eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the clinton foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting haitians actually ended up in the hands of haitian organizations. a further 9.6% ended up with the haitian government. the remaining 89.8%   or $5.4 billion   was funneled to non-haitian organizations. the clinton foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,  eberwein said at a protest outside the clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan last year.the former director general of haiti, who also served as an advisor to haitian president michel martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in haiti, muncheez, and even has a pizza   the klaus special   named after him.according to the haiti libre newspaper, eberwein was said to be in  good spirits , with plans for the future. his close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. it s really shocking,  said muncheez s owner gilbert bailly.  we grew up together; he was like family.   your news wireamericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the clinton crime family when in september of 2016, former senate president of haiti, bernard sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a trump campaign event in little haiti, fl. sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the clinton s dirty dealings in haiti while he was still in office. to his credit, candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the clinton s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white house.sansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti. his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to  side  with the clinton administration and he would  be the richest man in haiti. he also demanded that hillary clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation. not even 2% of that money went back to haiti. so mr. trump, we are asking you, begging you, the haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. haiti is a very poor country. haiti needs defenders. you said you would champion our cause. we welcome you sir and we will work with you. ask hillary clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti. go to the 5 minute mark of the video to see sansaricq s comments to candidate trump:",1
" senior trump administration officials said on sunday that the united states was committed to remaining part of the iran nuclear accord for now, despite president donald trump s criticisms of the deal and his warnings that he might pull out. nikki haley, u.s. ambassador to the united nations, said that tehran is complying with the 2015 nuclear accord intended to increase iran s accountability in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions.  i think right now, you re going to see us stay in the deal,  haley told nbc s  meet the press.  in a speech on friday, trump laid out an aggressive approach on iran and said he would not certify it is complying with the nuclear accord, despite a determination by the united nations  nuclear watchdog that tehran is meeting its terms. the republican president threw the issue to the u.s. congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reinstate u.s. sanctions. he warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.  so far, none of the other signatories to the deal   britain, france, germany, russia, china, iran and the european union   have cited serious concerns, leaving the united states isolated. in her  meet the press  interview, haley said the united states was not saying that iran was in breach of the agreement, but she raised concerns about its activities that are not covered by the pact, including weapons sales and sponsorship of militant groups such as hezbollah. haley said that other countries were  turning a blind eye  to these iranian activities in order to  protect  the nuclear agreement. she said the united states needed to weigh a  proportionate  response to tehran s actions on the world stage.  the goal at the end of the day is to hold iran accountable,  haley said in the interview, which mainly focused on the joint comprehensive plan of action, as the nuclear deal is formally known. haley and u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson hammered away at the need to address what they see as shortcomings in the two year old international accord while simultaneously placing pressure to rein in iranian activities outside the scope of that deal. tillerson, alluding to other signatory countries  opposition to reopening the iran pact, raised the possibility of  a second agreement  to run parallel to the existing one. among the  areas of concern  he mentioned were its sunset provisions and tehran s ballistic missile program. haley also said the reason the united states was looking closely at the iran nuclear deal is because of escalating tensions over north korea s nuclear weapons development.  what we re saying now with iran is don t let it become the next north korea.  on friday, trump also said he was authorizing the u.s. treasury to sanction iran s revolutionary guards, and on sunday treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he was planning to move ahead. mnuchin, interviewed on fox news   sunday morning futures,  said he has spoken about iran with his counterparts attending world bank and international monetary fund meetings in recent days. he did not provide any details on possible sanctions.   u.s. senator susan collins, appearing on abc s  this week,  noted that trump could have taken a more extreme step by withdrawing from the agreement. but in words of support for trump, the moderate republican lawmaker said,  instead, he put a spotlight on two troubling deficiencies in the agreement,  referring to a lack of limitations on iran s tests of ballistic missiles and a  pathway to developing a nuclear weapon  down the road. while many u.s. allies strongly criticized trump s decision not to recertify the iran deal, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu praised the move, saying the current terms of the iran nuclear accord would allow it to have a nuclear stockpile within a decade.  we cannot allow this rogue regime 30 times the size of north korea s economy to have a nuclear arsenal,  netanyahu said on cbs   face the nation.

" a lottery drawing to settle a tied virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on tuesday, after the democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. the decision to put off the high stakes lotto, originally scheduled for wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by a single vote.  a victory by simonds would shift republicans’ slim control of the 100 member house of delegates to an even 50 50 split with the democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power sharing arrangement. a day after simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey. that decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of newport news in southeastern virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. simonds asked a state court to reconsider on tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. an image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by simonds’ name. the voter selected republicans for other offices. simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, “recounts would become a never ending spiral of courtroom challenges.” the chairman of the virginia board of elections, james alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered “an action of last resort.” he added: “any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.”    yancey’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the virginia house republican caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. “we believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,” spokesman parker slaybaugh said. virginia department of elections spokeswoman andrea gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. democrats notched historic gains in virginia’s statehouse elections last month, part of the party’s first big wave of political victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. before the nov. 7 general election, virginia republicans held 66 seats to the democrats’ 34 in the house of delegates, along with a majority in the state senate.

" creditors of puerto rico’s government development bank on monday sued to stop it from distributing money to creditors in what they call “preferential transfers” ahead of the gdb’s may 1 debt payment that puerto rico’s governor says may not be payable. hedge funds including brigade capital management and claren road asset management, which hold some of gdb’s $3.75 billion in debt, asked a federal court in san juan, puerto rico, to bar municipalities, public entities and other depositors from removing their money, to prevent a run on the bank. the lawsuit is the latest sign of an increasingly urgent financial crisis in puerto rico, which has $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population.  puerto rico’s governor, alejandro garcia padilla, has said the gdb is near insolvency, and is considering a moratorium on debt payments. the gdb has a payment due on may 1 of approximately $422 million. the island, as a whole, faces a july 1 payment of $1.55 billion on various debt classes. the gdb and its creditors are in the midst of restructuring talks that could lead to a forbearance agreement or debt restructuring. monday’s lawsuit was filed to give those talks time to evolve without a fear of a run on the bank, said donald bernstein, a lawyer for the creditors. “gdb needs to be able to fund essential services, but to the extent money is being pulled out by people who want to bail out of the situation at the expense of other creditors, that shouldn’t happen,” bernstein said in an interview. gdb acts as the commonwealth’s main liquidity source, with public agencies drawing on accounts to fund services and pay their own debt. gdp president melba acosta febo said the central claim of the lawsuit, that the bank withheld financial information in order to prefer certain depositors over its bondholders, is false and not based in fact. “although the specific allegations set forth in the lawsuit are erroneous, it is clear that our creditors agree with us on one thing: puerto rico’s fiscal situation is dismal, the island’s debt is unpayable, and the need for a federal restructuring regime to help the commonwealth on the road to recovery is acute,” acosta said in a statement. a default at the gdb could allow creditors to seek the appointment of a receiver, a process that would be triggered by puerto rico’s treasury secretary, juan zaragoza.  zaragoza last week resigned his membership on gdb’s board of directors, which a source close to the restructuring talks at gdb told reuters was done to avoid a conflict of interest in the event he must appoint a receiver. the same source said the island’s treasury department is not considering removing money from gdb, but is considering opening new accounts at other banks in the event gdb becomes insolvent.

" the political alliance sealed on friday between republican presidential candidate donald trump and new jersey governor chris christie was more than a decade in the making, the culmination of the two men’s repeatedly crossing paths. christie, a former rival for the republican nomination for president, endorsed trump at a surprise news conference in fort worth, texas, giving the front runner a lift ahead of the march 1 super tuesday nominating contests. christie, a former federal prosecutor, told reporters his endorsement was not part of any deal that would land him a position, such as u.s. attorney general, in a possible trump administration. trump, 69, and christie, 53, have been friendly dinner companions and have operated professionally in the same state. christie has been one of new jersey’s top political figures since 2001 and trump has been a major employer and real estate developer in the state beginning in the 1980s when he began to run casinos in atlantic city, the new jersey seaside resort that had fallen on hard times and was being remade as a sort of las vegas of the east coast. the close geographic ties differentiate christie from politicians who operate farther from trump’s base in new york city, said ben dworkin, director of the rebovich institute for new jersey politics at rider university. “they were bound to cross paths and come to know each other,” dworkin said. trump sat in the front pew at a catholic mass celebrating christie’s swearing in for his first term as new jersey’s governor in january 2010. “he’s going to be a great governor, which new jersey could use. he will go down as the best governor there is,” trump told reporters, according to the press of atlantic city. trump’s sister, maryanne trump barry, a federal appeals court judge, introduced the two in 2002, according to the record of bergen county. christie was named the state’s chief federal prosecutor in 2001 by president george w. bush. the trumps and the christies have often had dinner together, where trump would do all the talking, according to “american governor,” a christie biography written by matt katz and published in january. christie attended trump’s 2005 wedding, to his current wife, melania, where christie met bill and hillary clinton, according to the book. the christie trump relationship, “if anything, would be socializing with big important people. they’re both collectors,” said rutgers university senior policy fellow marc pfeiffer. as christie sought to build his national profile, trump helped. trump gave $250,000 to the republican governors association in 2014 when christie was its head, according to the center for responsive politics, a nonprofit that maintains a database of political donations. representatives of trump’s casinos lobbied christie as early as 1996 when christie was a little own local officeholder in morris county, according to the star ledger. the newspaper reported at the time that the county board of freeholders was considering a highway project that would affect trump’s casinos in atlantic city. trump founded trump entertainment resorts inc and ran casinos in atlantic city beginning in the 1980s. he resigned as chairman before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, about a year before christie became governor and took on a larger role in the city’s struggles.  trump entertainment resorts emerged from chapter 11 reorganization in july 2010, with trump acquiring a smaller stake in the company. it now runs one atlantic city casino, the trump taj mahal. christie’s biggest push for development in atlantic city was to support the revel casino project. the revel opened in 2012, well after trump had reduced his holdings in atlantic city. it closed in 2014.  trump’s presence in new jersey could extend well beyond his career or friendship with christie. according to media reports, he plans to be buried in the state at a private cemetery at one of his golf courses after he dies.

war. the intervention by ahmed ali saleh, a former leader of the elite republican guard once seen as a likely successor to his father, gives the anti houthi movement in sanaa a potential figurehead, after a week of fighting that saw the houthis rout saleh s supporters in the capital. yemen s war, pitting the iran allied houthis who control sanaa against a saudi led military alliance backing a government based in the south, has brought what the united nations calls the world s worst humanitarian crisis. the world body says millions of people may die in one of the worst famines of modern times, caused by warring parties blocking food supplies. saleh had helped the houthis win control of much of the country s north including sanaa, and his decision to switch allegiances and abandon the houthis in the past week was the most dramatic change on the battlefield in years. but the houthis swiftly crushed a pro saleh uprising in the capital and shot him dead in an attack on his convoy. tens of thousands of houthi supporters staged a rally in the capital on tuesday to show support for their leader and celebrate the death of saleh. they chanted slogans against saudi arabia and its allies.  mahmoud ali al houthi, head of the movement s revolutionary committee, denied allegations that the group was executing members of saleh s party after their capture:  we have been treating some of saleh s sons and we haven t executed them,  he told the crowd.  sanaa saw no fresh fighting on tuesday after five days of combat that the red cross said killed more than 230 people. the saudi led coalition struck the city with 25 air strikes overnight, but u.n. and red cross aid flights were able to land at the airport, u.n. humanitarian coordinator in yemen jamie mcgoldrick said.  people are now emerging from their houses after five days being locked down basically as prisoners,  mcgoldrick told a u.n. briefing by phone from sanaa.  they are now seeking safety, moving their families in case things erupt again and at the same time seeking medical treatment and trying to pacify very terrified kids who have endured five days of relentless shelling, shooting and ground fire and air strikes.  the saudi cabinet, in a statement that did not mention saleh by name, said it hoped the sanaa uprising against the houthis would  help rid sisterly yemen of repression, death threats, ... explosions and seizure of private and public property . the death of saleh, who once compared ruling yemen to dancing on the heads of snakes, deepens the complexity of the multi sided war. much is likely to depend on the future allegiances of his loyalists, who had previously helped the armed houthi group, which hails from the zaidi branch of shi ite islam that ruled a thousand year kingdom in northern yemen until 1962. in a statement sent to reuters by an aide, his son said his father was killed at  the hands of the enemies of god and the country . ahmed ali said he would  confront the enemies of the homeland and humanity, who are trying to obliterate its identity and its gains and to humiliate yemen and yemenis . in an earlier statement carried by saudi state media, ahmed ali said he would lead  the battle until the last houthi is thrown out of yemen ... the blood of my father will be hell ringing in the ears of iran.  the arabian peninsula s poorest country, yemen is one of the most violent fronts in a proxy war between saudi arabia and iran, who have also backed opposing sides in syria, iraq and elsewhere across the middle east.  the saudi led coalition appears to have been counting on saleh s decision to switch sides to tip the balance of the war. saleh, who ruled in sanaa from 1978 2012, had a strong following in yemen, including army officers and armed tribal leaders who once served under him. during the years the ex president was allied to the houthis, yemeni political sources say ahmed ali was living incommunicado under house arrest at a guarded villa in the uae capital abu dhabi, where he had served as ambassador. the uae is a key member of the mostly gulf arab alliance that sees the houthis as a proxy of their arch enemy iran. the gulf countries had struggled to make gains against the houthi saleh alliance despite thousands of air strikes backed by western arms and intelligence. they have used their air and sea power to tightly restrict imports, action that the united nations says could lead to mass hunger. ahmed ali may be the family s last chance to win back influence. a nephew of the former leader, tareq mohammed abdullah saleh, a senior military commander, was also killed during clashes with the houthis, saleh s party said on tuesday. residents reported that fighting had subsided but that  saudi led coalition jets pounded several targets, including the downtown presidential palace where a governing body led by houthi saleh politicians had regularly convened. the houthi leader, abdul malek al houthi, hailed saleh s death in a speech on monday as a victory against a treasonous conspiracy by yemen s saudi enemies and called for tuesday s mass rally at a parade ground near the site of the air strikes. in the southern city of aden, where the saudi backed government is based, residents set off fireworks and expressed joy. saleh was hated throughout southern yemen after he launched a war to unify the country in 1994, lobbing ballistic missiles at the city. but his legacy is mixed. he is still loved in much of the north and many supporters will bear a grudge towards his killers. some feared saleh s death would only create more instability in yemen.  we expect things will get worse for us. this will be the beginning of a new conflict and more bloodshed. the war will not end soon,  said aswan abdu khalid, an academic at the psychology department at the university of aden.

" david stemerman is winding down his hedge fund firm to explore a run for governor of connecticut, according to a letter sent to clients of conatus capital management lp on tuesday. “connecticut – home to my family and business – is in crisis,” stemerman wrote in the note, which was viewed by reuters. “i am deeply concerned that a small number of people in our state are thriving while many are struggling to make ends meet,” the greenwich based republican added. “i do not claim to have all of the answers, but as an outsider with a fresh perspective, i believe that i can bring a different approach.”  the next election for governor in connecticut is in november 2018. the news was previously reported by bloomberg news. conatus started in 2008 with about $2.3 billion in assets under management and followed a classic fundamental stock selection strategy. the firm grew to manage about $3 billion by the start of 2014 but assets dropped to about $1.6 billion today, according to a person familiar with the situation.  conatus’ main hedge fund gained more than 18 percent this year through august, the person said. its average annual gain since inception was about 5.4 percent, according to bloomberg. stemerman also said in the letter that he planned to give startup money to a new fund planned by conatus consumer industry head amir mokari.

" president barack obama on friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of u.s. gay rights, the 1969 stonewall riots in new york city, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay americans. the stonewall inn gay bar in manhattan’s greenwich village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the american mainstream and guarantee their rights. “welcome to the family,” the national park service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site. lgbt rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities’ continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the june 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in florida that killed 49 people. “this new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate,” human rights campaign president chad griffin said. the move was the latest of several steps obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency.  in 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the u.s. military. in 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. his administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 u.s. supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. “there is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity,” obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site. the events of late june and early july 1969 in new york helped start the modern american gay rights movement. a week of violent clashes on christopher street between patrons of the stonewall inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the stonewall riots. the crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. but it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970. this year’s weekend lgbt pride festivities started in new york on friday with a street fair and were to culminate with sunday’s parade through lower manhattan. events were scheduled across the country in san francisco, minneapolis, oklahoma city and elsewhere. obama’s designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the stonewall inn and nearby christopher park. u.s. lawmakers representing new york, in a statement, called the site “a beacon for liberation.” it drew renewed attention in the wake of this month’s massacre in orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called pulse. mourners in new york flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern u.s. history.  in honor of the new monument, the white house will release a video that will be played on billboards in new york’s times square on saturday. u.s. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at stonewall on monday.

" the kremlin on wednesday dismissed allegations russia had hacked democratic party emails as “horror stories” dreamt up by u.s. politicians, saying it never interfered in other countries’ election campaigns. “moscow is at pains to avoid any words that could be interpreted as direct or indirect interference in the election process,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters. “... we see that the russian card is in the red corner on the writing table of all washington politicians during the election campaign, and that very often they make it a trump card in their game.” peskov was responding after u.s. president barack obama in an interview with nbc news said it was possible russia would try to influence the u.s. presidential election after a leak of democratic national committee emails that experts have blamed on russian hackers. “this reminds me of a company where they tell each other horror stories and then start being frightened of their own stories,” said peskov. the kremlin on tuesday said unidentified individuals in the united states were trying to cynically exploit fear of russia for electoral purposes.

" two wall street financial regulators would face cuts or major structural changes under president donald trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal according to an office of management and budget document on monday, the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau, which was created by the 2010 dodd frank reform law to protect borrowers from predatory lending, would undergo a “restructure.” this would reduce the federal deficit by $145 million in the 2018 fiscal year, it said. the securities and exchange commission, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund, established under dodd frank, used to supplement its budget. in recent years, the fund has been used to overhaul the sec’s information technology, including upgrades to the filing system for public companies and initiatives to help police fraud and track equities trading patterns. the white house document said the elimination of the fund would reduce the deficit by $50 million a year, which is the maximum amount the sec is allowed to deposit annually. currently, both the sec and cfpb budgets do not impact the federal deficit.  the cfpb’s $605.9 million budget is funded by the federal reserve, which is not subject to congressional appropriations.  congress does decide the sec’s $1.6 billion budget, but it is deficit neutral because the fees it collects from wall street firms are matched by the amount congress sets aside. the reserve fund, which is separate from the rest of the sec’s general budget, is funded through registration fees. an omb spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about how a restructuring of the cfpb or the elimination of the sec’s reserve fund would reduce the federal deficit. the cfpb’s structure has been under political fire for years.  republicans complain it is not held accountable because it is led by a single director who cannot be fired by the president at will, and it falls outside of congressional budget control. last year, a u.s. appeals court found the cfpb’s structure violated the u.s. constitution. the bureau is slated to fight that decision on wednesday, when the full panel of appellate judges will reconsider the ruling. legislation proposed recently by house republicans would subject the cfpb to appropriations. a report by the congressional budget office estimated that such a change could help reduce direct spending by $6.9 billion between 2018 2027. the sec’s reserve fund has long been a target of congressional republicans, who have led efforts to prevent the sec from using portions of the money. in july 2015, the sec’s inspector general predicted that a cancellation of the fund would stall it modernization and harm the agency.

" the bodies of 36 men found near the eastern libyan town of al abyar in october appear to have been summarily executed by armed groups loyal to khalifa haftar s libyan national army (lna), human rights watch said on wednesday. local police found the bodies on a main road about 50 km east of benghazi in an area controlled by the lna. shortly afterwards, the lna said it was launching an investigation. libya is divided between rival governments and armed factions. the lna controls most of the east, where haftar has expanded his power over the past three years, waging a long campaign against islamists and other opponents for control of benghazi.   haftar s buy in is seen as crucial for any effective political deal to unify the oil rich north african country, and he has been increasingly courted by western powers.  the bodies found near al abyar were the latest in a number of such cases in eastern libya.  relatives of six of the victims told hrw they had been seized from their homes on different dates by armed groups loyal to the lna in benghazi or other locations, the u.s. based group said in statement. all the relatives said that the victims bore gunshot wounds and had their hands tied behind their backs, and that families had been prevented from putting up tents outside their houses in benghazi to receive guests during a traditional three day mourning period, hrw added.  it cited a forensic investigator who reviewed pictures of 23 of the bodies as saying the injuries were consistent with executions at point blank range.   the libyan national army s pledges to conduct inquiries into repeated unlawful killings in areas under their control in eastern libya have so far led nowhere,  said eric goldstein, hrw s deputy middle east and north africa director.   the lna will be condoning apparent war crimes if their pledge to investigate the gruesome discovery in al abyar proves to be another empty promise.  an lna spokesman gave no immediate comment. the lna has said it is investigating the commander of an elite forces unit who is sought by the international criminal court (icc) for allegedly executing dozens of prisoners, though his exact whereabouts remain unclear.

"liberalism is truly a mental disorder. sadly, the children of these parents who are so consumed by hate, that they behave like schoolyard bullies, are going to be the ones who pay the price in the end kids tossing bean bags at a mock tombstone for president trump at a public school was a  despicable  display of dirty politics the adults forced on the unwitting children, a gloucester republican official said, as the furor continued to grow.school officials have apologized for a parent-teacher organization fundraiser last week at west parish elementary school   but one gop official fears the damage is already done. i don t think it s appropriate to put the sitting president s name on a tombstone. it s disrespectful to the office of the president, no matter who he is,  said amanda kesterson, who heads the gloucester republican city committee. unfortunately,  she told the herald,  in massachusetts in particular, where republicans are the minority party and the president is unpopular, i think there is a belief that joking about the president is acceptable   and it s not.   boston herald",1
" a malaysian state s royal council on thursday urged authorities to investigate former prime minister mahathir mohamad for sedition over his alleged insult to those who trace descent from the southeast asian region s ancient bugis seafaring community. over the past few weeks, mahathir, 93, has been sharply criticized for comments at an opposition rally last month where he is reported to have described prime minister najib razak as a  bugis pirate . mahathir s remarks about his former protege came in the context of alleged mismanagement of billions of dollars by state fund 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb), in which najib has denied all wrongdoing.  an investigation and legal action must be taken against dr mahathir under the sedition act, 1948, or any related laws,  the royal council of the western state of selangor said in a statement issued by its secretary, hanafisah jais. mahathir s comments at the rally were  excessive , it added, and could spark hatred for those of bugis ethnicity, besides which the speech  indirectly insults  the bugis lineage of the sultanate of selangor. selangor sultan sharafuddin idris shah urged all parties, particularly politicians, to avoid use of racial issues for political capital as this could disrupt harmony and unity, the statement said. the police were not immediately available for comment. mahathir s office did not immediately respond to a reuters  request for comment. the former prime minister last month said his criticism targeted only those of bugis ancestry who stole the people s money, news reports have said. a body representing malaysia s bugis community demanded that mahathir apologize and retract his statement, state news agency bernama said last month. thousands of malaysians rallied on oct. 14 in the finale of a two month long opposition roadshow aimed at convincing majority malay muslim voters in rural battleground areas that malaysia has suffered from najib s handling of 1mdb. najib has so far been able to weather the scandal, consolidating power by clamping down on dissenters and curbing domestic media and activists, even as he faces a fierce challenge from mahathir, who was prime minister for 22 years. but najib s popularity took a hit from persistent bad press linked to 1mdb, especially after the u.s. department of justice filed civil suits to recover more than $1.7 billion alleged to have been misappropriated from the 1mdb fund. originally seafarers who hailed from indonesia, the bugis community established sultanates on the malaysian peninsula. their malaysian descendants are considered to be part of the malay majority, that makes up more than half of malaysia s population of nearly 33 million.

" the top democrat on the senate finance committee asked the government ethics watchdog on monday to review comments by treasury secretary steven mnuchin plugging “the lego batman movie,” a film one of his companies produced, for a possible ethics violation. in a letter to office of government ethics director walter shaub, senator ron wyden said he was concerned that mnuchin had violated his ethics agreement signed in january in his comments on friday at the end of a live interview with the axios news website. mnuchin had agreed to divest his interests in ratpac dune entertainment holdings llc within 120 days of his confirmation, and “not participate personally and substantially in any matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of the entity” unless first obtaining a waiver. ratpac dune, co founded by mnuchin with producer director brett rattner and media billionaire james packer, has produced and financed a number of hollywood hits in recent years, including “avatar,” “mad max: fury road” and “the lego batman movie.” at the axios event, mnuchin was asked in a question from a reader for a movie recommendation. “i’m not allowed to promote anything that i’m involved in.  so i just want to have the legal disclosure, you’ve asked me the question, and i am not promoting any product,” mnuchin said. “but you should send all your kids to ‘lego batman.’” the comment drew laughter from the audience at the washington event. wyden said the finance committee had received no notifications regarding mnuchin’s holdings in ratpac dune and assumed the treasury chief still held that interest. “i am concerned that sec. mnuchin’s comments, may be seen to have a predictable effect on the financial interests” of ratpac dune, wyden said in his letter. in a statement, a treasury spokesman said: “as his statement reflects, the secretary clearly recognized that he generally may not promote private interests and specifically gave the legal disclosure that he was not promoting a movie, but answering a question he was asked directly.” the oge recommended last month that the white house should consider disciplinary action against president donald trump’s adviser kellyanne conway for her on air comment on fox news channel promoting the clothing and jewelry line of trump’s daughter ivanka trump. conway said people “should go buy ivanka’s stuff.” the white house later told the ethics watchdog that conway had acted “inadvertently” and without “nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally.” ",0
" the united states suggested on tuesday it could cut u.s. aid to pakistan or downgrade islamabad s status as a major non nato ally to pressure the south asian nation to do more to help it with the war in afghanistan. a day after president donald trump committed to an open ended conflict in afghanistan and singled out pakistan for harboring afghan taliban insurgents and other militants, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said washington s relationship with pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism.  we are going to be conditioning our support for pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,  tillerson told reporters.  u.s. officials are frustrated by what they see as pakistan s reluctance to act against groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring afghanistan. pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting u.s. and afghan government forces in afghanistan. tillerson said the united states could consider withdrawing pakistan s status as a major non nato ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u.s. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve.  we have some leverage that s been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non nato alliance partner   all of that can be put on the table,  he said. in a televised speech on monday offering few specifics, trump promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government and he singled out pakistan for harboring militants. u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america s longest military conflict.   (for a graphic on u.s. troops and contractors in afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6cxq)  the afghan government welcomed trump s speech, but the taliban said it would make the country a  graveyard for the american empire.      successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan, which has a porous border with afghanistan. washington fumes about inaction against the taliban, but pakistan has cooperated on other u.s. counterterrorism efforts, including against al qaeda and islamic state militants. the pakistani foreign ministry said it was  disappointing that the us policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the pakistani nation  in fighting terrorism.   as a matter of policy, pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,  it said.      a senior u.s. official said on tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. trump also called for pakistan s great rival india to play a bigger role in afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for pakistan s generals.      trump s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,  said zahid hussain, a pakistani security analyst. the united states has little choice but to use pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan, giving islamabad considerable leverage. u.s. officials fret that if pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize afghanistan and endanger u.s. soldiers.     defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the u.s. military s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, general joseph dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to afghanistan.  when he brings that to me, i will determine how many more we need to send in,  mattis told reporters in baghdad.  it may or may not be the number that is bandied about.  u.s. officials have said trump has given mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in afghanistan. the u.s. air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following trump s decision, its top general told reuters on tuesday. most u.s. troops in afghanistan work with a nato led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al qaeda and islamic state fighters.

" the kremlin said on monday that u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson will not meet president vladimir putin when he visits moscow on wednesday, a move that could point to tensions over a u.s. missile attack on a syrian air base last week. john kerry, tillerson’s predecessor, often met putin as well as the russian foreign minister when he visited moscow, and putin granted several audiences to the texan when he ran oil major exxon mobil before taking his current job. putin even personally awarded tillerson a top russian state award — the order of friendship — in 2013, and it was widely expected that the former oilman would meet putin on what is his first trip to russia as secretary of state. but putin’s spokesman, dmitry peskov, told reporters on monday that no such meeting was planned, suggesting tillerson will follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov. “we have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with tillerson in the president’s diary,” peskov told reporters on a conference call. he did not say why putin was not planning to receive tillerson. u.s. president donald trump ordered a missile strike on a syrian military base last week in retaliation for what washington and its allies say was a poisonous gas attack in which scores of civilians were killed. moscow says there is no proof that the syrian military carried out the attack, and called the u.s. missile strike an act of aggression that violates international law.   tillerson’s visit is being seen as an early test of whether trump’s new administration can use any momentum generated by striking the syrian base to craft and execute a strategy to end the war there. even before trump ordered the strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, tillerson’s visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues. those include alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, washington’s accusation that russia is violating an important arms control treaty, and trying to bridge differences on how to conduct the fight against islamic state. syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed moscow and washington might be able to find common ground. peskov, putin’s spokesman, said on monday that the u.s. strikes had shown washington’s total unwillingness to cooperate on syria. reacting to media reports that tillerson would use his visit to press moscow to back away from supporting syrian president bashar al assad, russia’s biggest middle east ally, peskov signaled that was a non starter. “returning to pseudo attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that assad must step down cannot help sort things out.” ",0

" president elect donald trump and some of silicon valley’s most powerful executives met at his manhattan tower on wednesday, a summit convened to smooth over frictions after both sides made no secret of their disdain for each other during the election campaign. the meeting focused chiefly on economic issues, including job creation, lowering taxes and trade dynamics with china, while largely skirting the many disagreements the tech industry has with trump on matters ranging from immigration to digital privacy, according to a trump transition team statement.      trump proposed reconvening with the tech leaders as often as every quarter, the statement said. three of trump’s adult children, donald jr., eric and ivanka, sat at the head of a large rectangular table as the meeting began in a conference room on the 25th floor of trump tower. their attendance may fuel further concern about potential conflicts of interests for trump, who has said he would hand over control of his business empire to his children while he occupies the white house. vice president elect mike pence was also there. guests sat in front of paper name plates and bottles of water sporting the trump brand logo.  the meeting between tech luminaries, including apple inc’s tim cook, facebook inc’s sheryl sandberg and tesla motors inc’s elon musk, took place as trump has alarmed some u.s. corporations with his rhetoric challenging long established policy toward china, a main market for silicon valley. a senior chinese state planning official told the china daily newspaper wednesday that beijing could slap a penalty on a u.s. automaker for monopolistic behavior, a warning delivered  days after trump questioned acknowledging taiwan as part of “one china.”  the official did not identify the automaker. “there’s nobody like the people in this room, and anything we can do to help this go along we’re going to do that for you,” trump told the executives in the presence of reporters. “you call my people, you call me, it doesn’t make any difference. we have no formal chain of command.” trump added: “we’re going to make fair trade deals. we’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.” other participants included alphabet inc’s larry page and eric schmidt, amazon.com’s jeff bezos, microsoft corp’s satya nadella, and ginni rometty from ibm.      twitter was not invited to the meeting because it was too small, a transition spokesman told reuters. cook and musk joined trump for separate meetings after the other technology executives leave, according to a spokesman for trump’s transition team. bezos said in a statement the meeting was “very productive” and that he “shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech   agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing  everywhere.” trump clashed with silicon valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption, and his surprise victory last month alarmed many companies that feared he might follow through on his pledges. he has said that many tech companies are overvalued by investors. “you look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and they’re selling for so much money,” he told reuters in an interview in may. those concerns have not been assuaged in recent weeks as trump has threatened to upset trade relationships with china and appoint officials who favor expanded surveillance programs.   “for some of the companies, there was some hesitation about whether to attend” because of sharp political and personal differences with trump, one tech industry source said. more than 700 employees of technology companies pledged in an open letter on tuesday to refuse to help trump’s administration build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations. silicon valley enjoyed a warm rapport with president barack obama and heavily supported democrat hillary clinton during the presidential campaign.  alphabet’s schmidt was photographed on election night at clinton headquarters wearing a staff badge, and musk said in interviews before the election that trump’s character reflected poorly on the united states. despite those tensions, trump named musk to a business advisory council that will give private sector input to trump after he takes office on jan. 20. the ceos of airbnb and uber were invited but did not attend wednesday’s gathering. uber’s travis kalanick, traveling in india all week according to a person familiar with his plans, was also appointed to the council. from the employees of the 10 largest fortune 500 tech companies, trump raised just $179,400 from 982 campaign donors who contributed more than $200. clinton raised $4.4 million from the employees of the same companies, with more than 20,400 donations, a reuters review of contribution data found.  trump publicly bashed the industry during the campaign. he urged his supporters to boycott apple products over the company’s refusal to help the fbi unlock an iphone associated with last year’s san bernardino, california, shootings, threatened antitrust action against amazon and demanded that tech companies build their products in the united states. trump has also been an opponent of the obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing consumer access to web content. two advisers to his federal communications commission transition team are opponents of the rules, as are the two republicans on the fcc.  last week, the two republicans on the panel urged a quick reversal of many obama policies and one, commissioner ajit pai, said he believed that net neutrality’s “days are numbered.” ",0
" wisconsin’s republican controlled state assembly voted 59 30 on thursday to approve a bill that paves the way for a $3 billion incentives package for a proposed liquid crystal display plant by taiwan’s foxconn. the plan still needs to be approved by the joint finance committee, which has members from both the assembly and the state senate, as well as the senate before it can go to the governor. the finance committee and senate are also controlled by republicans.  foxconn, an electronics manufacturer formally known as hon hai precision industry co ltd (2317.tw), hopes to open a $10 billion plant in 2020 at a 1,000 acre site in southeastern wisconsin. foxconn is a major supplier to apple inc (aapl.o) for its iphones. “we are ready to take advantage of this historic opportunity ... and build a long lasting relationship with foxconn,” wisconsin governor scott walker, a republican who helped negotiate the deal, said in a statement. walker ordered the legislature into special session on aug. 1 to consider the incentives package, which would award foxconn $3 billion over 15 years in mostly cash incentives. foxconn, walker, president donald trump and other leaders announced the deal on the incentives last month in a white house ceremony. the 20 million square foot lcd plant would initially employ 3,000 people, but walker and foxconn said the company could ultimately employ 13,000 at the site. “we look forward to continuing to work with them to transform wisconsin’s economy and make it a center of worldwide high tech manufacturing,” foxconn said in a statement, referring to the legislature. proponents have touted the project’s investment potential and job creation, including an expected 22,000 ancillary and 10,000 construction jobs. critics including some democrats have attacked the plan as corporate welfare, too expensive, rushed and potentially harmful to the environment. “i think we need more time,” democratic representative jill billings said. “i want a better deal and more guarantees for my taxpayers.” thursday’s vote did not follow strict party lines; three democrats voted in favor and two republicans voted against.  early in a debate that lasted several hours, democrats proposed referring the matter to the finance committee for review, which would have stopped the debate. the assembly rejected the proposal with a 57 32 vote. the assembly also voted to ignore three amendments proposed by democrats.  wisconsin would not break even on the incentive package for at least 25 years, a legislative analysis released last week said.

" australia s high court rejected two legal challenges on thursday against a proposed postal ballot on whether to legalize same sex marriage, clearing the way for a vote on an issue that has wide support but which has also threatened to divide the government. australians will now begin voting in the non compulsory ballot as early as next week, with a result expected some time in november. the court s decision to reject the legal challenges, both of which argued that the center right government needed the support of parliament to hold the ballot, comes as a welcome relief for prime minister malcolm turnbull. turnbull supports same sex marriage, as do two thirds of australians, but his government holds a razor thin majority and more conservative elements in his liberal national coalition have used the issue to threaten his leadership. some conservative lawmakers threatened to resign if the court ruled against the proposal, while more liberal members said they would side with the labor opposition to secure same sex marriage before turnbull offered the postal vote as an alternative. a rejection would have led to increased pressure on turnbull to hold a vote in parliament, which has already twice rejected a national ballot.  every australian can have a say and we can, as a commonwealth of australia, embrace this important social change,  turnbull told parliament in canberra after the court s decision was announced. turnbull has said australia s marriage act would be changed by the end of the year if the public backed same sex marriage in the postal ballot. although the court s verdict provides a viable pathway to same sex marriage, advocates fear an escalation in an already vitriolic campaign. turnbull called for mutual respect last month as the issue gathered heat. opponents of same sex marriage launched a contentious  no  campaign advertisement last week that the government immediately rejected as inaccurate. activists fear a surge in malicious campaigning for the ballot, which is not a formal election and is therefore not subject to the usual rules on political advertisements. many supporters of same sex marriage in australia had backed the legal challenges, insisting that the campaign would hurt people who were already vulnerable, but said they would now support the ballot.  we now get out there and campaign long and hard for a  yes  vote,  alex greenwich, co chair of australian marriage equality, told reporters in melbourne.  when we win this, we can all come together, having finally achieved marriage equality.

" legal advocacy groups seeking to challenge president donald trump in court over alleged conflicts of interest said filing lawsuits is part of a larger strategy to highlight their concerns and put political pressure on the white house. in a lawsuit on monday, ethics watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington contended payments to trump’s businesses for hotel rooms and office leases run afoul of the emoluments clause of the constitution, which forbids u.s. officeholders from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  trump on monday called the lawsuit “without merit,” and legal experts have noted significant barriers to success in court, such as whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue.  the american civil liberties union is also preparing a lawsuit over trump’s alleged violations of the emoluments clause, said aclu executive director anthony romero. beyond winning favorable rulings, cases can serve to “gum up the machinery of the government and rob the trump administration of momentum,” he said.  lawsuits can also serve to frame the public debate and gain the attention of congress and government officials, romero said.  “this should be an area where we let a thousand legal flowers bloom,” he told reuters on tuesday.  laurence tribe, one of the attorneys representing crew, said the purpose of its lawsuit was to force trump to abide by the constitution, and that he felt confident they would achieve a favorable outcome in court.  he also said bringing the case can accomplish other goals.  “one of the things that this lawsuit will achieve is increased public understanding of what the issue is,” he said. aside from the emoluments clause, conflict of interest laws that govern the executive branch generally do not apply to the president or vice president, said erwin chemerinsky, dean of uc irvine school of law and another of crew’s lawyers. presidents largely enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties.  the office of government ethics sets policy for executive branch employees, but it does not investigate complaints or bring lawsuits. if oge officials find evidence of wrongdoing, they refer it to the department of justice for civil or criminal prosecution.   crew also filed a complaint with the general services administration over trump’s hotel in washington d.c., which he leases from the federal government. the complaint alleges the business violates the terms of the lease, which says it cannot be held by an elected officeholder. it is unclear whether that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts.  federal courts maintain strict rules about who has the legal right, or standing, to sue. the u.s. department of justice will likely raise a standing challenge to crew’s case in the form of a motion to dismiss, said deepak gupta, another attorney representing the group.  a spokeswoman for the department of justice said it is reviewing the complaint and would respond as appropriate.  in its lawsuit, crew argued that it should be allowed to bring the emoluments case because it has been forced to spend money and divert resources away from its traditional agenda of tracking campaign contributions and ethics monitoring. legal experts have said that will be a difficult argument to win. tribe, a professor at harvard law school, said crew felt confident it would win on standing. he also noted that additional plaintiffs “have expressed interest in bringing litigation, either as part of our case or others.” he declined to identify them or discuss strategy details. romero also said the aclu is seeking a “suitable plaintiff.” andy grewal, a professor at the university of iowa college of law, said that adding a plaintiff with more concrete allegations, such as a hotel that claims it has lost business to trump’s hotels, would still be an uphill battle.  it would be hard to prove, for instance, that a diplomat would have stayed at another hotel instead of trump’s, he said. ultimately, no court has determined whether ownership by a president or government official of a corporation that sells products to a foreign government would violate the constitution, he said, and that could present an additional barrier to success.

" from an argument over dog poo to an alleged anti semitic caricature he posted on facebook, yair netanyahu, the israeli prime minister s 26 year old son, is courting controversy with his social media activity. the criticism of netanyahu in israel is turning into a sideshow to more weighty events: criminal investigations into corruption allegations against his father and mother. they both deny any wrongdoing. the young netanyahu is widely seen in israel as being groomed by his parents as a future political leader and the facebook posts have attracted particular public interest. on saturday, he posted a cartoon using what the anti defamation league, which monitors anti semitism worldwide, described as anti semitic imagery in a facebook post mocking some of his father s critics. it included a depiction of u.s. billionaire george soros at the top of a food chain, dangling the world in front of both a reptile and former prime minister ehud barak, a frequent critic of netanyahu. jewish financiers controlling the world is a well known anti semitic theme. soros supports left wing and human rights organizations that have been highly critical of israel and its treatment of palestinians. the israel office of the anti defamation league denounced the cartoon on twitter, writing:  the caricature posted by yair netanyahu includes explicit anti semitic elements. one cannot belittle the danger inherent in an anti semitic discourse.  in further facebook posts following criticism for posting  the cartoon, yair netanyahu, who is a university student, condemned the israeli left for being two faced in trying to silence him. a family spokesman said yair netanyahu would not be making any other comment. the prime minister refused to ask questions from reporters about the post on sunday morning at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting. last month, the son made another headline grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the u.s. state of virginia.  it appeared to suggest that hard left organizations now pose more of a danger than neo nazi groups, which he wrote are a dying breed. in july, netanyahu junior found himself in a bizarre social media row over dog poo. a neighbor of the family said on facebook that yair, who lives with his parents, responded with an obscene gesture and walked away after she had asked him to clean up the mess left by the dog he was walking in a park. the post went viral. a family spokesman said at the time that the woman had behaved aggressively and  yair does not know if kaiya (the dog) did defecate as (she) alleges . some critics in israel suggested netanyahu s online activities were meant to deflect attention from his parent s legal troubles.      on friday, israel s attorney general said he was considering indicting sara netanyahu on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. benjamin netanyahu, who has served as prime minister for 11 years, spread over four terms, is being investigated by police in two corruption cases.

" the democratic party released a video on sunday slamming republican presidential hopefuls for their opposition to action on climate change, suggesting the views clash with the reality of rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns. the video features republican front runner donald trump and his two closest rivals, marco rubio and ted cruz, denying man made global warming, juxtaposed with images of u.s. flooding, wildfires, droughts and heat waves. “i’m not a believer in climate change,” trump says during a television news interview featured in the clip. the video can be seen at bit.ly/1qm5ib8.  “satellite data show there’s been no warming whatsoever,” cruz, a u.s. senator of texas, says in another news clip. rubio, a u.s. senator of florida, says, “i do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.”     the video aims to put the environmental issue center stage in the november race for the white house.      democratic presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and bernie sanders have both laid out plans to combat climate change, while all five republican presidential contenders have argued that the problem doesn’t exist or have discounted the scope of the issue. the video also draws a link between environmental issues and the vacancy on the u.s. supreme court following the surprise death this month of justice antonin scalia.  president barack obama has said he plans to nominate a replacement for scalia before the november election, but republicans in congress have vowed to block the effort. “with so many issues at stake now, with so much potentially heading before the court on clean energy and climate change, we simply can’t afford for our nation’s highest court to be crippled,” a few democratic members of congress say in the video. an official for the democratic party said the video would be circulated on social media.

" honduras  two main opposition parties on friday presented formal requests to annul the results of the still unresolved presidential election, deepening a political crisis that has roiled the poor, violent central american nation. the nov. 26 vote has been marred by accusations of electoral fraud, sparking protests, a widespread curfew and a growing chorus of international concern over the situation in honduras, which has one of the world s highest murder rates.  opposition leader salvador nasralla, who trails conservative president juan orlando hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the widely criticized official count, arrived at the election tribunal shortly before the midnight deadline to present his center left coalition s request.   we re asking for the result to be declared null at the presidential level, due to the scandalous fraud we have discovered,  nasralla said.  earlier, octavio pineda, the secretary of the third placed liberal party, presented a similar document, saying the vote should be annulled due to a violation of constitutional norms.  there have been violations since the president of the republic was allowed to participate in the electoral process when the constitution prohibited it,  pineda said. the liberal party s candidate, luis zelaya, has repeatedly said nasralla won the election. hernandez s bid for a second term, which was made possible by a 2015 supreme court decision on term limits, divided opinion in the coffee exporting nation of 9 million people. the election has been plagued with problems since voting stations closed.  the tribunal declared nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. however, it gave no further updates for about 36 hours. once results then started flowing again, nasralla s lead quickly started narrowing, sparking a major outcry.  on thursday, tribunal chief david matamoros said there would be a re count of 4,753 ballot boxes that arrived after the 36 hour pause, and which the opposition has claimed are tainted. the oas, which on wednesday said it may call for new  elections if  irregularities  undermine the credibility of results, had previously called for a recount of those 4,753 ballot boxes.  marlon ochoa, nasralla s campaign manager, reiterated that the coalition wants a full recount of the complete 18,000 odd ballot boxes. on wednesday, nasralla said he no longer recognized the honduran tribunal because of its role in the process. the tribunal has 10 days to respond to the requests.

" u.s. president donald trump s daughter ivanka trump kicked off a global business summit in southern india on tuesday calling for better opportunities for women entrepreneurs battling heavy odds around the world. ivanka, also an informal adviser to her father, received a warm welcome in india s high tech hub of hyderabad with all the trappings of a state guest.  prime minister narendra modi joined her in the opening of the u.s. backed global entrepreneurship summit which new delhi is hoping will further boost political and economic ties with the united states under the trump administration.  ivanka, wearing a bright green floral dress, said fuelling the growth of women led businesses and closing the gender entrepreneurship gap could help expand global gdp by 2 percent.   women still face steep obstacles to starting, owning and growing their businesses. we must ensure women entrepreneurs have access to capital, access to networks and mentors,  ivanka said to loud cheers from a packed audience in a heavily guarded conference center.  in developing countries, 70 percent of women owned smaller businesses were being denied access to capital, she said, leading to a near $300 billion annual credit deficit for them. ges is an event conceived by former u.s. president barack obama. it has previously been held in countries such as the united states and turkey, but this year s edition is the first under the trump administration.     the theme of the conference this year is  women first, prosperity for all . more than half the participants at the summit are women, and all female delegations are representing countries such as afghanistan, israel and saudi arabia. ivanka, who ran an eponymous clothing and jewelry business before becoming an adviser in the white house, has made women s issues one of her main policy areas. she cited a harvard business review report that found that in the united states investors ask men questions about their potential for gains, whereas they ask women questions about their potential for loss. billboards with pictures of ivanka dotted many parts of hyderabad which is also home to major u.s. firms such as microsoft (msft.o). in recent days, authorities took beggars off city streets in a clean up drive before the meeting, media said. more than 10,000 police officials were deployed in the city and sniffer dogs as well as  spotters , or men trained to detect any suspicious activity or people, were on stand by, a police officer said.  on the sidelines, ivanka held talks with modi, as well as indian foreign minister sushma swaraj. later she toured the conference center with modi and met a few entrepreneurs, before watching traditional indian dance performances in the inaugural session.  this event not only connects the silicon valley with hyderabad but also show cases the close ties between the united states of america and india. it underlines our shared commitment toward encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation,  modi said. india has become a major market for the united states, with two way trade of about $115 billion last year. they aim to raise that to $500 billion by 2022. military and strategic ties are also improving as china s influence rises in asia and beyond.  the trump administration sees india as a strategic partner and wants to engage with india more. when you look at sending of ivanka trump, it is sending a very strong signal,  said mukesh aghi, president of the us india strategic partnership forum.

" u.s. senator john mccain on monday called for president donald trump to release any evidence supporting his claim the obama administration wiretapped him while probing russia’s influence in the 2016 election.  “i think the president of the united states, if he has any information that would indicate that his predecessor wiretapped trump tower, then he should come forward with that information. the american people deserve it,” mccain, a republican from arizona, told reuters. jason chaffetz, a republican lawmaker who heads the u.s. house of representatives oversight and government reform committee, told cbs in an interview on monday that he had “not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said.” republican senator lindsey graham, who heads the senate judiciary subcommittee looking into allegations russia meddled in the election, said the panel would be asking both federal bureau of investigation director james comey and the justice department whether he had told the law enforcement agency this weekend to reject trump’s wire tapping claim. the white house said on monday that trump still has confidence in comey despite his assertiveness in challenging trump’s claim that the administration of former president barack obama had wiretapped him. asked whether trump still had confidence in comey, white house spokesman sean spicer said, “there’s nothing that i have been told by him that would lead me to believe that anything is different than what it was prior.” he was “almost 100 percent certain” trump had not spoken to comey since the republican president made the allegation on twitter on saturday. “i’m not aware that that occurred,” spicer told reporters. but, when asked during an early morning interview on monday with abc’s “good morning america” whether trump accepted comey’s assertion, white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said, “i don’t think he does.” the fbi declined to comment on comey’s communications.    trump has given no evidence for his claim that trump tower was wiretapped. the allegation is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between trump associates and russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency.  the wiretapping allegation hit u.s. stocks on monday. some investors worried that the affair could distract trump from his economic agenda of introducing tax cuts and simplifying regulations that has powered a record setting rally on wall street since the election.   the lack of detail on trump’s proposals, his isolationist stance and setbacks in filling his cabinet have made investors question whether the post election rally has run its course.        democrats accused trump of making the wiretapping claim to try to distract from controversy about possible links to russia. his administration is facing fbi and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and russian officials.     the white house has asked the republican controlled congress to examine, as part of an ongoing congressional probe into russia’s influence on the election, whether the obama administration abused its investigative authority.

" this remote town in peru s southern andes was supposed to serve as a model for how companies can help communities uprooted by mining. named nueva fuerabamba, it was built to house around 1,600 people who gave up their village and farmland to make room for a massive, open pit copper mine. the new hamlet boasts paved streets and tidy houses with electricity and indoor plumbing, once luxuries to the indigenous quechua speaking people who now call this place home. the mine s operator, mmg ltd, the melbourne based unit of state owned china minmetals corp, threw in jobs and enough cash so that some villagers no longer work. but the high profile deal has not brought the harmony sought by villagers or mmg, a testament to the difficulty in averting mining disputes in this mineral rich nation. resource battles are common in latin america, but tensions are particularly high in peru, the world s no. 2 producer of copper, zinc and silver. peasant farmers have revolted against an industry that many see as damaging their land and livelihoods while denying them a fair share of the wealth. peru is home to 167 social conflicts, most related to mining, according to the national ombudsman s office, whose mission includes defusing hostilities. nueva fuerabamba was the centerpiece of one of the most generous mining settlements ever negotiated in peru. but three years after moving in, many transplants are struggling amid their suburban style conveniences, reuters interviews with two dozen residents showed. many miss their old lives growing potatoes and raising livestock. some have squandered their cash settlements. idleness and isolation have dulled the spirits of a people whose ancestors were feared cattle rustlers.  it is like we are trapped in a jail, in a cage where little animals are kept,  said cipriano lima, 43, a former farmer. meanwhile, the mine, known as las bambas, has remained a magnet for discontent. clashes between demonstrators and authorities in 2015 and 2016 left four area men dead. nueva fuerabamba residents have blocked copper transport roads to press for more financial help from mmg. the company acknowledged the transition has been difficult for some villagers, but said most have benefited from improved housing, healthcare and education.  nueva fuerabamba has experienced significant positive change,  troy hey, mmg s executive general manager of stakeholder relations, said in an email to reuters. mmg said it spent  hundreds of millions  on the relocation effort. mining is the driver of peru s economy, which has averaged 5.5 percent annual growth over the past decade. still, pitched conflicts have derailed billions of dollars worth of investment in recent years, including projects by newmont mining corp and southern copper corp. to defuse opposition, president pablo kuczynski has vowed to boost social services in rural highland areas, where nearly half of residents live in poverty. but moving from conflict to cooperation is not easy after centuries of mistrust. relocations are particularly fraught, according to camilo leon, a mining resettlement specialist at the pontifical catholic university of peru. subsistence farmers have struggled to adapt to the loss of their traditions and the  very urban, very organized  layout of planned towns, leon said.  it is generally a shock for rural communities,  leon said. at least six proposed mines have required relocations in peru in the past decade, leon said. later this month, peru will tender a $2 billion copper project, michiquillay, which would require moving yet another village. mmg inherited the nueva fuerabamba project when it bought las bambas from switzerland s glencore plc in 2014 for $7 billion. under terms of a deal struck in 2009 and reviewed by reuters, villagers voted to trade their existing homes and farmland for houses in a new community. heads of each household, about 500 in all, were promised mining jobs. university scholarships would be given to their children. residents were to receive new land for farming and grazing, albeit in a parcel four hours away by car. cash was an added sweetener. villagers say each household got 400,000 soles ($120,000), which amounts to a lifetime s earnings for a minimum wage worker in peru. mmg declined to confirm the payments, saying its agreements are confidential. built into a hillside 15 miles from the las bambas mine, nueva fuerabamba was the product of extensive community input, mmg said. amenities include a hospital, soccer fields and a cement bull ring for festivals. but some residents say the deal has not been the windfall they hoped. their new two and three story houses, made of drywall, are drafty and appear flimsy compared to their old thatched roof adobe cottages heated by wood fired stoves, some said. many no longer plant crops or tend livestock because their replacement plots are too far away. jobs provided by mmg mostly involve maintaining the town because most residents lack the skills to work in a modern mine. many villagers spent their settlements unwisely, said community president alfonso vargas.  some invested in businesses but others did not. they went drinking,  he said. now basics like water, food and fuel   once wrested from the land   must be paid for.  everything is money,  margot portilla, 20, said as she cooked rice on a gas stove in her sister in law s bright yellow home.  before we could make a fire for cooking with cow dung. now we have to buy gas.  some residents said they have benefited from the move. the new town is cleaner than the old village, said betsabe mendoza, 25. she invested her settlement in a metalworking business in a bigger town. portilla, the young mom, says her younger sisters are getting a better education than she did. still, the streets of nueva fuerabamba were virtually deserted on a recent weekday. vargas, the community leader, said many residents have returned to the countryside or sought work elsewhere. alcoholism, fueled by idle time and settlement money, is on the rise, he said. some villagers have committed suicide. over the 12 months through july, four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals, according to the provincial district attorney s office. it could not provide data on suicides in the old village of fuerabamba. mmg, citing an  independent  study done prior to the relocation, said the community previously suffered from high rates of domestic violence, alcoholism, illiteracy and poverty. while the company considers the new town a success, it acknowledged the transition has not been easy for all.  connection to land, livelihood restoration and simple adaptation to new living conditions remain a challenge,  mmg said. nueva fuerabamba residents continue pressuring the company for additional assistance. demands include more jobs and deeds to their houses, which have yet to be delivered because of bureaucratic delays, said godofredo huamani, the community s lawyer. mmg said it stays apace of community needs through town hall meetings and has representatives on hand to field complaints. while villagers fret about the future, many cling to the past. flora huamani, 39, a mother of four girls, recalled how women used to get together to weave wool from their own sheep into the embroidered black dresses they wear.  those were our traditions,  said huamani from a bench in her walled front yard.  now our tradition is meeting after meeting after meeting  to discuss the community s problems. graphic:

" a country’s spending on development aid and on defense are separate items, nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said on friday, responding to german comments about nato’s target for increasing military budgets. german foreign minister sigmar gabriel had said on thursday that it was not realistic for germany to spend 2 percent of its economic output on defense and that other spending, such as development aid, should be taken into consideration. “diplomacy, development aid, economic cooperation can be important to help stabilize a region,” stoltenberg told a news conference in brussels. “we have international targets, guidelines, for development aid, 0.7 percent of gdp and then we have a nato agreement on moving toward 2 percent. but those are two different things, even though both are important,” he added. “it is not either development or security, it is development and security and the foundation of development is to have peace and security.” ",0

" planned parenthood filed a lawsuit against ohio officials on wednesday over a plan by the state to restrict the u.s. healthcare agency’s access to state and federal funds, saying it was being singled out for providing abortion services. the lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of planned parenthood branches of greater ohio and of the southwest region, said attempts to defund the healthcare agency and several affiliated programs were an “extreme punishment” exacted solely because abortion services are part of its range of care, court filings showed. agency officials also said such actions violated the equal protection clause of the u.s. constitution for singling out planned parenthood and treating it differently from other healthcare providers. ohio right to life director katie franklin called the lawsuit “frivolous.” the ohio bill was signed by governor john kasich in february and bars the state from contracts with organizations that perform or promote abortions. it is set to take effect on may 23. kasich’s press secretary, joe andrews, said in an email he would not discuss pending litigation, but added the governor, a former republican presidential candidate, was pleased to sign legislation “that continued our progress in moving funding to other eligible providers.” the lawsuit is the 15th filed by planned parenthood over access to care at its centers since mid 2015, when anti abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue. planned parenthood denied wrongdoing and said the videos were distorted and politically motivated. officials in 12 states have since blocked efforts to cut funding from the clinics, and the federal director of medicaid, a government healthcare program for the poor, warned states in april against cutting off funds to planned parenthood simply because its services include abortions. planned parenthood officials said they were asking the court to hand down an order before the law takes effect. if allowed to continue, the action would “constitute an undue, constitutionally intolerable burden on the abortion rights of ohio women,” the filing said. also on wednesday, kansas governor sam brownback signed into law a bill that directs the state’s spending of federal funds for family planning services to health centers and hospitals that provide a full range of healthcare.  the governor’s office said in a statement the bill would eliminate funding for planned parenthood clinics out of federal grants for family planning programs.

" chile will continue to pursue trade deals even though the trans pacific partnership (tpp) is off the table after u.s. president donald trump withdrew the united states from the pact, foreign minister heraldo munoz told journalists on monday. munoz said that while another regional trade deal without the united states might be possible, “it wouldn’t be the tpp.” the south american country has invited ministers from other tpp members as well as china and south korea to a summit in chile in march to discuss how to proceed, and has received positive responses at a high level, munoz said. “the tpp as it was going forward is off the table. that doesn’t mean that chile is going to change tack. we are going to persist in the opening up of the world ... as we did in the past, with bilateral deals, and regional deals,” he said. top copper exporter chile has a small but open economy, with existing free trade deals with all the other tpp members. earlier on monday, trump fulfilled a campaign promise by formally withdrawing the united states from the tpp, a 12 nation project that had been negotiated by former democratic president barack obama’s administration but never approved by congress. mexico said it would immediately seek bilateral deals with other countries that signed the tpp. ",0
" a 2014 new hampshire law prohibiting voters from taking selfies with their ballots on election day is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to free speech, a federal appeals court ruled on wednesday. the new england state had banned the practice, which has become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates, claiming that it would set the stage for a return of the vote buying scandals that rocked many u.s. states in the 19th century. three new hampshire citizens, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 republican primary for the u.s. senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated their rights to free expression, as protected by the first amendment of the u.s. constitution. a federal court in new hampshire sided with them, but the state appealed, making its case in boston just two weeks ago. the appeals court swiftly rejected its arguments. “the statute’s purposes cannot justify the restrictions it imposes on speech,” circuit judge sandra lynch wrote in the court’s decision. new hampshire’s argument that ballot selfies could lead to people selling their votes or being compelled by their employers to vote in a certain way fell short in no small part because the state had no evidence of that actually happening, lynch wrote. “the legislative history of the bill does not contain any corroborated evidence of vote buying or voter coercion in new hampshire during the 20th and 21st centuries,” she wrote. “digital photography, the internet, and social media are not unknown quantities — they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles, without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation.” lynch also noted that several federal and state laws in effect in new hampshire already make it illegal to buy or sell a vote, which would allow prosecutors to take on allegations of election tampering even in an environment where selfies were permitted. other states, including nearby rhode island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, partly reasoning that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

" the state department, which was criticized for former secretary of state hillary clinton’s use of a private email server, said on wednesday it failed to meet an end of 2016 deadline to manage all its email records electronically. the department, and other u.s. government agencies, had more than four years to meet the deadline under an aug. 24, 2012, directive that aimed to eliminate the use of paper records as much as possible in favor of electronic record keeping. that directive was part of an obama administration effort to update government record keeping for the digital age and promote accountability for official decisions by ensuring they are properly documented and preserved for future generations. in a report posted by the national archives on wednesday, the state department checked the “no” box in response to a question on whether it had met the goal of managing all its email records in an electronic format by dec. 31, 2016. in the report, the state department said it had met the goal on its main, centralized email systems accounting for the “overwhelming majority” of its emails. “however, the department does have additional email systems that require further evaluation before we will certify that all email records are managed in an electronic format,” it said, saying it was working hard to “fully meet” the goal. the state department had no immediate comment on the matter. the department’s record keeping and email archiving practices attracted scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign when the new york times reported that clinton had used a private email server as secretary of state. the democrat’s use of the server to conduct official business throughout her 2009 2013 state department tenure was criticized by republican donald trump, who defeated her for the presidency in last november’s election. an internal government watchdog issued a report last year that found clinton broke government rules by using the private email server for her work as america’s top diplomat without approval. the state department’s office of the inspector general said it found no evidence clinton sought permission to use a server at her chappaqua, new york, home to handle her work emails and it quoted officials as saying they would have rejected her doing so if they had been asked. the report also found problems in department record keeping practices before clinton’s tenure, and it documented how slowly the department had moved to bring record keeping into the age of electronic communications.

" philippine president rodrigo duterte s honeymoon period may be over, but his deadly anti drugs campaign will not wane, his office said on monday, after a fall in ratings that his opponents said showed public disillusionment with his rule. duterte has enjoyed strong opinion poll numbers since winning the presidency in last year s elections but heavy scrutiny of his war on drugs, which has killed thousands of filipinos, appears to have impacted his ratings. trust and satisfaction in duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.  the honeymoon period of the president is usually for a year, so this is expected,  duterte s communications secretary, martin andanar, said in a radio interview, adding it should motivate the government to deliver on its overall objectives.  the social weather stations survey was conducted between september 23 27, two days after thousands of filipinos rallied to denounce duterte s drugs war and his authoritarian leadership style. the high death toll has stoked international alarm, although domestic polls have shown filipinos are largely supportive of his tough measures to fight crime and drugs. police say they have killed 3,900 drug suspects during their anti narcotics operations and deny executions have taken place, as human rights groups have alleged. but the campaign has been under the microscope of late, due largely to the high profile killing by police of a 17 year old student on aug. 16, which led to a senate probe. a murder investigation is under way.  police said he was a drug suspect killed because he opened fire on them while resisting arrest, but security camera footage showed him in police custody. his family insists he was executed. staunch critics of duterte were quick to take advantage of a survey slump they said reflected public discontent and scepticism about his drugs war.    it s very encouraging to know that the filipino people are beginning to see the light,  said senator antonio trillanes, a fierce opponent who has recently accused duterte of concealing assets when he was davao city mayor.   they are now seeing duterte for who he really is: a lying, rude, amoral, corrupt and oppressive former mayor who is totally incompetent about governance at the national level.  presidential spokesman ernesto abella also said the honeymoon was over, but duterte was not motivated by popularity ratings and was  bent on making sure that he addresses the three campaign themes which is crime, corruption and illegal drugs . duterte s office frequently cites polls, including sws, as a sign of his public support. peace and order are also one of the cornerstones of the 72 year old leader s economic agenda, which aims to lift the country s growth to 7 8 percent during his six year term.    senator risa hontiveros said the ratings dip showed duterte s  authoritarian style of governance is losing its appeal and support .  the writing on the wall is simple and clear: president duterte cannot govern based on fear, lies and killings,  hontiveros said in a statement.

" democratic presidential hopeful hillary clinton extended her lead over republican rival donald trump to 13 percentage points in a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on tuesday, up from 10 points at the end of last week. the july 8 12 poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supported clinton, the former secretary of state, while 33 percent supported trump, a celebrity real estate developer. another 21 percent did not support either candidate. that compared with 45 percent who supported clinton and 35 percent who supported trump in the five days to july 8.  clinton, the presumptive democratic nominee, has mostly led in the national online poll this year. the last time trump came close to clinton’s popularity was in early may, when his last two rivals for the republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign. trump, who is expected to become the official republican nominee at the party’s convention next week, has since lost ground in the poll as he struggled to refocus his campaign from the republican nominating contests to the nov. 8 general election.  over the past several weeks, trump has faced criticism for his past business dealings and has quarreled with republican leaders over his rejection of international trade agreements and his promises to crack down on immigration. clinton, meanwhile, has been dogged by criticisms of how she handled classified information as secretary of state.  james comey, director of the federal bureau of investigation, said last week that clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” with sensitive information but recommended that the government not seek criminal charges against her.  still, americans have become increasingly positive about clinton this month, with half of likely voters now saying they have a favorable view of her, according to the poll, up from 46 percent on july 1. some 60 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of trump, compared with 58 percent on july 1. the reuters/ipsos poll surveyed 1,146 likely voters across the continental united states, alaska and hawaii. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

" (this february 8 story has been refiled to correct word in name of bill to review from relief in second paragraph.) senior u.s. senators called on wednesday for the right to review any move the white house might make to ease sanctions on russia, amid mounting concern in congress   and among u.s. allies   that president donald trump will be too conciliatory toward moscow. the lawmakers, led by republican senator lindsey graham and democrat ben cardin, introduced “the russia sanctions review act of 2017,” modeled on a 2015 bill that let congress review the iran nuclear agreement signed by then president barack obama. trump’s open admiration for russian president vladimir putin and promises to rebuild frayed u.s. ties with moscow have raised questions over his commitment to maintaining sanctions against russia for its involvement in fighting in ukraine and annexation of crimea from ukraine. the bill announced on wednesday would require the administration to submit to congress a description of any proposed sanctions relief, as well as certification that moscow had stopped supporting actions to undermine the government of ukraine and ceased cyber attacks against the u.s. government and its people. the legislation would give the republican led senate and house of representatives 120 days to act, or decline to act, on any sanctions relief. during that period, trump would be barred from action to ease sanctions. after 120 days, sanctions relief would be granted only if the senate and house had not voted for a joint resolution of disapproval. the measure is also backed by republican senators marco rubio and john mccain and democrats sherrod brown and claire mccaskill. it was not immediately clear whether republican congressional leaders would back the measure or how it would fare in the house, but the bill has the support of some of the leading foreign policy voices in the senate. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters he did not want to specifically address the legislation. he pointed to support within the trump administration for keeping sanctions in place, noting that u.n. ambassador nikki haley had addressed the issue of keeping russian sanctions related to crimea “very forcefully.” a review of the bill by the senate foreign relations committee has not been scheduled, said a spokeswoman for senator bob corker, the committee’s chairman and author of the 2015 iran review act. cardin is the panel’s senior democrat. the spokeswoman added: “senator corker strongly supports keeping sanctions in place against russia for its continued destabilizing behavior in ukraine.”  ",0

[nw1n1n000y] attorney general jeff sessions said al imam was now in custody and the united states would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack. the appropriate congressional committees and the families of the americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said. the attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then secretary of state hillary clinton responded to the attack. earlier this month, u.s. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, ahmed abu khatallah. khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of u.s. military and fbi officials in libya and transported on a 13 day journey to the united states aboard a navy vessel. militants have exploited chaos following muammar gaddafi s 2011 downfall. islamic state took over sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the middle east and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.  islamic state militants has shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of tripoli as they seek to exploit libya s political divisions after their defeat in sirte. the united states has been carrying out strikes against the militant group in libya, striking more than a dozen militants in september.

" while u.s. president donald trump tried to win over skeptics in congress on tuesday, he never had to worry about losing the faithful at the quaker steak and lube. about two dozen fans of the 45th president gathered at the bar and restaurant in clearwater, florida, still committed to trump despite the tumult of his first 40 days in office. they praised the republican president’s first address to a joint session of congress, both for its familiar content and his newly deferential tone. “he nailed it. he knocked it out of the park,” said dean mears, 58, of clearwater, who watched with about two dozen others under large screen tvs that were tuned to fox news, the president’s favored cable news channel.  like trump supporters in other parts of the country, they praised the president’s more inclusive and less bombastic language as he also promised that “america must put its own citizens first,” crack down on illegal immigration and build up the military. the milder trump contrasted markedly with the candidate who insulted his rivals during the 2016 campaign, recently branded the news media the “enemy of the people” and was caught making vulgar remarks about grabbing women on a decade old video. in boone county, kentucky, the vice chairwoman of the local republican party, phyllis sparks, said she liked that trump “spoke not only to his base but to all americans.” kirt jacobs, a louisville entrepreneur, said trump “was all about we and very little, if any, about me.” in the denver suburbs, a voter who supported marco rubio in last year’s republican nominating contest, said trump validated her vote for him in november. “he had a much softer tone   more presidential   but stayed true to his principles,” said kathleen johnson. “he wasn’t blaming people and sounded more comforting.” a cnn/orc national poll found that 78 percent of respondents who watched the speech had a positive reaction. with 3 million tweets, trump’s speech was the most tweeted  about presidential address to congress, surpassing the previous record of 2.6 million for obama’s 2015 state of the union speech, a twitter spokesman said.  at the quaker steak and lube, the praise began beforehand, with a rally on the sidewalk outside where supporters waved signs reading: “america first” and “florida for trump.” they were mostly greeted by honking horns of approval, but also a few passing drivers who shouted expletives.  trump won 46 percent of the national popular vote in last year’s election, 2 percentage points behind democrat hillary clinton, but prevailed in the electoral college state by state tally needed to win the white house. nationally, his approval rating has sagged to a low level for a new president, around 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls by real clear politics. trump has been shaken by investigations into his campaign’s possible ties to russia, his misstatements about his levels of support, and a federal court’s halt to his executive order temporarily banning entry into the country for people from seven muslim majority nations. clearwater, on the gulf coast, sits in pinellas county in the heart of florida, where the past four statewide elections have been decided by about 1 percentage point. trump, a part time floridian, flipped the results from the last two presidential elections in pinellas county in his favor after former president barack obama, a democrat, carried the county in 2008 and 2012.  the county has long been a retirement destination, especially among those leaving the midwest. it is about 75 percent white, 11 percent black and 9 percent latino, according to 2015 census data.     speaking just before the address, ron sanders, 65, a baptist pastor living in nearby seminole, florida, wanted to hear trump tackle illegal immigration, which the president did. he also hoped trump’s speech would help to bring in line moderate republican senators who have been critical of some of his early efforts, which is not yet certain. “he’s sticking to what he said. it’s not discouraging trump at all,” said sanders, wearing a cowboy hat colored like an american flag. “he’s going full guns ahead.” ",0
" lebanon s army chief told his soldiers on tuesday to be extra vigilant to prevent unrest during political turmoil after the prime minister quit, and accused israel of  aggressive  intentions at the southern frontier. troops should be ready to  thwart any attempt to exploit the current circumstances for stirring strife,  the army s twitter account quoted general joseph aoun as saying ahead of independence day celebrations on wednesday.  the exceptional political situation that lebanon is going through requires you to exercise the highest levels of awareness.  aoun called on troops to  assume full readiness at the southern border to face the threats of the israeli enemy, its violations, and the aggressive intentions it is indicating towards lebanon.  a senior israeli official dismissed the warnings of border aggression as  nonsense . lebanon was thrust back onto the forefront of regional rivalry between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran, after its prime minister quit this month in a broadcast from riyadh.      in his shock resignation, saad al hariri railed against the iran backed shi ite military and political movement hezbollah,  which both saudi arabia and israel consider an enemy. the lebanese president has refused to accept hariri s resignation until he returns to lebanon.  the saudis have demanded that hezbollah stop meddling in regional conflicts and say it must disarm. hezbollah has long said it must keep its arsenal to protect lebanon from israel, and its leader sayyed hassan nasrallah accused the saudis this month of inciting israel to attack lebanon. he said he could not rule out a new clash with israel, although he described it as unlikely. in a televised speech on monday, nasrallah suggested the saudis and israelis were working together.  tensions grew earlier this year between israel and hezbollah, which fought a month long war in 2006 that killed around 1,200 people in lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 israelis, most of them troops.  israeli energy minister yuval steinmetz said this week that israel has had covert contacts with riyadh amid common concerns over iran, a rare disclosure by a senior official from either country of long rumored secret dealings. but israel dismissed claims that it is planning military action against hezbollah at the behest of saudi arabia.  we are not interested in an escalation with lebanon,  israeli education minister naftali bennett, a member of the security cabinet, told reuters about the accusation of israeli saudi collusion.  however, bennett added:  if rockets are fired from lebanon at israeli cities, then we will see that as a declaration of war by the state of lebanon and will act with all our might.  in israel, where the 2006 war was widely seen as inconclusive, there is little in the public mood or political discourse to suggest fighting with hezbollah is imminent. but israeli officials have voiced deep concern about iran and hezbollah s expanding influence in the region.  the saudis and israel definitely have common interests today,  including the threat from iran, israeli justice minister ayelet shaked said in a radio interview last week.  the countries  coming together could serve both of them.   but, shaked said,  we don t work for anyone. we first and foremost look out for our interests.

" a group of allies of ivory coast s former president laurent gbagbo, including at least one living in exile in neighboring ghana, are behind a wave of attacks on security installations this year, the interior minister said on thursday. thirty five people, a number of them soldiers, have been arrested for involvement in the violence, according to a statement released by sidiki diakite following a meeting of the national security council. francophone west africa s biggest economy has been shaken by army mutinies, violent protests by former rebels and a spate of attacks on prisons and police stations this year.  the attacks have raised fears over its long term stability, more than six years after a prolonged crisis ended in a civil war that killed more than 3,000, when gbagbo refused to cede a 2010 election to current president alassane ouattara.   most of the people were already implicated in similar attacks around 2012 to 2014,  diakite said.  arrested and imprisoned, they were freed in the spirit of political dialogue and reconciliation.   previously, much of this year s violence has been blamed on disgruntled former members of the rebel group that helped ouattara dislodge gbagbo, but former fighters loyal to gbagbo have been blamed for attacks in the past, including several that killed 10 soldiers in the commercial capital abidjan in 2012 and other deadly attacks near the liberian border in 2014. gbagbo was captured in april 2011 and is on trial at the international criminal court on war crimes charges, but many of his allies have been pardoned.  it is clear that the clemency offered them with a view to peace and reconciliation was not understood by them, and so they continue to pose a threat,  the minister said. ghanaian government officials were not immediately available to comment on the allegations. ivory coast has accused accra in the past of not doing enough to track down gbagbo supporters. ouattara has won praise for helping ivory coast recover from a decade of crisis to become africa s fastest growing economy, but thousands of weapons left over from the war are still in circulation and the army is crippled by internal divisions. if gbagbo s allies are behind recent attacks, ivory coast faces the prospect of instability from both them and the rebels they fought as it approaches what is likely to be a hotly contested election to choose ouattara s successor in 2020.

" federal and state authorities are beefing up cyber defenses against potential electronic attacks on voting systems ahead of u.s. elections on nov. 8, but few are taking new steps to guard against possible civil unrest or violence. the threat of computer hacking and the potential for violent clashes is darkening an already rancorous presidential race between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump, amid fears that russia or other actors could spread political misinformation online or perhaps tamper with voting. to counter the cyber threat, all but two u.s. states have accepted help from the u.s. department of homeland security (dhs) to probe and scan voter registration and election systems for vulnerabilities, a department official told reuters. ohio has asked a cyber protection unit of the national guard, a reserve force within the u.s. military, for assistance to protect the state’s systems. on thursday, arizona secretary of state michele reagan and her cyber security team met with officials from the fbi and the dhs, in addition to state level agencies, to discuss cyber threats, said matt roberts, a spokesman for reagan. the national governors association on friday said election officials were well prepared for possible cyber threats and had been confronting them for over a decade. “we remain confident that any technical problems on election night will not undermine the overall integrity of the process,” the association said in a statement. unidentified intelligence officials told nbc news on thursday there is no specific warning about an election day attack, but they remain concerned hackers from russia or elsewhere may try to disrupt the process, likely by spreading misinformation through social media sites. the potential for violence around the election has loomed in the background of the campaign for months. armed groups around the country have pledged in unprecedented numbers to monitor voting sites for signs of election fraud. federal officials have warned authorities in new york, texas and virginia about an unspecific threat of attacks by the al qaeda militant group around election day, putting local law enforcement on alert before tuesday’s vote. a u.s. government source in washington said some federal agencies sent bulletins to local and state officials flagging the information but that the threat was relatively low level. “we are continuing with the high level of patrols at all of our facilities that we have had in place for some time now,” said spokesman steve coleman of the port authority, which operates airports, tunnels and bridges around the area. voter intimidation reported at polling sites so far prompted democrats to accuse trump of a “campaign of vigilante voter intimidation” in four states on monday. but local authorities surveyed by reuters on thursday in five states   ohio, pennsylvania, arizona, wisconsin and florida   said they were not increasing election related law enforcement personnel or resources above 2012 levels. the fbi, which designates one special agent from each of its 56 field offices for election crime matters, has not increased its numbers or given staff additional training this year, said an fbi spokeswoman. there has been no “substantive change” in the number of personnel deployed by the rest of the justice department, which designates assistant u.s. attorneys and federal prosecutors within the agency’s public integrity section to handle election crimes, according to a spokesman. jim pasco, executive director of the fraternal order of police, which represents hundreds of thousands of u.s. officers, said cops are taking the same security measures they would take for any large event. he said he expects the vows by militias to monitor the polls to be “a lot of talk, little action.” ",0
" president donald trump on wednesday called the russia sanctions legislation he signed into law “significantly flawed” and urged congress to not use the measure to hinder u.s. efforts to resolve the ukraine conflict with its european allies. “while i favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by iran, north korea, and russia, this legislation is significantly flawed,” the republican president said in a statement. “in its haste to pass this legislation, the congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.”   ",0

" former u.s. vice president al gore, a leading voice in the fight against climate change, and donald trump, who at one point called it a hoax, met on monday in what gore called a “productive” session. gore, a democrat, spent about 90 minutes in meetings at the republican president elect’s trump tower apartment and office building in manhattan. he also met briefly with trump’s daughter ivanka, who has attended a series of high level meetings since her father won the nov. 8 election. gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to republican george w. bush, has been devoted for years to lowering carbon emissions blamed for climate change. as he campaigned for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton earlier this year, gore, who was vice president under clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, warned that trump would steer the world toward “climate catastrophe” if elected. that warning came as trump gave speeches calling on the united states to drop out of last year’s global climate accord, signed in paris to lower carbon emissions blamed for a warming planet.  trump also referred to human induced climate change as a hoax and had tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non competitive.” since then, however, in an interview with the new york times, trump has indicated he might have an open mind to joining the effort to battle climate change. gore had a more upbeat take on trump after huddling with the wealthy new york real estate developer. “it was a sincere search for areas of common ground,” gore said. “i found it an extremely interesting conversation and, to be continued.” gore said on msnbc later on monday that ivanka trump was “very committed to having a climate policy that makes sense.” he said he would not disclose details out of respect for the privacy of the conversations and out of hopes to keep discussing the issue with the president elect. aides to trump gave no further insight into monday’s meeting. vice president elect mike pence, asked about the meeting as he left trump tower, declined to comment. he said monday was “another productive day on the transition.” after a day of meetings, trump left his home on monday evening to have dinner with his family at 21 club, a new york restaurant. gore, who shared the nobel peace prize in 2007 for his work urging action against the risks of global warming, was kicking off on monday a 24 hour talk a thon to urge action in the battle against climate change, which threatens to raise sea levels, spread diseases and increase droughts in more regions around the world. trump was scheduled to meet on tuesday with rex tillerson, the chief executive of exxon mobil corp, who is being considered for the job of secretary of state. trump takes office on jan. 20. exxon mobil has embraced the 2015 paris agreement that would lower global greenhouse gas emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. an aide to gore said trump’s team reached out to him after the former vice president said he intended to do everything he could to work with the president elect to ensure the united states remained a leader in the effort to address climate change.

" a small christmas market has opened in algeria s capital, catering to a rising number of christian african migrants as well as diplomats and locals in the overwhelmingly muslim country. around 99 percent of algeria s population is sunni muslim but the number of christians has been rising due to an influx of  migrants from sub saharan countries such as mali, niger and burkina faso. the market, organized by the caritas charity, is also a sign of stable security in a country that has rebounded from a decade of islamist militant violence during which 200,000 people died. diplomats used to hunker down in fortified embassies, rarely venturing out, but now live alongside algerians in residential quarters. no militant attack has been reported in algiers for more than 10 years. caritas staged a similar christmas market last year but kept it low profile. this year it advertised the market in advance, calling for a  living together  between christians and muslims. no official figure is available for the number of african migrants, but some estimates put it at around 100,000.  it is not about making money, but rather about using the money to help the most vulnerable, whether algerians, african migrants or syrians,  caritas algeria director maurice pilloud said. veiled muslim women mix with foreigners at the market in algiers  el biar district, where honey, chocolate, cakes, jewelry and trinkets are sold. many donations came from muslims, said pilloud. the market offers the chance for young people to make a contribution to society in a political system where the ruling  party has dominated all aspects of the oil producing north african state since independence in 1962.  charitable work remains most attractive for a majority of young algerians who shun political action because it doesn t bring change,  said cherif lounes, 47, who was visiting the market along with his mother.  we need 50 caritas associations in algeria to help the vulnerable, whether algerians or migrants,  added saida, his 79 year old mother.

" chastened by their worst result since 1949 in september s national election, chancellor angela merkel s conservatives are hoping for victory in a regional vote on sunday to strengthen their hand in thorny three way coalition talks in berlin. while victory in the lower saxony region might strengthen merkel s position within her party, a conservative failure to emerge as the strongest party could prompt talk of weakening authority and possible eventual succession, said berlin based political expert gero neugebauer. lower saxony, an agricultural heartland and germany s second biggest region, offers merkel s christian democrats (cdu) the prospect of a morale boost as they seek to cobble together an unprecedented  jamaica  national coalition with the liberal free democrats (fdp) and greens. the road to such an alliance, named after the caribbean nation as the parties  colors match those of its flag, is littered with disputes on everything from migrants to tax and the environment. it would be the clunky coalition s federal debut if talks, due to start next week, prove a success. carsten nickel, deputy research director at teneo intelligence, said sunday s election   which polls show is set to be a neck and neck contest between the cdu and the rival social democrats (spd)   would determine momentum going into national coalition negotiations. the election in the northern state, home to carmaker volkswagen (vowg_p.de), was called after a lawmaker in the greens party   junior coalition partner to the spd there   defected to the cdu, robbing the ruling alliance of its one seat majority.  if merkel managed to steal that state from the spd, it would probably be a little bit of a boost,  he said.  it would probably be slightly easier for her to argue internally for the required compromise and for striking the deals and so on that will be required over the next couple of weeks.   however, a new poll for broadcaster zdp released late on thursday showed the spd with 34.5 percent, closely followed by the cdu with 33 percent. the greens and fdp both had 9 percent while the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) was on track to get 7 percent and move into lower saxony s state assembly for the first time. the left party got 5 percent. about 29 percent of voters were still undecided about which party to support or whether to vote at all, it showed. the cdu has dropped far below the 12 point lead it had over the spd in august at the start of a campaign that has centered on regional issues such as education, as well as an influx of migrants to germany over the last two years. the latest poll means the spd and greens would not have enough support to govern again, even if they joined forces with the left party. that leaves a coalition of the spd and conservatives, a coalition of the spd, greens and fdp, or the jamaica coalition being pursued on a national level. merkel s cdu and their bavarian sister party (csu) removed a major stumbling block to those coalition talks on sunday by ending a dispute over migrant policy with an agreement to limit the number of migrants coming to germany. merkel s conservative bloc won 33 percent in september s national election, losing 8.5 points compared with 2013, as voters upset with merkel s 2015 decision to open the borders to more than a million migrants abandoned the party. the result effectively brought an end to the existing national coalition with the spd, who also performed badly.

" an attack that killed more than 300 people in north sinai has prompted egyptian officials to renew efforts to enlist local tribes whose support will be critical in attempts to defeat islamic state, security and military sources said.  brandishing an islamic state flag, masked men in military style uniforms fired on worshippers at a village mosque on friday in the worst such bloodshed in modern egyptian history. it was a dramatic setback for the military, which has been fighting militant groups in the sinai peninsula for years with air strikes, ground assaults and mass arrests, while hundreds of police and soldiers have been killed. lacking sufficient counter insurgency skills, the army began recruiting tribesmen three years ago, hoping their mastery of the sinai s inhospitable terrain would provide intelligence on the militants and their arms smuggling routes. that campaign has produced limited results and the latest bloodshed will pressure the army to secure better cooperation from tribal leaders despite some gains against islamic state this year.      no group has claimed responsibility for friday s assault, whose brutality shocked egyptians. on wednesday, president abdel fattah al sisi ordered the  military to secure the sinai within the next three months.  you can use all brute force necessary,  he said. tribes in the sinai vowed to unite and join forces with the army after fellow bedouins were killed in friday s carnage. but such declarations by sinai tribes   which accuse the cairo government of treating them like second class citizens   have in the past produced limited results. in addition, tribesmen remain divided over feuds and other local issues.  the egyptian military has more than enough weapons. the biggest issue when it comes to doing anything in the sinai is to make sure they have good intelligence,  said ha hellyer, an egypt expert and senior non resident fellow at the atlantic council.  if it is going to be a counter terrorism, counter insurgency set of strategies, that will necessitate involvement from the tribes at a very significant level.  three security and military sources said that over the past two days talks had been held between security officials and tribal leaders in north and central sinai. those security officials said greater coordination and cooperation were needed to defeat the militants. the tribes were divided into five groups and security officials sat separately with each group.   we asked them to help us to control the militants in the areas that they live, farm and move in, because each tribe knows its own people best,  said one of the sources.  there are many things that make them cooperate with us and they vary from each tribe to the next. that s why we sat separately with each tribe. one tribe needs services, and there is economic cooperation on projects with another tribe.  a spokesman for the military said it had made no statement on tribal affairs in sinai and he could not comment alliances with tribes have succeeded in other countries facing serious extremist threats   under the right conditions.  in 2006, sunni tribesmen joined forces with u.s. troops in iraq and rebelled against al qaeda in what became known as the  sahwa , or awakening.  by january 2009, washington had invested more than $400 million in the awakening program, according to u.s. data. fighters were paid as much as $300 400 a month.  that investment paid off, helping iraqi security forces to defeat al qaeda then.  under a sisi initiative in 2015 to reinforce cooperation, several hundred bedouins were to be recruited. occasionally, they joined patrols and manned checkpoints under supervision. but some tribal leaders were reluctant to team up with the army without more weapons to confront battle hardened militant fighters. authorities are wary of supplying arms to tribes with a history of animosity to cairo, security officials say.  when the security officials spoke to the tribal leaders, they told them that there is no third option in front of them. either with us or against us,  another source said.   most of the tribes immediately announced their cooperation with security forces, and others asked for some time to think. but i think that the security forces don t have the time to give them to think.  mustafa al aqili, of the supreme council of arab tribes, said heavy losses in the mosque attack could encourage both sides to work more closely together. but he stressed waging war against radicals was the responsibility of the military.   sinai s people grew stronger after that attack and they are standing more with the army,  he said.  they are keen to join the fighting. but that is the job of the army.  a security source in el arish, the main city in north sinai, said ties have improved.   the bedouins are cooperating with us and have increased their cooperation,  he said. bringing sinai s tribes together and on the military s side will not be easy. the cash strapped government would have to create jobs and invest in schools and infrastructure. to appease angry residents for now, authorities announced $10 million in funds shortly after the attack.  we have no relationship with politics or anything else, and don t cooperate with the army or armed groups,  said mansur eid, who lost his son in friday s attack.  we just live in poverty here.  egypt may face a bigger challenge if islamic state militants defeated in iraq, syria and libya join comrades in the sinai. help from tribes would be even more important. friday s attack was similar to islamic state s approach in iraq, where it has bombed places of worship in a bid to deepen sectarian strife. sisi has said that fighters returning from iraq and syria may seek refuge in libya and target egypt from there.   in his most recent speech released in september, islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi urged followers in north sinai to keep fighting after the group was defeated in mosul.  tribal leaders say there are around 800 militants, mostly egyptians, with some palestinians and other foreigners, in the north sinai. but even small numbers of fighters have inflicted heavy casualties with suicide bombings in egypt and elsewhere. islamic state is also seeking to enlist tribesmen in the sinai, and ahmed zagloul, a researcher on islamist movements, said it had managed to recruit from the largest tribes. by capitalizing on frustrations with the government and civilian deaths, islamic state has won some support despite its brutal methods. many in the sinai were not won over by the government s methods of fighting terrorism, which had left some villages completely destroyed, said sheikh ibrahim al menei, a leader of the sawarka tribe.

" turkey summoned the german ambassador to ankara on saturday over what it said was a kurdish militant rally in cologne, the foreign ministry said, in a further sign of strained relations between the nato allies.  we condemn the organization of a rally in the german city of cologne by the extensions of the pkk terrorist organizations, and the allowing of terror propaganda. we have voiced our reaction in a strong manner to germany s ambassador to ankara, who was called to the ministry,  it said. state run anadolu news agency said some 3,000 kurdish supporters demonstrated in cologne on saturday carrying posters calling for the release of abdullah ocalan, the jailed leader of the kurdistan workers party (pkk), which is listed as a terrorist group by the european union and the united states, and is banned in germany. turkey has accused germany of not doing enough to stop pkk activities.  the double standard approach germany has been following with regards to the global fight against terrorism is worrying. we call on germany to show a principled stance against all kinds of terror,  the ministry said. relations with europe, particularly germany, have been strained since president tayyip erdogan launched a crackdown after a failed coup last year. more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 people, including journalists and opposition figures, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. germany has criticized the mass arrests, refused to extradite people turkey says were involved in the putsch attempt and demanded the release of around a dozen german citizens arrested in recent months.

" former fbi director james comey’s testimony that u.s. president donald trump expected loyalty and hoped comey would drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against trump, several legal experts said.  such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the u.s. house of representatives, which is controlled by trump’s fellow republicans. according to written testimony posted on the senate intelligence committee’s website on wednesday, comey said trump told him during a one on one feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser michael flynn was a “good guy” and hoped that comey could see his “way clear” to letting go a probe into ties between flynn and russia. trump had fired flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the russian ambassador to the united states.  comey’s account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on thursday, could show that trump intended to impede the flynn investigation, said michael gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the university of north carolina school of law.  “the express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting,” and could heighten speculation that the “president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the russia investigation,” gerhardt said. comey, who was fired by trump on may 9, was leading an fbi investigation of flynn as it looks into allegations of links between russia and trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. moscow and trump have both denied any collusion. trump’s lawyer, marc kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a reuters query about whether comey’s testimony would support an obstruction case. but he said in a statement that trump felt “vindicated” by comey’s confirmation he was not under investigation in any russia probe.     to build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with “corrupt” intent. it does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation.  while a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment.  bruce green, a professor at fordham university school of law, said it would be difficult to show trump intended to impede the flynn investigation. he said trump could say he was merely vouching for flynn’s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president. alan dershowitz, a professor emeritus at harvard law school and well known defense lawyer, added that trump’s comments to comey were “ambiguous statements” and “not even close to obstruction of justice.”  other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the feb. 14 conversation could indicate that trump intended to interfere with the flynn probe.   according to comey, trump told his close advisers, including attorney general jeff sessions and jared kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to comey privately. “asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” said andrew wright, a professor of constitutional law at savannah law school. wright said there were other damaging details in comey’s testimony, including that comey did not document his conversations with former president barack obama but “felt compelled” to do so after his first conversation with trump. comey’s testimony does “maximum damage” to trump, wright said. gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to trump, saying: “some people who weren’t concerned before should be concerned now.”  ",0
" the tax oversight committee in the u.s. house of representatives will hold public hearings in coming weeks as the panel prepares to unveil legislation to overhaul the u.s. tax code, congressional aides said on wednesday. the plan for hearings emerged during an hour long meeting between house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady and 15 panel democrats, according to a house democratic aide.  there were no details about when the hearings would occur, what tax reform issues would be addressed or whether the full ways and means committee would preside.  “we had a positive and open discussion, and i appreciated the opportunity to engage in a two way dialogue,” brady, a texas republican, said in a statement afterward.  the republican led committee is expected to unveil tax reform legislation this spring in preparation for a summer vote on the house floor. committee staff have been working to craft a bill based on a house republican blueprint that would sharply cut taxes for businesses and individuals. house speaker paul ryan said on wednesday that the house, senate and white house, all controlled by republicans, “aren’t on the same page yet on tax reform.” brady announced the bipartisan meeting earlier this week, saying the discussion would focus on ways to simplify the u.s. tax code for individuals and prevent u.s. companies from moving production and research facilities overseas   two republican objectives.  “it was clear from this meeting we share the same fundamental goals on tax reform, particularly as it relates to growth and simplicity,” a republican committee aide said. brady underscored his intention to include a border adjustment tax provision in tax reform legislation, aides said. the policy, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, has divided the business community and drawn criticism from republicans in the house and senate.  wednesday’s meeting marked the first time brady sat down with the committee’s democratic members to discuss the house republican tax reform plan, aides said. but the bipartisan atmosphere was jarred by the release of a letter from committee republicans to president donald trump, calling for the removal of john koskinen as internal revenue service commissioner. koskinen was appointed by former democratic president barack obama. “democrats raised this letter with republicans during the meeting, noting how this type of partisan action hurts the prospects for bipartisanship in other issues, such as working together on issues like tax reform,” the democratic aide said.

" president donald trump has made his selection for the next full time head of the office of the comptroller of the currency, according to u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin. testifying before lawmakers on thursday, mnuchin did not name the person tapped for the job, but said the decision had been made and the individual is going through background checks before a formal announcement. the comptroller position is currently being filled in an acting capacity by keith noreika, an attorney whom mnuchin named as interim head earlier in may. noreika replaced thomas curry, who had served as comptroller under president obama. “we actually have someone the president has approved that is going through the fbi vetting process,” mnuchin said. “this is a time consuming process.”  joseph otting, who formerly worked as a banking executive at  onewest bank, which mnuchin once headed, is believed to be the favorite for the position.        mnuchin said that an occ pick had been made in response to criticism from democrats, who objected to trump installing a new bank regulator on an interim basis who was not confirmed by the senate. senator chris van hollen of maryland questioned whether this approach was to skirt senate approval. but mnuchin insisted noreika was put in place simply to get someone in the post while a permanent nominee was selected. the comptroller’s office writes money laundering rules, bank charters and closely monitors banks’ lending activities.

"last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. this report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.according to police spokesman stefan dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during borl nge s  peace and love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.it appears that nothing has changed since last year. yesterday, swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on friday evening.a 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the br valla festival in norrk ping on friday night.according to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  it s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, thomas agnevik, to aftonbladet.we have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.the girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.during the city festival in v ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  we have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in v stmanland, thomas gustafsson.a 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  she has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. therefore, i do not have any more details, says gustafsson.rapes at swedish festivals are not really news anymore. it is merely about announcements. we are actually there now.  speisa",1
" a u.s. senator on tuesday asked the defense department to explain how it manages the risks when it uses software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments, saying the practice may represent a national security threat. reuters reported earlier this month that hewlett packard enterprise co allowed a russian defense agency to review the source code or inner workings of cyber defense software known as arcsight, which is used by the pentagon to guard its computer networks. “hpe’s arcsight system constitutes a significant element of the u.s. military’s cyber defenses,” democratic senator jeanne shaheen wrote in a letter to defense secretary james mattis seen by reuters.  shaheen, a member of the senate armed services committee, said disclosure of arcsight’s source code to the russian agency presented an “opportunity to exploit a system used on [defense department] platforms.” shaheen questioned whether the trump administration was pushing back on demands for source code from russia and elsewhere that are imposed on u.s. companies as a condition for entry into foreign markets.  such reviews highlight a quandary for u.s. technology companies, as they weigh u.s. cyber security protections while pursuing business with some of washington’s adversaries, including russia and china, according to security experts. “i understand that individual businesses must make decisions weighing the risk of intellectual property disclosure against the opportunity of accessing significant overseas markets,” shaheen wrote. “however, when such products undergird [defense department] cyber defenses, our national security may be at stake in these decisions.” the pentagon and hpe did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the letter. cyber security experts, former u.s. intelligence officials and former arcsight employees said the review of arcsight’s core instruction, also known as source code, could help moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping hackers to blind the u.s. military to an attack.  hpe has said in the past that such reviews, by a russian government accredited testing company, have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of russia. the software maker has also said it closely supervises the process and that no code is allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it does not compromise the safety of its products. a company spokeswoman said last week that no current hpe products have undergone russian source code reviews. hpe was spun off from hewlett packard inc as a separate software company in 2015.  shaheen’s letter asked mattis whether he foresaw risks associated with the disclosure of arcsight’s code and whether the pentagon was monitoring whether technology vendors share source code or “other sensitive technical data.”  she also asked how frequently vendors disclose the source code of products used by the pentagon to foreign governments. shaheen recently led successful efforts in congress to ban all government use of software provided by moscow based antivirus firm kaspersky lab, amid allegations the company is allied with russian intelligence. kaspersky vehemently denies such links. tech companies have been under increasing pressure to allow the russian government to examine source code in exchange for approvals to sell products in russia. while many western firms have complied, some, including california based cyber firm symantec, have refused. arcsight was sold to british tech company micro focus international plc in a deal completed in september. the company said last week that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

" president donald trump is set to sign an order to greatly reduce the role climate change plays in decision making across the u.s. government, bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the administration’s plan. the order, which could be signed this week, aims to reverse former democratic president barack obama's broad approach for addressing climate change, the report said. (bloom.bg/2nkdvko) the directive will urge the u.s. environmental protection agency to undo the clean power plan, the bloomberg report said. the clean power plan is obama’s centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several republican states. according to the report, the measure would direct u.s. regulators to rescind obama era regulations limiting oil industry emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. the order will also involve a reconsideration of the government’s use of a metric known as the “social cost of carbon”, which weighs the potential economic damage from climate change, bloomberg reported on tuesday. trump has long signaled his intention to reverse obama’s climate change initiatives, but the republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize america’s water and air quality. reuters reported earlier this month that the white house had proposed to slash a quarter of the epa’s budget, targeting climate change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination. the bloomberg report said that some of the changes could happen immediately, while others could take years to implement.

" the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee, said on tuesday that the committee can conduct a credible investigation of russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 u.s. election, despite president donald trump’s firing of fbi director james comey. “i think (intelligence committee) chairman (richard) burr is still absolutely committed to having this investigation follow the facts,” u.s. senator mark warner told reuters. he also said he was open to the idea of a special prosecutor or special counsel, adding that it would not interfere with congressional investigations. but warner he did not think a special committee would work if it included commissioners appointed by the trump administration, questioning whether the administration could be impartial.

" the trump administration has named career diplomat philip goldberg to head the all but abandoned u.s. embassy in havana, according to three sources familiar with the matter, at a time of heightened tensions between the united states and cuba. goldberg has lengthy experience in a number of countries, and was described by a u.s. congressional aide on monday as  career and the best of the best . but his appointment may ruffle feathers in havana. he was expelled from cuba s socialist ally bolivia in 2008 for what president evo morales claimed was fomenting social unrest. the appointment has not been publicly announced. if approved by cuba, goldberg will arrive at a low moment in bilateral relations. the embassy was reopened in 2015 for the first time since 1961, as part of a fragile detente by former democratic u.s. president barack obama. but the administration of republican president donald trump has returned to cold war characterizations of the cuban government and imposed new restrictions on doing business in cuba and travel. it has charged cuba with responsibility for health problems affecting some two dozen diplomats or their family members, which it has termed attacks. cuba denies the charges.  the u.s. embassy has been reduced to a skeleton staff and has suspended almost all visa processing after the trump administration in october pulled 60 percent of embassy personnel and ordered a similar reduction at the cuban embassy in washington, expelling 15 diplomats. the position is not an ambassador role and does not need to be approved by the u.s. congress. there has been no ambassador since the embassy re opened, after the republican controlled senate opposed obama s pick. instead, goldberg will take over from jeffrey delaurentis, who left in july, as charge d affaires. goldberg s other previous posts include the chief of mission in kosovo. most recently he has been the u.s. ambassador to the philippines.  appointing ambassador goldberg to head the u.s. embassy in cuba is rather provocative since he was expelled from bolivia,   american university professor of government william leogrande, a cuba expert, said.  but ambassador goldberg is a foreign service professional and will ably represent the policies of trump s administration. time will tell if he has been instructed to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor ... or carry out a more hostile policy,  he said. the embassy was closed in 1961 when the united states broke diplomatic relations. the countries maintained lower level interests sections in each other s capitals from 1977 to 2015, under the auspices of switzerland.

" german chancellor angela merkel and chinese president xi jinping agreed in a telephone call on thursday about the need to tighten sanctions against north korea in light of pyongyang s latest nuclear weapons test, a spokesman for merkel said. both leaders expressed deep concern about the current situation in north korea, and viewed the latest north korean nuclear weapons test as a significant danger for the security of the entire region, as well as a violation of international law, steffen seibert said in a statement.  both leaders said they supported a tightening of the sanctions against north korea,  he said.  at the same time, however, it was important to continue seeking dialogue to peacefully resolve the current tensions, he added.

" u.s. asia experts who served in past republican administrations said on monday they would back hillary clinton in the presidential race as a donald trump presidency would lead to “ruinous marginalization” for the united states in the region. in an open letter, the eight former senior officials said that with global strategic competition growing, including from china, it was “absolutely the wrong time to elect an unstable, ill prepared amateur with no vision or foresight to meet the manifold challenges of the 21st century.” they said the republican nominee offered “only bluster or preposterous panaceas” for asia that would “wreck our country’s credibility, economy, and leadership in very short order.” the signatories to the letter included michael green, who served as president george w. bush’s top asia adviser at the white house, james clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, and patrick cronin, a former senior official at the u.s. agency for international development. should trump get the chance to put his “nostrums” into practice, asian countries would be forced to shift towards states challenging the united states, most notably china, and some might seek security through nuclear weapons, the former officials said. “in short, if the trump brand ... becomes america’s brand, we can expect ruinous marginalization in asia and unwanted compliance with rules which the chinese and other challengers set,” they said. their letter was the latest repudiation of trump’s candidacy by republican national security specialists. last week, 50 former republican national security officials, including a former cia director, called trump unqualified to lead and said he would be “the most reckless president in american history.” trump responded to that statement by deriding the signatories as members of “the failed washington elite” who “deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.” trump has caused alarm in asia and beyond by saying he would consider letting japan and south korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than have them relying on the united states for protection against north korea and china. while making u.s. allies anxious, trump has also irritated beijing with his comments, such as by comparing the u.s. trade deficit with china to rape. one chinese state newspaper equated him to hitler. at the same time, beijing also sees trump as a businessmen with whom it could probably negotiate and may also hope he would be less tough on human rights than clinton.

" two years ago there were questions over whether indian prime minister narendra modi could get a visa to enter the united states. next week he visits washington as one of president barack obama’s closest international partners. obama invited modi for one of the last big visits by a world leader before his term ends in january. although the trip won’t feature a lavish state dinner, the indian leader will address both houses of congress, considered a rare honor. this will be their seventh meeting since modi became prime minister in may 2014, an impressive tally for a u.s. president and a leader who is not a formal ally, said ashley tellis at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington. “the personal relationship between the president and the prime minister ... is really one of the unanticipated surprises of the past two years,” said tellis, an expert on india. the developing relationship is seen as an obama foreign policy success. washington views india as an important part of its rebalance to asia and as a counterweight to china.     the two countries are finalizing agreements that would make it possible for their militaries to cooperate more closely, and for u.s. defense manufacturers to both sell and make high tech weaponry in india. a deal on logistics would govern issues such as how the two countries account for costs of military exercises. another involves encrypted communications and geospatial data transfer. a history of colonial rule followed by decades of non alignment has, however, made new delhi wary of an embrace by the more powerful united states, which has overtaken russia as india’s top arms supplier. “it is neither a strategic partnership nor an alliance,” said nitin gokhale, founder of defense portal bharat shakti. “it can be a long term arrangement, but to call it a strategic partnership would be premature.”     there are frustrations, too, on the u.s. side. the two countries reached a civil nuclear agreement in 2005, but it has yet to yield any contracts for u.s. based companies. only now is westinghouse, a unit of japan’s toshiba, approaching the finish line on a deal to build six reactors in india. the visit gives modi a chance to network with u.s. lawmakers who may feature in a donald trump or hillary clinton administration but, as it coincides with the california primary, he is not expected to meet either. modi is generally popular with u.s. lawmakers, who extended his invitation to address congress. but they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to u.s. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, and question new delhi’s record on human rights. “the economic engagement between our two countries should increase and it should be more accessible for u.s. companies,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said in a telephone interview.  obama and modi are expected to discuss india’s desire to join the nuclear suppliers group (nsg), a 48 member club of nuclear trading nations. india was shut out for decades because of its weapons program, and the civil nuclear agreement with the united states gave it access to foreign suppliers without giving up its arms. obama administration officials have said they backed india’s desire to join the group, but the idea faces resistance among some on capitol hill, as well as from china, an ally of india’s arch rival pakistan. “existing nsg guidelines were established to guard against nuclear proliferation, and we should not create exceptions for particular countries,” corker said. there is lingering concern in washington over modi’s handling of communal riots in 2002 that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly muslims, in gujarat. modi was chief minister of the state at the time and, though a court ordered inquiry found insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the issue prevented him from getting a u.s. visa for years. ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, raised human rights on a visit to new delhi this week, saying the two largest democracies had “special obligations” to set the highest standards. congress’ tom lantos human rights commission has scheduled a hearing on india for june 7, the day modi arrives in washington and the day before his address to the combined house of representatives and senate. he leaves the united states on june 8. corker promised to asked modi about india’s record on human trafficking, which he brought up recently in an emotional senate hearing with obama administration officials. “the country we believe has 12 14 million slaves, which is close to half the number we believe exists worldwide,” corker said. “it’s obviously a very significant issue and when he’s here, it’s one i certainly plan to raise.” ",0
" french president emmanuel macron said on wednesday he did not support u.s. president donald trump s  unilateral  decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and called for calm across the region.  this decision is a regrettable decision that france does not approve of and goes against international law and all the resolutions of the u.n. security council,  macron told reporters at a news conference in algiers. trump reversed decades of u.s. policy on wednesday and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and said he would move the embassy to the city, despite warnings from around the world that the gesture further drives a wedge between israel and the palestinians.  the status of jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. the status of jerusalem must be determined by israelis and palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the united nations,  he said.  macron, who has developed a good working relationship with trump since taking office in may, spoke to the u.s. leader earlier this week to try to convince him to change his mind.  france and europe are attached to a two state solution   israel and palestine   leaving side by side in peace and security within recognized international borders with jerusalem the capital of both states,  he said, adding that paris was ready to work with partners to find a solution.  he called for calm.  for now, i urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible. we must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue,  he said.

" south korean police have arrested the owner and the manager of a building where 29 people died in a fire last week, accusing the pair of multiple safety lapses, including blocked exits and malfunctioning sprinkler systems. on thursday, a fire ripped through an eight story high rise in the small city of jecheon. at least 20 of the victims were women who were overcome by toxic fumes in a second floor sauna. jecheon police have only identified the owner by his last name of lee, and the manager by his last name of kim. both men are in custody in jecheon after being arrested on sunday, police announced on tuesday. lee faces two charges of violating fire safety regulations and committing involuntary homicide by professional negligence, while kim also faces the involuntary homicide charge. if convicted of involuntary homicide, lee and kim could face up to five years in prison or 20 million won ($16,000) in fines.   the sprinkler system on the building s first floor did not work properly when the fire erupted,  a police detective, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak on an ongoing investigation, told reuters.  if the sprinkler system worked, the fire probably would not have spread as fast as it did.  police said on tuesday that lee has retained a lawyer but declined to name the lawyer or firm. police said kim has not yet hired a lawyer. photos released by the yonhap news agency showed a smoke stained stairwell and a fire exit filled with shelves and supplies on the second floor, where most of the deaths occurred.  the emergency exit on the building s second floor was blocked by iron shelves and other miscellaneous items,  the detective confirmed. officials are still investigating the cause of the conflagration. according to police, both kim and lee had denied reports they were trying to remove ice on the ceiling of the first floor, where the fire appeared to have originated, but later changed their statements after police confronted them with evidence. the korea joongang daily newspaper reported on tuesday that lee had at one point told police he did not alert the women in the sauna because they were undressed, however, the police detective told reuters he could not confirm that as investigations were ongoing. anger mounted over the weekend at reports of shoddy construction, broken doors, blocked roads and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths. a number of cars parked along the narrow roads around the building impeded the ability of firefighters to reach the fire, an official with the jecheon fire department told reuters, but noted that none of the parked vehicles appeared to have violated parking rules.  although vehicles can park there legally, it was quite difficult for fire trucks to go through to get to the scene, because the road was too narrow,  said the fire official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly. visiting the scene on friday, president moon jae in promised a full investigation.  the government as a whole will thoroughly probe this accident s cause and process of response, and although after the fact, the investigation and measures will be such that, at least, there will not be lingering deep sorrow,  he said. on monday, a separate fire at a construction site at an apartment complex south of seoul killed one person and injured 14 others, according to yonhap.

" democratic new york city mayor bill de blasio scored a decisive victory on tuesday in his bid to secure a second four year term in charge of the united states’ biggest city. with more than 75 percent of the city’s voting precincts reporting, de blasio, 56, had won nearly 65 percent, a margin of 35 percentage points over his republican opponent, state assemblywoman nicole malliotakis, according to new york city’s board of elections. the new york times and other media called the race for de blasio. de blasio, who held a comfortable lead in opinion polls leading up to election day, had been widely expected to cruise to victory in a city of 8.5 million people dominated by democratic voters.  a progressive liberal, de blasio in the past week campaigned with u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, an independent. sanders backed de blasio’s call for a tax hike on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in albany. the mayor has positioned himself as one of the most vocal critics of republican president donald trump, who has received strong disapproval ratings from voters in his native city. daisy taberas, 71, who immigrated from peru 48 years ago, said she voted for de blasio because of her concerns over trump’s stance on immigration. “i like the way (de blasio) works with children in the schools, and he’s trying to protect the city and he cares about immigration,” taberas said after casting her ballot at a manhattan polling site.  de blasio has taken heat for problems in the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the united states. the mayor, who has faced complaints over rising disruptions and delays on the subway system, has emphasized that it is run by a state controlled authority, not the city. he has also been plagued by accusations of a pay to play culture within city hall. a former donor, jona rechnitz, recently testified at the corruption trial of a union boss that he established a direct line to the de blasio administration after raising money for the mayor’s election campaign in 2013. after years of investigation, federal prosecutors said in march they would not charge de blasio, a point he reiterated on the campaign trail. the mayor campaigned on his efforts to increase affordable housing, establish universal pre kindergarten for 4 year olds and maintain the city’s historically low crime rates.

" mexican president enrique pena nieto on friday asked senate lawmakers to include civil society s views in their discussion of a divisive bill that critics say would give the military greater powers and deepen its role in the country s drug war. the bill, which enjoys cross partisan support, aims to regulate federal defense forces  involvement in the drug war, which has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade.  but the united nations, amnesty international and mexican human rights organization have all criticized the bill for prioritizing the military instead of seeking to improve mexico s police. pena nieto s unusual comments reflect the growing international pressure his government has come under over.  i d like to make a call to the senate to broaden the space for dialogue with civil society organizations in order to hear all voices and enrich what will eventually be decided,  the president said at a human rights event in mexico city. the bill has already passed the lower house, and is due to be discussed in the senate next week, but could potentially be delayed in the wake of pena nieto s comments. lawmakers who support the bill say it will give clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime. however, rights campaigners worry the law opens the door to military intervention in protests, as well as expanding military powers to spy on citizens. it is opposed by the party of leftist presidential frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador, which has only a handful of senators. the bill comes during a particularly violent year, with the 2017 murder tally almost certain to be the highest since modern records began twenty years ago.

" president donald trump warned on tuesday that all options are on the table for the united states to respond to north korea s firing of a ballistic missile over northern japan s hokkaido island into the sea in a new show of force. the missile test further increased tension in east asia as u.s. and south korean forces conducted annual military exercises on the korean peninsula, angering pyongyang which sees the war games as a preparation for invasion. north korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests under its leader, kim jong un, in defiance of u.n. sanctions, but firing projectiles over mainland japan is rare. trump, who has vowed not to let north korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the mainland united states, said the world had received north korea s latest message  loud and clear .  threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the north korean regime s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. all options are on the table,  trump said in a statement. trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe spoke and agreed that north korea  poses a grave and growing direct threat  to the united states, japan and south korea, the white house said. investors flocked to safe haven assets after the missile firing. the dollar fell to its lowest in more than 2 1/2 years against a basket of major currencies .dxy but then rebounded, while benchmark 10 year u.s. treasury note us10yt=rr yields fell and the price of gold xau= hit more than a nine month peak. u.s. stocks .spx recovered from a sharply lower open.  initial assessment indicates the north korean missile was an intermediate range ballistic missile (irbm), the pentagon said in a statement. two u.s. officials said it appeared to be a kn 17, or hwasong 12. north korea s kim guided a launch of its hwasong 12 intermediate range ballistic missile on tuesday in a drill to counter the joint exercises by south korean and u.s. militaries, the north s official kcna news agency said on wednesday.  the current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the kpa in the pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing guam,  kcna quoted kim as saying. pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning said diplomacy was still washington s preferred option with pyongyang. north korea was defiant.  the u.s. should know that it can neither browbeat the dprk with any economic sanctions and military threats and blackmail nor make the dprk flinch from the road chosen by itself,  north korea s official rodong sinmun said, using the initials of the north s official name, the democratic people s republic of korea. the north vows to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the united states and its allies. the united states has said before that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. the united states is technically still at war with the north because their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. relations worsened last year when north korea staged two nuclear bomb tests. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said the launch was  absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible  and that the security council now needed to take serious action. saying  enough is enough,  haley said she hoped china and russia would continue to work with the rest of the security council when it meets on tuesday afternoon to discuss what more can be done about north korea s nuclear and missile programs. the security council earlier this month unanimously imposed new sanctions on north korea after it staged two long range missile launches in july.          in response to trump s statement that all options are on the table, russian u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia told reporters:  it s troubling, because tensions are high and whose nerves are stronger, we don t know.  a u.s. official denied a report by japan s nikkei newspaper that the united states and japan will call at tuesday s meeting for an international embargo on oil exports to north korea. securing diplomatic agreement to such a ban would likely be extraordinarily difficult. diplomats say china and russia typically only view a test of a long range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible u.n. sanctions. negotiations on the past three substantial u.n. sanctions resolutions have taken between one and three months. the united states has proposed that the security council adopt a statement on tuesday condemning north korea s ballistic missile launch and imploring  all states to strictly, fully, and expeditiously implement  u.n. sanctions on pyongyang, according to a copy of the draft statement seen by reuters.  the draft statement does not threaten new security council action against north korea. in china, north korea s lone major ally, foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the crisis was  approaching a critical juncture , but it might also be a turning point to open the door to peace talks. the launch was north korea s second since u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson appeared to make a peace overture last week, by welcoming what he called the restraint pyongyang had shown by not conducting tests for several weeks. trump also expressed optimism last week about a possible improvement in relations, saying of north korea s kim:  i respect the fact that he is starting to respect us.     some experts in asia said kim was trying to pressure washington to get to the negotiating table with the latest missile tests.  (north korea) thinks that by exhibiting their capability, the path to dialogue will open,  said masao okonogi, professor emeritus at japan s keio university. high flying missilesouth korea s military said the missile was launched from near the north korean capital, pyongyang, just before 6 a.m. (2100 gmt on monday) and flew 2,700 km (1,680 miles), reaching an altitude of about 550 km (340 miles). four south korean fighter jets bombed a military firing range on tuesday after president moon jae in asked the military to demonstrate capabilities to counter north korea. south korea and the united states had discussed deploying additional  strategic assets  on the korean peninsula, south korea s presidential blue house said in a statement, without giving more details. earlier this month, north korea threatened to fire four missiles into the sea near the u.s. pacific territory of guam after trump said it would face  fire and fury  if it threatened the united states. north korea fired what it said was a rocket carrying a communications satellite into orbit over japan in 2009 after warning of its plan. the united states, japan and south korea considered it a ballistic missile test. the latest missile fell into the sea 1,180 km (735 miles) east of hokkaido, the japanese government said. in many northern japanese towns, sirens wailed and loudspeakers urged residents to take precautions, sending some scrambling to leave their houses while others confessed they had no idea what they should do.

" a group of south korean businessmen who own factories in the kaesong industrial complex inside north korea said on wednesday they want to visit to verify the north s claim that it had restarted some operations there on its own. south korea pulled out of the joint venture last year in response to the north s nuclear and missile tests, ending more than a decade of cooperation at the factory park, on the north s side of the demilitarized zone (dmz), that was the last remaining symbol of inter korean cooperation.  north korea s state run web sites said on friday north korean workers were operating in the district, adding that it was  nobody s business what we do in an industrial complex where our nation s sovereignty is exercised . the south koreans said they would ask the ministry of unification for permission to visit.  south koreans have to obtain approval to contact north koreans or travel in the country. the two sides are technically still at war after their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty.   we urge the north to immediately halt the operation of any of our corporate assets,  said shin han yong, the leader of the group, who used to operate a plant making fishing nets in kaesong. in recent weeks, north korea has launched two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, a sign that it may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said last weekend that washington was directly communicating with the north on its weapons programs but that it had shown no interest in dialogue. when the south suspended the operations at the industrial park, it said the north had diverted wages paid to its workers by south korean firms to fund its nuclear and missile programs. but in july, two months after liberal president moon jae in was elected in the south, a government official said there was no hard evidence to back up the assertion. moon had initially sought to engage north korea in talks and cooperation, but current political tensions have tied the president s hands. despite military tension, the businessmen s visit, if it comes off, may provide a chance to restart talks with the north, shin said.  we don t know if the north will accept our trip at a time when it only sees the u.s. as its dialogue partner, but we are pinning our hopes on a one in ten chance that may exist,  he said.

" the u.s. house of representatives on friday approved legislation to continue a federal insurance program for millions of lower income children and pregnant women, but with an ongoing funding battle it could be weeks before the program gets more money. the house republican measure was approved 242 174 largely along party lines. it would continue the children’s health insurance program (chip) for five years. but democrats warned the partisan house approach would not fly in the senate, further delaying cash for the program that expired over a month ago. “this bill is going nowhere ... the senate will not take it up, and we will be waiting around until christmas” to get funding, democratic representative frank pallone warned.  republicans control 52 of the senate’s 100 seats, and 60 votes are needed for passage there. chip, which provides health insurance to about 9 million children, has been a bipartisan program since its creation 20 years ago and reauthorizing funding has not been contentious   until now. under president donald trump and a republican controlled congress, healthcare issues have become highly politicized as republicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace obamacare, a top trump campaign promise. the program’s funding lapsed on sept. 30, but most states have enough money to continue it past 2017. still, 11 states, including colorado, california, utah, ohio and pennsylvania expect to exhaust their funding by the end of the year, according to the kaiser family foundation. another 21 states anticipate running out of money by the end of march 2018. the house bill extends the program for five years, and continues funding of community health centers for two years. it also includes $1 billion for medicaid programs in puerto rico and the virgin islands, hard hit by recent hurricanes. the bill became controversial after republicans added provisions that would affect the affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. they include slashing funding from the law’s prevention and public health fund, which among other things helps fight the opioid epidemic, and making it easier to kick people off obamacare plans for non payment of premiums. however, republican representative greg walden pointed out the bill would block for two years the medicaid cuts for hospitals that would otherwise occur under obamacare.  democrats criticized the legislation for asking medicare’s wealthiest one percent of beneficiaries, those who make more than $40,000 each month, to pay more to help fund health insurance for low income children.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that the senate would have a final vote on april 7 on president donald trump’s nominee for the supreme court, neil gorsuch, even as more democrats opposed his confirmation the gorsuch nomination, mcconnell told reporters, will hit the senate floor next week after the senate judiciary committee on monday approves him. mcconnell added that gorsuch will be “confirmed on friday” of next week. senate republicans continued to put the pressure on democrats to lend enough support to colorado appeals court judge gorsuch to avoid a showdown that in turn could trigger mcconnell to seek a change in senate rules that would clear away a democratic blockade against the nomination. so far, about 26 of the 48 democratic senators have publicly announced opposition to gorsuch. most of that group backs a growing effort to block a confirmation vote through the use of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster. sixty votes in the 100 seat senate would be needed to stop a filibuster and allow a confirmation vote on gorsuch. the confirmation would require a simple majority in favor. republicans control the senate 52 48. some senate republican aides suggested that if democrats block a confirmation vote, mcconnell might move quickly to change the rules. it was unclear, however, if he had enough votes to do so democratic senate leader chuck schumer told reporters that gorsuch will face an uphill climb to get the 60 votes he would need to avoid a showdown over senate rules. “the bottom line is very simple, and that is that gorsuch did not acquit himself well at the hearings and did not impress our caucus,” schumer said, accusing gorsuch of siding with  powerful interests and expressing concerns about his independence from the president. “it’s going to be a real uphill climb for him to get those 60 votes,” schumer told reporters. trump is seeking to avoid another setback in congress after major healthcare legislation he supported was pulled from the house of representatives floor amid opposition within his own party on friday.  the confirmation of gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine seat court’s conservative majority, a major campaign promise for trump. the senate judiciary committee oversaw a four day confirmation hearing for gorsuch last week.

" afghan and u.s. military authorities are investigating reports that as many as 13 civilians were killed in an operation in the northern region of kunduz, officials said on monday, but details remain sketchy three days after the incident. there were conflicting reports of the casualty numbers in friday s incident in the district of chahardara outside kunduz. a local council member said 13 people were killed, but a spokesman for the provincial governor said it was just one. however, the incident underlines the risk of increased civilian casualties from the recent u.s. decision to step up air strikes and special forces operations in afghanistan to break a stalemate with taliban militants.  there is a need for a proper investigation to prove these allegations and we will launch it soon,  ghulam qader akbari, the governor of chahardara, said on monday. on saturday, the nato led resolute support mission in kabul confirmed the incident had occurred in kunduz and said an investigation had begun, but gave no details.  we are aware of allegations regarding the potential for civilian casualties as the result of a combined operation in northern afghanistan,  resolute support spokesman capt tom gresback said in a statement.  resolute support takes all allegations of civilian casualties and the responsibility of human life seriously, and is assessing the facts surrounding this incident.  khosh bawar nasratyar, a member of the local provincial council, said 13 people had been killed by u.s. airstrikes in the district. but nematullah temor, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said only one civilian had been killed and six wounded when coalition forces hit a car taking people to the villages of ghar o qeshlaq and qatl e am to evacuate taliban casualties. he said other reports of civilian casualties were  untrue and baseless . afghan special forces said 48 insurgents had been killed in chahardara but denied any civilian casualties, saying the area had been evacuated before the operation. but graphic pictures purporting to show the aftermath of the incident, and unconfirmed reports that as many as 60 people had been killed, were widely shared on social media, highlighting the risk that public opinion could turn decisively against the government over the issue. the most recent united nations civilian casualty figures, released last month, show air strikes drove a rise of 52 percent in the first nine months of 2017, to 205 killed and 261 injured, versus the corresponding period last year. former president hamid karzai, who clashed bitterly with the united states over civilian casualties when he was in power, condemned the incident, but there was no comment from the government of president ashraf ghani.

" the european union s chief brexit negotiator said on thursday he was worried by britain s plans for the border arrangement with ireland after it leaves the eu and urged london to come up with  creative proposals . the comments from michel barnier highlighted the gulf between the two sides on one of the trickiest issues thrown up by brexit   how it will affect the currently seamless movement of people and goods between the republic of ireland, which is an eu member, and british ruled northern ireland. britain said last month that there should be no border posts or immigration checks along the 500 km (300 mile) frontier after brexit. some 30,000 people make the crossing each day, and businesses from farming to brewing depend on easy movement of goods between north and south. while brussels and dublin also say they want to keep an open border, they say britain has failed to explain how it would square this with its stated intention to leave the eu s customs union.  what i see in the uk s paper on ireland and northern ireland worries me,  barnier told a news conference in brussels.  the uk wants the eu to suspend the application of its laws, its customs union and its single market at what will be a new external border for the eu, and the uk wants to use ireland as a kind of test case for the future eu uk customs relations. this will not happen,  barnier said. the eu is also concerned that britain could use the border between the two irelands as a way to circumvent tariffs that could be imposed in a post brexit eu uk trade deal. barnier s remarks coincided with the publication of a set of  principles from the european commission, the eu s executive, on how the irish issue should be dealt with. it explicitly stated that the  onus to propose solutions  on ireland fell on britain. the paper also made it clear that a hard border between ireland and northern ireland should be avoided to protect peace on the island. it said that  any physical border infrastructure  should be ruled out, but that required  flexible and imaginative solutions . nearly three months into brexit talks, eu and britain negotiators have made little progress on the irish border and the other issues   expatriate citizens  rights and the bill that london should pay its eu partners to settle existing financial commitments   that brussels wants broadly solved before talks on a future trading relationship can start.  the irish government called on britain to make  substantive commitments  and provide  workable solutions . prime minister leo varadkar reiterated that for all sides to achieve their aim of avoiding a hard border, britain needed to stay in the customs union or in a similar arrangement for at least a post brexit transition phase. britain seized on the eu comments about the need for an open border as evidence that british and eu objectives were  closely aligned .  in particular the commitment to avoid any physical infrastructure at the border is a very important step forward,  a government spokesman said, adding that the position papers from both sides  clearly provide a good basis on which to continue to make swift progress.

" a bosnian serb man was arrested after trying to sell an original document from the 1995 dayton peace agreement that ended bosnia s war, police said on wednesday. the document had gone missing a decade ago. media identified the man as zeljko kuntos, a former driver for a bosnian serb ex parliament speaker, and said he had been trying to sell the document for 100,000 bosnian marka ($60,000). the u.s. brokered peace treaty that ended the war was reached at a u.s. air base in dayton, ohio in november 1995 by the then presidents of bosnia, serbia and croatia, the three sides involved in the conflict in which more than 100,000 died. under the treaty, bosnia was split into two autonomous regions, the federation shared by the bosnian croats and muslim bosniaks, and the serb dominated serb republic.  the person z.k., who obtained during 2017 the original document written in english of the dayton peace agreement, is suspected of offering it for sale in order to gain illegal benefits,  police said in a statement. they gave no further details. in 2008, a then presidency member revealed that the original document of the peace treaty in english was missing.  kuntos was arrested on thursday in pale, the bosnian serb wartime stronghold near sarajevo.  it is not clear how he obtained the document.

" china accused the united states on thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after u.s. president donald trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible u.s. navy visits to self ruled taiwan. tensions have risen in recent days after a senior chinese diplomat threatened china would invade taiwan if any u.s. warships made port visits to the island which china claims as its own territory. on monday, chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. on tuesday, trump signed into law the national defense authorization act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between taiwan and the united states. such visits would be the first since the united states ended formal diplomatic relations with taiwan in 1979 and established ties with beijing. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said while the taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  one china  policy and  constitute an interference in china s internal affairs .   china is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the u.s. government,  lu told a daily news briefing. china is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between taiwan and the united states, he added.  proudly democratic taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in china s military deployments as irresponsible. taiwan presidential spokesman alex huang, speaking to taiwan media in comments reported late on wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , huang said. both sides of the narrow taiwan strait, which separates taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  huang was quoted as saying. relations have soured considerably since tsai ing wen, who leads taiwan s independence leaning democratic progressive party, won presidential elections last year. china suspects tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for beijing. tsai says she wants to maintain peace with china but will defend taiwan s security. taiwan is well equipped with mostly u.s. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from china. the united states is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. china has never renounced the use of force to bring taiwan under its control.

" president donald trump pledged to uphold americans’ right to possess guns on friday in a speech that he used to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing a democratic senator as “pocahontas.” trump pledged his allegiance to the powerful national rifle association, the country’s leading gun rights advocacy group, at a convention attended by thousands. elected in part on a law and order platform, trump was the first sitting president to address the nra since fellow republican ronald reagan in 1983. “as your president, i will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms,” trump told thousands of people attending the nra’s annual convention in atlanta, georgia. trump, whose candidacy last year was endorsed by the nra, marks his first 100 days in office on saturday with no major legislative achievements but with a long litany of actions to loosen federal regulations and review free trade agreements. stymied by his initial bid to build a wall along the u.s. mexican border when congress balked at funding the initiative, trump vowed he will sooner or later build the wall, which had been a signature campaign promise. “we need a wall. we’ll build the wall. don’t even think about it,” he said. politics and his unexpected election victory on nov. 8 over democrat hillary clinton also featured prominently in his remarks. speculating on who might run for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, trump brought up the name of u.s. senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and used a derogatory nickname he had adopted for her last year. “it may be pochahontas, and she is not big on the nra,” trump said of warren, who had once said she had some native american ancestry. pocahontas is a legendary native american figure from the 1600s. trump later attended a fund raiser for republican candidate karen handel, who will face democrat jon ossoff on june 20 to determine who will win a house of representatives seat to replace tom price, who became trump’s health and human services secretary. trump, at the nra event, returned time and again to the theme of responsible gun ownership. “you have a true friend and champion in the white house,” he said. “we want to assure you of the sacred right of self defense for all of our citizens.” ",0

" former fbi chief james comey will likely hold back from accusing president donald trump of trying to interfere with an  investigation into links between trump’s election campaign team and russian officials when he testifies in congress this week, legal sources said. comey’s highly anticipated appearance before the senate intelligence committee on thursday could be a turning point in a controversy that has rocked trump’s young administration. in his first public remarks since trump fired him last month, comey is expected to tell the senate intelligence committee that trump asked him during a meeting in the oval office to end the federal bureau of investigation’s probe into ties between former white house national security adviser michael flynn and russia. comey may also detail other conversations with trump.  two legal experts said comey would seek to avoid compromising a new inquiry led by special counsel robert mueller or separate congressional investigations. “i would expect him to hew pretty closely to facts and events,” said jack sharman, a partner at lightfoot, franklin and white and former special counsel to a congressional committee that investigated president bill clinton in the 1990s. another source, who asked not to be named, said comey does not see it as his role to charge the president or anyone else with obstruction of justice or any other crime. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded in a report declassified in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the u.s. electoral system, but to affect the election’s outcome. comey told the house of representatives intelligence committee on march 20 that the fbi was probing moscow’s role in the election, including possible trump campaign collusion. trump fired comey on may 9, a step that stunned washington and intensified scrutiny of the matter. michael flynn, trump’s national security adviser, was fired in february. the white house said he had misled vice president mike pence about contacts flynn had with russia’s ambassador to the united states, sergei kislyak, before trump took office. federal prosecutors last month issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with flynn when he was a private citizen.  the senate intelligence panel also issued its first subpoena in its russia investigation, demanding documents from flynn. the first roughly 600 pages of those documents were delivered on tuesday.

" the largest program of the clinton foundation, the family philanthropy of u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on friday. it was reported on thursday that the clinton foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if clinton wins the election in november, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe straddling charity might inappropriately seek white house favors in return. but representatives of the charities confirmed on friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundation’s activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development. the clinton health access initiative (chai), the foundation’s flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life saving hiv medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors. “chai is a separate legal entity from the clinton foundation with its own board,” regan lachapelle, a chai spokeswoman, said in an email. “the chai board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.”  chai accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundation’s most recent annual report posted on its website. chai files separate tax returns from the clinton foundation, but is included in the foundation’s audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature. similarly, a canadian offshoot of the foundation, the clinton giustra enterprise partnership (canada), or cgep, will not be bound by the foundation’s donor limits, but said it will instead become an “independent entity” if hillary clinton becomes president. cgep, which says canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donors’ names without their permission, was founded by bill clinton, the former u.s. president, and canadian businessman frank giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries.  “if secretary clinton wins the election, we plan to spin cgep into an independent entity to continue this important work,” giustra said in a statement. “president clinton and i believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world.” the statement did not specify bill clinton’s future role. a spokesman for clinton’s campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. the charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of hiv, and clinton’s campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided. the family renamed their foundation the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation in 2013, although hillary clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. her husband and daughter remain board members. in 2008, hillary clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family’s charities in order to become president barack obama’s secretary of state. she promised that her family’s charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the u.s. state department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming “oversights.” on tuesday, the boston globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. “even if they’ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,” the editorial board wrote.

" india s main opposition congress party on monday elevated rahul gandhi, the scion of the country s most fabled political dynasty, as its president, preparing to challenge the dominance of prime minister narendra modi ahead of national polls in 2019. in a long awaited move, gandhi, the great grandson of india s founding prime minister jawaharlal nehru, was elected unopposed to head the party. he will take the reins from his mother sonia, the party s longest serving president, since 1998. calling it a  historic occasion , the congress party said gandhi would take charge as president on dec. 16. television broadcast images of party supporters celebrating and distributing sweets outside congress offices in the capital, new delhi, and the financial hub of mumbai. gandhi s ascent coincides with state polls in modi s western home state of gujarat that are shaping as a test for the prime minister, who has been facing criticism for softening economic growth and poor implementation of a nationwide sales tax. the congress hopes a round of state elections offers the party, and gandhi, a shot at revival ahead of the next national elections, due in 2019.     modi s depiction of gandhi as an undeserving  prince  has helped sideline gandhi since the last national election, during which time congress has suffered some of its worst results in local elections. the nehru gandhi family has ruled the country for most of its 70 years since independence from britain. gandhi s father and grandmother were both prime ministers, and both assassinated. following congress  defeat in the 2014 polls, gandhi struggled to convince voters, as well as many within his party, of his leadership skills. but senior congress leader ghulam nabi azad said gandhi was now ready for the next challenge.  the entire country has lots of expectations from rahul gandhi,  azad said.  much before he was elected he has shown his mettle. he knows his responsibility.      modi s bharatiya janata party (bjp) swiftly dismissed gandhi s election, saying he had become president only on the basis of  dynastic principle .   the new india is loath to (accept) dynastic principle and the family character of the congress further diminishes its appeal,  bjp spokesman g.v.l. narasimha rao told reuters. gandhi, until now a vice president of congress, is widely seen as a prime ministerial candidate if the party returns to power one day.  the 47 year old has increasingly gone public in slamming modi s governance since the last national polls, as he looks to shed the reticent image that has for years been synonymous with his political dynasty. but he has also faced political backlash. in 2015, for example, he took nearly two months of leave, prompting modi s party to accuse him of  holidaying  while parliament was in session.   modi still trumps gandhi in popularity rankings, however. nearly nine of 10 indians have a favourable opinion of him and more than two thirds are satisfied with the direction in which he is taking the country, a pew survey found in november.  modi s favourable rating was 30 points more than gandhi s, it showed.

" the white house on tuesday denied that president donald trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the u.s. renewable fuels association (rfa) said trump’s team had informed the group an order was pending. trading in u.s. refinery shares, fuel futures and corn prices was turbulent on the news of the pending order and its subsequent denial, as investors puzzled over what it would mean for the price of gasoline, ethanol and shares of companies that produce them. the rfa issued a statement early on tuesday that said a member of the trump administration had called to inform the group the president intended to sign an executive order that would shift the onus on combining biofuels with gasoline away from refiners. the order would require companies further down the supply chain, such as retailers who sell gasoline, to shoulder that load. refiners have long requested this change, saying the biofuels program has hammered their profits.  white house spokeswoman kelly love, however, said on tuesday afternoon “there is no ethanol executive order in the works.” ethanol and fuel retail groups reacted quickly to the reports. trump’s regulation adviser, billionaire investor carl icahn, is majority owner of cvr energy (cvi.n), a refining company that would benefit from the change. that stock is up 80 percent since trump’s election in november. even after the white house denial, rfa chief executive officer bob dinneen stuck by his statement, saying there is “certainly something in the works, but they’re not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it.” he declined to identify who in the trump administration contacted the association. “despite our continued opposition to the move, we were told the executive order was not negotiable,” dinneen said. the renewable fuel standard requires fuel companies to use increasing amounts of biofuel blended with gasoline and diesel. former u.s. president barack obama expanded the rules, which started under his predecessor, george w. bush, when gasoline prices were near records. refineries without operations designed to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline have to pay for renewable fuel credits, known as rins, to meet u.s. environmental standards to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the cost for refiners has increased sharply in the last few years; nine major publicly traded refiners paid $2.5 billion in 2016 for rins costs, a 78 percent increase from 2015.  among those that have pushed for the change is icahn, who holds an 82 percent stake of cvr. that company’s shares jumped on tuesday before paring gains after the white house denial; they ended up 3.5 percent on the day to $22.92 a share, on heavier than usual trading volume of 1.7 million shares.  icahn was unavailable for comment, and cvr declined to comment.  emily skor, ceo of biofuel trade group growth energy, expressed concern about any role icahn may have played in planning changes to the program. “i assure you this is no deal for anyone but carl icahn,” she said. “if we had been approached with this deal, we would have flat out rejected it.”  seven democratic senators, including elizabeth warren of massachusetts, sent a letter to the white house this month, saying icahn’s role as an adviser to trump created financial conflicts of interest and called for a review.     shares of u.s. refiner valero (vlo.n), which would also benefit from the changes, ended up 1 percent on tuesday to close at $67.95 a share.  biofuel organizations and groups representing fuel retailers and integrated oil companies like the u.s. units of royal dutch shell plc (rdsa.l) and bp plc (bp.l) have opposed the change, which they say will complicate managing the program.  one source said the rfa was told the executive order would include incentives for ethanol and biodiesel in a tradeoff for the blending shift. those changes could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, a review of how the environmental protection agency estimates emission impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel, the source said. chicago board of trade corn futures cc1 ended up about 1.7 percent. cbot soyoil boc1, which is used for biodiesel, rose 4.8 percent.  compliance credits used to meet the annual biofuel blending standards traded around 43 cents on tuesday from 47 cents to 48 cents previously, paring big morning losses.

" former soccer star george weah leads in partial presidential election results in 11 of liberia s 15 counties, the electoral commission said on thursday, after a vote meant to bring about the country s first democratic transfer of power in decades. early results from tuesday s poll read to reporters by the commission s chairman left weah s camp confident he would win the outright majority he needs to avoid a run off, even though most counties had reported tallies from less than a third of polling stations. the other favorite in the 20 candidate field, vice president joseph boakai, led in just one county, although he was running in second in most others.   i can say for sure that ambassador george manneh weah is going to be the next president of the republic of liberia,  weah s adviser mulbah morlu told reuters.  the people of liberia have spoken.  the final results must be announced by oct. 25 and a run off will be held next month if no one has won a majority.   before the commission s announcement, parties backing three other candidates alleged fraud and vowed to contest the results. but international observers said they had seen no major problems with the vote.  the overall conduct of the voting was generally assessed as either good or very good,  the eu mission said in a statement on thursday. observers from the u.s. based carter center and national democratic institute (ndi) also said they had not identified any major issues with the voting or subsequent counting. the allegations of irregularities centered on charges that extra ballots were printed in advance and marked with votes for boakai from the ruling unity party of president ellen johnson sirleaf. however, none of the parties provided evidence of cheating. a unity party leader declined to respond to the accusations. earlier in the day, johnson sirleaf, who became africa s first elected female president when she won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post war transition, hailed the election as historic.   we believe that all liberians are ready for this process. i thank them for participating in this process,  she told reporters. liberia, africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer occurred in 1944.

" china s foreign ministry reiterated on thursday that it believes venezuela has the ability to handle its debt issue, after the oil rich country started making interest payments on bonds following a delay that had threatened to trigger a default. venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from russia and china, primarily through oil for loan deals that have crimped the country s hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.  on wednesday, venezuela won easier debt terms from russia, as well as a vote of confidence from china   two countries that could provide a lifeline as caracas seeks to keep its deeply depressed economy solvent. asked whether china was concerned that the debt would not be repaid, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing that china venezuela financial cooperation was proceeding as normal.  we believe that venezuela s government and people have the ability to properly handle their debt issue,  geng said.  venezuelan bond prices have been on a roller coaster over the past 10 days, as president nicolas maduro called investors to debt restructuring talks, while pledging to keep honoring the country s obligations. but s&p global ratings declared it in selective default on two of its sovereign bonds early this week after it failed to make the coupons within a 30 day grace period. on wednesday, the country s economy ministry said it had started transferring $200 million in interest payments on those bonds, which mature in 2019 and 2024.

" the kremlin said on tuesday that u.s. charges against president donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort and another aide showed moscow had been unfairly maligned in accusations that it meddled in last year s u.s. presidential election. federal investigators probing alleged russian interference in the election, something moscow denies, charged manafort and rick gates with money laundering on monday. but despite being brought as part of a five month old investigation into alleged russian efforts to tilt the election in trump s favor and into potential collusion by trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on manafort s work for ukraine s former government, not russia s. that was welcomed in russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher u.s. sanctions against moscow. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against russia in the indictment against manafort and gates, saying on tuesday that moscow had always said it had never interfered in the u.s. election. that assertion is challenged by u.s. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that moscow did interfere in the november 2016 vote.  ...russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. other countries and other people feature (in the charges),  peskov told a conference call with reporters.  moscow never felt itself guilty so it doesn t feel  exonerated now,  he said, when asked whether the kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the russian foreign ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the trump campaign through a third ex aide, george papadopoulos, who it was announced on monday pleaded guilty in early october to lying to the fbi.  russia s flagship tv news show took a similar line on monday evening, saying it was  now clear that there was nothing  to allegations about manafort being in touch with russian officials to try to sway the election.     the u.s. investigation was an internal matter for the united states, said peskov, but moscow was following it with interest. peskov laughed off the purported role of papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the trump campaign and the russian leadership. in his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, papadopoulos said he had met a london based professor boasting of contacts with russian officials and an unnamed russian woman. he also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the russian foreign ministry. peskov, when asked what the kremlin made of someone linked to the foreign ministry allegedly trying to set up a putin trump meeting, said:  it s an absolutely laughable allegation.  media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is ivan timofeev, who works for a moscow based think tank called the russian international relations council (riac).  timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in august that papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a trump trip to russia. timofeev said papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either riac or the russian foreign ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been  acting on his own initiative  and was  an enthusiast with little experience.  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters on tuesday that there was nothing  illegal  about papadopoulos contacting someone at riac.

" environmental group the sierra club sued the u.s. energy department on monday in hopes of forcing it to reveal the groups it has consulted in conducting an eagerly awaited study on the electricity grid. it was the latest push back on the department’s study from backers of renewable energy such as wind and solar power who fear it could be used by the trump administration to form policies that could slow growth in the industry.    energy secretary rick perry, who commissioned the 60 day study in april, ordered his department to see whether “regulatory burdens” by other administrations including former president barack obama’s had forced the premature retirements of so called baseload power plants, fired by nuclear and coal. perry said those policies potentially put at risk the reliability and security of the national power grid. the sierra club, in the suit filed monday in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california, said the department had ignored a freedom of information act request it filed in may. that request sought the release of communications between staff and outside groups it had consulted, in the belief that the energy department had mostly relied on fossil fuel backers. “we want to make sure that when this study is finally released, that the public and policy makers fully understand how it went about doing it, who they were influenced by, and whose views they did not take into consideration,” said casey roberts, a sierra club lawyer. the energy department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. it had initially said the report would be released in july, but the release has been delayed. a draft of the study, conducted by a contractor who included contributions from staff across the department, said that intermittent renewable power has not harmed the grid, was leaked to the media last month.  but an energy department spokeswoman said then that the draft was “outdated” and had not been reviewed by political or career staff, leading sierra club and others to believe the final draft could favor coal and nuclear. several lawmakers with strong renewable power output in their states have said that the energy department had already completed long term studies of renewable power’s impact on the grid that concluded there has been no harm. senator chuck grassley, a republican from iowa, raised concerns in a letter sent to perry in may that the secretary had commissioned a study that appeared “geared to undermine” the wind energy industry.

" two women accused of murdering the estranged half brother of north korean leader kim jong un with a banned nerve agent pleaded not guilty at the start of a high profile murder trial in a malaysian court on monday. indonesian siti aisyah, 25, and doan thi huong, 28, a vietnamese, are charged with killing kim jong nam by smearing his face with vx, a chemical poison banned by the united nations, at kuala lumpur airport on feb. 13. both women wore bullet proof vests as they were led into the court on the outskirts of the malaysian capital. they face the death penalty if convicted. police have also named four north koreans as suspects in the case and an interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the north koreans, who remain at large. defence lawyers demanded that the prosecution immediately name the four other suspects, who have also been charged, so they can prepare their case.  the charge must be clear,  said siti aisyah s lawyer, gooi soon seng. judge azmi ariffin dismissed their request. the two women nodded their heads when the charges were read out by two interpreters. they pleaded not guilty. the prosecution said the women s actions showed  intent to kill the victim  by smearing his face and eyes with vx nerve agent, which a malaysian post mortem confirmed had killed kim. the women told their lawyers they did not know they were participating in a deadly attack and believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality tv show.  the prank practice carried out by the first and second accused with the supervision of the four who are still at large was preparation to see through their common intention to kill the victim,  lead prosecutor muhamad iskandar ahmad said in his opening statement. the two women sat quietly in the packed courtroom. siti was dressed in a black floral suit, while huong wore a white long sleeved t shirt and jeans.  juliana idris, who works at the airport, told the court a man later identified as kim jong nam approached her and asked her to take him to a police station.  she said the man, who spoke english, told her he had been  attacked by a woman from behind ... another one closed his eyes .  his hands were shaking a bit, i don t know why,  she said. police lance corporal mohd zulkarnain sanudin, who was on duty at the airport, said juliana had brought kim jong nam to him. he said kim told him a substance had been wiped on his face. kim s eyes were red and he could see some liquid on his face, zulkarnain said. he also said the he had wrongly recorded kim jong nam s nationality as south korean.  the police report i made showed the nationality as south korean, while on the passport, it was written dpr korea, whereby i did not know what dpr meant. i was only sure that korea was south korea,  he told the court. dprk are the initials for north korea s official name, the democratic republic of north korea. other witnesses described how kim jong nam had seizures at the clinic   his eyes rolled upwards and there was drooling of saliva and mucus. rabiatul adawiyah mohd sofi, a medical assistant, said kim jong nam was at the clinic for just over an hour and moved to a hospital. by the time they arrived at the hospital emergency ward, they could not get a blood pressure reading, she said.  there was a high probability that there was either a problem with our monitor or the patient had died,  said rabiatul. the case continues on tuesday.

" the u.s. justice department has launched a 12 city partnership to combat spikes in violent crime as part of president donald trump’s vow to support law enforcement, attorney general jeff sessions said on tuesday. the program features a three year initiative to help coordinate crime fighting efforts among federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement and prosecutors, sessions said in unveiling the new national public safety partnership. trump, a republican, made tough on crime rhetoric a focus of his 2016 campaign. the new program stems from an executive order he signed in february mandating that the justice department provide support for local law enforcement. “we have a duty to make sure our country does not abandon all the progress we have made against crime over the past few decades,” sessions said at a national meeting of law enforcement officials. his remarks were released by the justice department. sessions did not disclose any new funding for the initiative, which will focus on gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence. the federal government will provide help in areas that include training, crime analysis, gun violence, community engagement and investigations. a spike in violent crime in 2015 continued into the first half of last year, with big cities seeing an average increase in murders of almost 22 percent compared with the same period the year before, sessions said. the dozen cities chosen for the program are birmingham, alabama; indianapolis; memphis, tennessee; toledo, ohio; baton rouge, louisiana; buffalo, new york; cincinnati; houston; jackson, tennessee; kansas city, missouri; lansing, michigan; and springfield, illinois.  sessions said more communities could be announced for the partnership this year. the 12 cities were picked because they have levels of violence well above the national average and are ready to receive training and aid, justice department spokesman devin o’malley said. federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials also helped choose them, he said. chicago and nine other cities that were in a pilot program called the violence reduction network will also take part in the initiative. trump had vowed in january to bring federal intervention to bear to quell gun violence in chicago.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on wednesday dashed any remaining hopes that president barack obama’s signature pacific rim trade deal would come up for a vote before president elect donald trump takes office in january. “it’s certainly not going to be brought up this year,” mcconnell said of the 12 country trans pacific partnership (tpp) at a news briefing in washington. mcconnell said any decisions on tpp or other future trade agreements would be up to trump, who would still have the authority for four more years to negotiate “better deals” with expedited approval procedures in congress. trump excoriated tpp on the campaign trail as a “disaster” and “a rape of our country,” tapping into populist anger at globalization, trade and manufacturing job losses that helped propel his candidacy. in an opinion piece published on monday, trump advisers peter navarro and alexander gray reiterated his opposition to major trade deals.   “trump will never again sacrifice the u.s. economy on the altar of foreign policy by entering into bad trade deals like the north american free trade agreement, allowing china into the world trade organization, and passing the proposed tpp,” navarro and gray wrote in foreign policy magazine. “these deals only weaken our manufacturing base and ability to defend ourselves and our allies.”  the obama administration has been promoting tpp among lawmakers and industry groups in anticipation of a long shot, post election vote despite opposition to the deal by trump and his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. while there are many republican supporters of free trade and tpp in congress, mcconnell and house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on wednesday they were now focused on laying the groundwork with trump to pass republican focused healthcare and tax reform legislation next year. a spokeswoman for ryan said he had not had a change of heart since he said on a radio talk show in october that the house would not bring tpp up for a vote because of problems with several provisions and insufficient support in the house. mcconnell said his priorities for the post election “lame duck” session were passing a government funding extension and medical innovation legislation. white house spokesman josh earnest was still trying to sell the tpp agreement in a news briefing on wednesday. “president obama does continue to believe that this is the best opportunity that the congress has to take advantage of the benefits of a trans pacific partnership agreement that cuts taxes, 18,000 taxes, that other countries impose on american products,” earnest told reporters. “we’ve got a strong case to make.” but the strong vote for trump in industrial states made it unlikely republicans would be willing to go against him on trade policy, analysts said. “it’s fair to say that tpp is now in the dustbin of history,” said gary hufbauer, a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics, a pro trade think tank in washington. “i don’t see a path forward for the united states to join.” ",0
" transylvania may not seem everyone s idea of a fun weekend away to get over a painful break up but that is jean claude juncker s prescription for eu leaders to cope with the blues on the day britain walks out. sibiu, the picturesque historic home of romania s ethnic germans, will be just the place for the other 27 national leaders to make a public show of unity on saturday, march 30, 2019, the european commission president told eu lawmakers on wednesday in his annual state of the european union address. his proposals for a more united bloc without britain face scepticism from many governments. but the eu s chief executive has, officials said, calculated that expanding the euro zone and deepening its cooperation can win support from angela merkel and emmanuel macron, leaders of the founding powers france and germany, and heal rifts with newer, poorer members in the east. his mention of brexit brought cheers from uk independence party members in strasbourg. they scoffed at juncker s warning that britons would soon regret leaving and said ukip would look forward to that weekend 18 months hence to celebrate britain s  liberation  from what they call eu diktat from brussels. but aides say juncker believes many of the 440 million other europeans will only truly wake up to the fact the second ranked economy is leaving pretty much around when it actually happens.  and to reassure them at what juncker said would be  a very sad and tragic moment , their leaders should plan a get together in romania, one of the newest, and poorest member states, which just happens to be the rotating chair of the eu in early 2019. a rich cultural heritage   juncker noted that german speakers like himself know it as hermannstadt, capital of transylvania s centuries old saxon community   makes sibiu a good spot to celebrate the union of europe s diverse peoples.  the whole idea on that day is to focus on...matters to come for the union, not on the ones who are leaving,  one senior eu official said of the sibiu summit, which was welcomed by romanian president klaus ioannis, a former mayor of the city. and if hostile british commentators might be tempted to link the transylvanian venue to a view of the eu as a bloodsucking vampire on the british taxpayer, romanian locals insist their town has little to do with the region s dracula legend. aside from altering the atmospherics of what will certainly be a historic weekend for the european union, the success of juncker s vision for sibiu in 2019 will depend on how national leaders respond to the proposals he sketched out on wednesday. most strikingly, the former luxembourg premier who will step down in autumn 2019, wants to use the departure of the union s opter out in chief, britain, to end a culture of states picking and choosing which bits of integration they want   for themselves and others   and to bring all 27 or more nations in to the euro currency zone, schengen travel area and bank union. in a speech that carefully balanced indirect criticisms and praise for different leaders across the bloc, he slapped down macron s embryonic proposals for a separate euro zone budget and plans to push ahead with deeper integration that could leave non euro countries, especially in the east, on the eu s fringes. the german government, preparing for an election in two weeks that should hand merkel a fourth term, is skeptical of macron s plans but is also likely to be wary of the ambition of juncker s proposals. its initial reaction was restrained. eu officials, however, play down the idea that juncker is making for a head on confrontation with merkel and macron when he sets his face against a  multispeed europe  that the veteran eu dealmaker believes bears the seeds of the eu s unraveling. rather, juncker sees his idea of a euro zone covering the whole eu, with its budget part of the overall eu budget and run from the existing commission, as a practical application of the kind of suggestions macron and merkel seem to support but on which their administrations have offered little concrete detail. at the same time, eu officials argue, past attempts by paris and berlin to force a lead on integration, such as by merkel and then president nicolas sarkozy at the height of the euro zone crisis in 2011, failed to gain traction. juncker, they say, will try to persuade them that his broader approach is more viable. nonetheless, his suggestion that the likes of poland and hungary, run by deeply eurosceptic governments, should join the strictures of the euro zone is unlikely to win rapid support in warsaw or budapest. juncker s argument is, however, that if they refuse offers and pressure to join, they cannot then complain about being treated as  second class  members of the union. juncker, 62, said he had despaired of the eu at times but wants sibiu to offer eu voters something other than brexit to wake up to, two months before a european parliament election. the biggest challenge to achieving his long list of ambitions by then will be overcoming entrenched national interests:  democracy is about compromise,  he said in a blunt warning to the squabbling leaders he wants to come together in transylvania.  europe cannot function without compromise.

" a federal judge in wisconsin dealt the first legal blow to president donald trump’s revised travel ban on friday, barring enforcement of the policy to deny u.s. entry to the wife and child of a syrian refugee already granted asylum in the united states. the temporary restraining order, granted by u.s. district judge william conley in madison, applies only to the family of the syrian refugee, who brought the case anonymously to protect the identities of his wife and daughter, still living in the war torn syrian city of aleppo. but it represents the first of several challenges brought against trump’s newly amended executive order, issued on march 6 and due to go into effect on march 16, to draw a court ruling in opposition to its enforcement. conley, chief judge of the federal court in wisconsin’s western district and an appointee of former president barack obama, concluded the plaintiff “has presented some likelihood of success on the merits” of his case and that his family faces “significant risk of irreparable harm” if forced to remain in syria. the plaintiff, a sunni muslim, fled syria to the united states in 2014 to “escape near certain death” at the hands of sectarian military forces fighting the syrian government in aleppo, according to his lawsuit.  he subsequently obtained asylum for his wife and their only surviving child, a daughter, and their application had cleared the security vetting process and was headed for final processing when it was halted by trump’s original travel ban on jan. 27. that executive order sought to ban admission to the united states of citizens from seven muslim majority countries   iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria, yemen and iraq   for 120 days and to suspend entry of all refugees indefinitely.  the original travel ban, which caused widespread chaos and protests at airports when first implemented, was rescinded after the state of washington won a nationwide federal court order blocking further enforcement of the policy. the modified executive order reduced the number of excluded counties   removing iraq from the list   and lifted the indefinite refugee travel ban for syrians. but opponents from several states have gone to court seeking to halt its implementation as well. “the court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order,” conley wrote in his decision. “as the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.” in a related development on friday, the federal judge in seattle who imposed a nationwide injunction on enforcement of the original travel ban refused a request to apply that order to the revised policy, saying that lawyers from states opposed to the measure needed to file more extensive court papers.

" at least 800 civilians have been killed in strikes in iraq and syria by the u.s. led coalition fighting islamic state since the campaign began in 2014, according to a report released by the coalition on thursday. the estimate in the monthly report, which said coalition strikes had unintentionally killed at least 801 civilians between august 2014 and october 2017, was far lower than figures provided by monitoring groups. the monitoring group airwars says a total of at least 5,961 civilians have been killed by coalition air strikes.  we continue to hold ourselves accountable for actions that may have caused unintentional injury or death to civilians,  the coalition said in its report. since the start of the campaign against islamic state militants, the coalition has carried out more than 28,000 strikes and has received 1,790 reports of potential civilian casualties, the report said. it was still assessing 695 reports of civilian casualties from strikes it carried out in iraq and in syria. the coalition, battling to defeat islamic state militants in iraq and syria, says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.

"this is not the first time putin has warned the us to hurry up with its release of hillary s emails. biden better get the emergency campaign team ready. if putin releases the unedited, corrupt version of hillary s highly classified emails, crooked hillary will not likely be able to overcome the damage that will be done to what s left of her reputation. reliable intelligence sources in the west have indicated that warnings had been received that the russian government could in the near future release the text of email messages intercepted from u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton s private e-mail server from the time she was u.s. secretary of state. the release would, the messaging indicated, prove that secretary clinton had, in fact, laid open u.s. secrets to foreign interception by putting highly-classified government reports onto a private server in violation of u.s. law, and that, as suspected, the server had been targeted and hacked by foreign intelligence services.the reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by russian federation president vladimir putin, and it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as wikileaks. the apparent message from moscow, through the intelligence community, seemed to indicate frustration with the pace of the official u.s. department of justice investigation into the so-called server scandal, which seemed to offer prima facie evidence that u.s. law had been violated by mrs clinton s decision to use a private server through which to conduct official and often highly-secret communications during her time as secretary of state. u.s.sources indicated that the extensive deptartment of justice probe was more focused on the possibility that the private server was used to protect messaging in which secretary clinton allegedly discussed quid pro quo transactions with private donors to the clinton foundation in exchange for influence on u.s. policy.the russian possession of the intercepts, however, was designed also to show that, apart from violating u.s. law in the fundamental handling of classified documents (which sec. clinton had alleged was no worse than the mishandling of a few documents by cia director david petraeus or clinton s national security advisor sandy berger), the traffic included highly-classified materials which had their classification headers stripped. russian (and other) sources had indicated frustration with the pace of the justice dept. probe, and its avoidance of the national security aspects of intelligence handling. this meant that the topic would be suppressed by the u.s. barack obama administration so that it would not be a factor in the current u.s. presidential election campaign, in which president obama had endorsed mrs clinton. via: oilprice.com",1
" president donald trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the u.s. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.     at a roundtable on farm labor at the white house last month, trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           “he assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,” said zippy duvall, president of the american farm bureau federation, one of 14 participants at the april 25 meeting with trump and agriculture secretary sonny perdue. during the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. some farmers told trump they often cannot find americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. they said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the h 2a visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. the white house declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as “very productive.” the u.s. department of agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the april meeting.  about half of u.s. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the u.s. department of labor’s national agriculture workers’ survey.  during the roundtable, luke brubaker, a dairy farmer from pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  the employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, brubaker told the gathering at the white house.  trump said he wanted to help and asked secretary perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. while other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor “than about anything else we talked about,”  said bill northey, a farmer and iowa’s secretary of agriculture. tom demaline, president of willoway nurseries in ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the h 2a guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. he told trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. “i brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “if the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. you are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.” while use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. in 2016, the government granted 134,000 h 2a visas employers who import workers with h 2a visas must provide free transportation to and from the united states as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  steve scaroni, whose company fresh harvest brings in thousands of foreign h 2a workers for growers in california’s central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.  for a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs/2qdtfnb trump recently signed another executive order titled “buy american, hire american,” calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including trump’s own resorts. trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the united states illegally and speeding up deportations. roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. “he has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,” said meeting attendee steve troxler, north carolina’s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. the farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short term and permanent workers. they said there should be a program to help long time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  last tuesday, democrats in the house and senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a “blue card” to protect them from deportation.  brubaker, the pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president’s support to make it a bipartisan effort.  “the administration has got something started here,” he said of the meeting with farm leaders. “it’s about time something happens.”   ",0
" long delayed legislation to impose new sanctions on russia hit another snag on monday when the influential republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said the announcement of a deal to move the bill forward was premature. “we still have a little work to do,” senator bob corker told reporters at the u.s. senate. he said he expected differences could be resolved quickly but declined to give a specific timeframe. republicans and democrats in the house of representatives and senate democrats had announced on saturday that they had reached an agreement that would allow a vote on the sanctions bill in the house on tuesday. house aides said the bill is expected to pass overwhelmingly. but corker said the announcement of a deal “seemed somewhat premature.” “it’s not quite done, but it feels like it’s moving to a good place,” corker said. he said issues included north korea sanctions that were added to a bill including sanctions on iran and russia that passed the senate overwhelmingly in june. he said senate and house staff members were still discussing the measure. “it’s very, very close,” he said. an earlier version of the bill, including sanctions on russia and iran, passed the senate 98 2 on june 15. but it never came up for a vote in the house, after president donald trump’s administration objected to provisions including a requirement that he obtain congress’ approval before easing any sanctions on moscow. trump’s relationship with russia has been a focus of the first six months of his presidency after he called for warmer relations with moscow while campaigning and amid an investigation of whether his associates colluded with russian hackers to influence the election on his behalf. the new sanctions bill is the latest in a series of efforts by members of congress to prevent trump from easing sanctions on moscow. the new version of the measure announced on saturday added sanctions on north korea but left intact most provisions of the bill passed by the senate, including the congressional review provision. corker said he had been in touch with the administration since saturday but declined to elaborate beyond saying he thought officials had come to a “fuller understanding” of the measure. on monday, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump would examine whether the bill was offering the “best deal” for the american people and then decide whether he would support it.

" the cost to healthcare companies for u.s. regulatory review of their products, including drugs and medical devices, would more than double under the trump administration’s proposed 2018 budget. for 2018, the trump administration has budgeted over $2 billion in fees to be collected by the u.s. food and drug administration from industry, twice as much as in 2017, according to budget documents released on thursday. citing a constrained budget environment, the proposed budget said industries that benefit from the fda’s approval “can and should pay for their share.” in return, the budget said it also offered measures that would help speed up the approval process for new drugs and other products. the fda has been criticized by lawmakers for not being quick enough at approving drugs, and president donald trump told congress earlier this year that he aimed to speed up the approval of drugs.  the fda has been charging companies to review their products since 1992. most of the user fees collected are for prescription drugs   around $866 million estimated in 2017   and generic drugs   around $324 million, according to the fda website. the fda’s 2017 budget was $5.1 billion, the website said. the budget does not say if the fee increases would be evenly spread or directed in a particular area. the budget did not provide specifics on what measures to speed up approvals might include.

" the union backed “fight for $15” movement protested at carl’s jr and hardee’s restaurants on thursday in a bid to stop the chains’ head, a vocal opponent of minimum wage increases and “overregulation,” from becoming u.s. labor secretary. senate leadership has pushed back the confirmation hearing of andrew puzder to february from a tentative date of jan. 17.  puzder, 66, leads cke restaurants inc. for years, he has said obama administration policies have saddled industry with higher costs and contributed to a “government mandated restaurant recession.”        an enthusiastic supporter of president elect donald trump, puzder has spoken against efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 and is widely expected to roll back policies such as those aimed at curbing unpaid overtime and improving worker safety. the four year old “fight for $15” movement has helped win big minimum wage hikes in california and new york. it also seeks to unionize restaurant workers. the restaurant industry is the biggest u.s. employer of minimum wage workers, and cke’s restaurants, like many others, have been cited or sued for violating wage and safety rules. “if puzder is confirmed as labor secretary, it will mean the trump years will be about low pay ... instead of making lives better for working americans like me,” said terrance dixon, 32, who makes $9 per hour at a st. louis hardee’s.       puzder was unavailable for comment. he recently resigned from the international franchise association’s board. that industry group represents companies like cke and mcdonald’s corp and has urged its 15,000 members to lobby on puzder’s behalf.     “these protests distract from the real issues at hand for our nation’s leaders – how to create economic growth at all levels, which is the only real solution to income inequality in america,” said matt haller, ifa’s senior vice president of public affairs.       senate democrats including elizabeth warren of massachusetts held a hearing on tuesday after republican rivals rebuffed their request to bring witnesses to puzder’s upcoming confirmation hearing.  the protestor packed event included testimony from laura mcdonald, 51, who was a general manager at a cke owned carl’s jr restaurant in california from 1988 until 2012.  she has joined two potential california class action wage and hour lawsuits against cke, which during her tenure switched general managers from salaried to hourly workers. in 2004, cke paid $9 million to settle california lawsuits claiming unpaid overtime for general managers. “when cke made general managers into hourly employees, it set our wages so low that we had to work 47 1/2 hours a week just to earn the same money we’ve been being paid as a salary,” mcdonald said.  a transition official accused democrats of running a smear campaign and lauded puzder as a successful businessman. puzder opponents face stiff odds when it comes to derailing his confirmation by the republican controlled senate. the last six incoming presidents made 109 cabinet level appointments and just six picks did not go on to win senate approval, according to an analysis by the website fivethirtyeight.

" republican chris christie considered the future of his struggling u.s. presidential bid on wednesday amid news reports he would suspend his campaign and narrow the field of rivals facing businessman donald trump. a disappointing sixth place finish in tuesday’s new hampshire nominating contest raised doubts about the combative new jersey governor’s viability as a candidate for the nov. 8 presidential election. the wall street journal quoted a senior adviser to the campaign as saying christie was expected to make an announcement soon suspending his campaign. other news organizations carried similar reports. a spokeswoman for christie’s campaign said no decision had been made about whether he would stay in the race. christie’s departure would leave eight republicans from a field that once had 17 candidates vying to represent the party. trump has dominated the republican race and won the party primary in new hampshire on a wave of voter anger at traditional u.s. politicians. u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, a democratic socialist, defeated former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton in the state’s democratic contest.      the results testified to the sizable share of american voters upset over the slow economic recovery, immigration and america’s place in the world and willing to send a shockwave to washington.  on wednesday, republican national committee chairman reince priebus said he understood the frustration and expected republican voters to coalesce behind a candidate. “i think it’s pretty normal and i think it’s pretty common and expect that sort of vein is going to play itself out for the next few months and you know we’ll have a unified party when it’s done,” he told cnn in an interview. christie had poured much of his campaign’s resources into new hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. he canceled plans to go to south carolina, a sign he could drop out soon. the southern state holds the next republican primary on feb. 20. “no decision has been made,” christie spokeswoman sam smith wrote in an email to reuters.          trump’s opponents, most of them mainstream republicans, could benefit if christie pulls out. ohio’s republican governor, john kasich, finished second in new hampshire, followed by u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, former florida governor jeb bush and u.s. senator marco rubio of florida. for trump, new hampshire showed he has staying power and can take a punch after losing last week to u.s. senator ted cruz of texas in the first nominating contest, the iowa caucuses. the former reality tv star’s win showed pundits were wrong to think he would quickly self destruct based on his penchant for insults and imprecise plans for the presidency.    trump’s odds for winning the white house, once seen as an extremely long shot, improved significantly after his victory in new hampshire, online betting site ladbrokes plc lad.l said. the real estate tycoon is now at 9/2, compared to 7/1 last week, meaning that his chances of victory in november are now 18 percent. clinton still had the best odds of becoming president at 50/50, ladbrokes said.  on the democratic side, sanders courted the african american vote on wednesday, having breakfast with civil rights leader rev. al sharpton at a restaurant in new york city’s harlem neighborhood. clinton currently has strong support from african american voters, who will be crucial in the democratic primary in south carolina on feb. 27.  sharpton and barack obama met at the same restaurant during obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign   a piece of symbolism for sanders as he tries to expand his appeal beyond  liberals in the u.s. northeast. november’s election is followed by the inauguration of obama’s successor in early 2017. “my concern is that in january of next year for the first time in american history a black family will be moving out of the white house,” sharpton, a baptist minister and television talk show host, told reporters afterward. “i do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. we must be front and center and not marginalized. and senator sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored.” sharpton discussed a spate of police shootings of black males and other issues with the senator. sharpton said he would not endorse a candidate until he met with clinton. clinton consistently polls better among african american voters and has a long history of support for civil rights. she also has benefited from husband bill clinton’s popularity in the black community during his presidency, although that became strained during her fierce 2008 primary battle with obama.     even before the exit polls on tuesday showed sanders had won new hampshire, clinton’s campaign was trying to highlight her double digit lead over sanders among african american and latino voters. “it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters,” clinton campaign manager robby mook said in a memo to reporters. he predicted the democratic race would be won in march, when the nominating contests quickly expand to 22 delegate rich states with some of the largest minority and urban populations, and that clinton would have the advantage.

" two staff members of a kenyan university were killed south of mombasa on tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.  the identity of the gunmen was unclear. police in the coastal county of kwale, where the technical university of mombasa (tum) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants. security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. somali islamist militants al shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there. in 2015, al shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in kenya s garissa town near the kenya somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in kenya and abroad.  two staff members of the university were killed tuesday s attack, and a driver and two policemen were wounded, area police chief joseph chebusit told reuters.   a bus carrying students of tum was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,  the policeman said.   armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. as a result two ladies who are staff of tum were killed in the van. the driver of the van and two police officers were injured,  he said.    we have information that the attackers had other accomplices along the road who were monitoring the movement of the two vehicles and communicating with them to enable the attack,  he added.   for now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al shabaab.  a witness who did not want to be named told reuters she and several other students had fled their vehicle when gunmen opened fire on them and had seen several students covered in blood.  but chebusit said no students were injured.

" donald trump gained on hillary clinton among american voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half despite a string of women accusing him of unwanted sexual advances and the furor over his disputed claims that the election process is rigged, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on friday. the survey also showed that 63 percent of americans, including a third of republicans, believe the new york real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past, though the republican presidential candidate has denied the recent accusations. clinton, the democratic former secretary of state, led trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the oct. 14 20 poll, a 4 point lead, with the nov. 8 election fast approaching. that compared with 44 percent for clinton and 37 percent for trump in the oct. 7 13 poll released last week. clinton’s lead also shrank in a separate four way poll that included alternative party candidates: 43 percent supported her, while 39 percent supported trump, 6 percent supported libertarian candidate gary johnson, and 2 percent supported jill stein of the green party. support for clinton had been mostly rising in the seven day tracking poll since the last week of august, when the candidates were about tied. the latest reading showed that trump’s deficit narrowed to what it was before a video surfaced on oct. 7 featuring him bragging about groping and kissing women. several women have since accused him of making unwanted sexual advances in separate incidents from the early 1980s to 2007. trump has denied the allegations, calling them “totally and absolutely false.” the latest poll included a separate series of questions that asked people what they thought of trump’s conduct around women. it found 63 percent of american adults, including 34 percent of likely republican voters, agreed with the statement “i believe donald trump has committed sexual assault in the past.”  reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that trump had “committed sexual assault” but were still supporting his candidacy. their answers were generally the same: whatever trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. “i’m embarrassed that our country can’t come up with better candidates, to be honest with you,” said evelyn brendemuhl, 83, of hope, north dakota. but “he’ll appoint more conservative judges, and she’s (clinton) pro abortion, and i’m not for that.” gary taylor, 59, a republican from colorado said his support stemmed mostly from a desire to see “something different than the last eight years” in the white house. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english in all 50 states. it included 1,640 people who were considered likely voters, given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. it has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. the poll questions on trump’s unwanted sexual advances scandal were asked of 1,915 american adults, including 546 likely republican voters. it had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points for all adults and 5 points for republican voters.

" the two parties that are in talks to join german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives in government inched closer together in one of the most bitterly contested policy areas on monday, brightening prospects for a coalition. merkel opened what promise to be marathon coalition talks on friday, hoping to bring three opposing political camps into a stable government despite signs there would be less money to paper over differences. further talks to discuss tax, finances and europe are planned for tuesday. merkel said she was hoping to complete exploratory talks   an initial stage during which parties decide whether to go ahead with full blown coalition negotiations   by nov. 17 or 18, participants in a meeting of her conservative bloc said. at that point the conservative sister parties, the liberal free democrats (fdp) and the greens should have a document that lays out the rough outlines of what a coalition would work on, the participants cited merkel as saying. cem ozdemir, leader of the environmentalist greens, welcomed a proposal by the fdp for global action to make it harder for large technology companies to book their taxes in more favorable jurisdictions.  i m pleased that fdp leader christian lindner has moved on this, saying that internet companies for example should be more strongly and fairly taxed,  said ozdemir, highlighting progress made in an area where the two parties had been far apart.  it cannot be right that amazon and apple use europe as a location and use its infrastructure, but refuse to contribute appropriately to its financing even as every bookseller is chased down if he doesn t pay tax on time,  he added. lindner, whose party advocates low tax and fiscal discipline, also called for deeper cooperation within the european union and the group of 20 leading economies to make global firms pay more tax. the ability of international companies to minimize their tax liabilities by booking profits in lower tax jurisdictions has come under the spotlight in recent years as cash strapped states struggle to finance expanding social and security liabilities.  i can imagine tax increases for companies like apple,  lindner told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper, in an apparent sacrifice of one of his party s shibboleths to smooth the path towards an unprecedentedly tricky three way coalition. merkel s conservatives suffered punishing losses in this month s national election, forcing them to patch together a heterogeneous three way coalition with few precedents in germany s post war history.  the potential three way pact has been dubbed a  jamaica  coalition because the three parties  colors   black, yellow and green   match those of the jamaican flag. the greens want to boost infrastructure and environment spending, but the fdp and fiscal hawks in the conservative camp view spending proposals with concern. the talks, which continue tomorrow, are set to drag on until at least the end of the year.  merkel s christian democrat party estimates that the smaller parties  tax and spending proposals would cost as much as 100 billion euros ($117.37 billion) over the next four years, three times what its expert reckon is available.   senior conservative volker kauder said if the three way alliance agreed to govern together it would stick to the  black zero    or balanced budget   that was a hallmark of outgoing finance minister wolfgang schaeuble s tenure.  you can assume that we will of course make the balanced budget an object of coalition negotiations if they happen,  he said ahead of a meeting of the conservatives in parliament.  and in the exploratory talks it was not disputed at all: there will be no new debt. we ll stick to the black zero.  german newspaper handelsblatt cited an internal finance ministry paper as saying the new government should  preferably  use the roughly 30 billion euros of leeway for tax cuts, infrastructure investment   especially expanding the broadband network   and tackling the causes of migration. it said all further measures should completely come out of the budgets of the sector they relate to and should be financed either by higher revenues or cuts in other areas. the finance ministry was not immediately available to comment on the report.         transport minister alexander dobrindt, a conservative, told bild newspaper that immigration limits, social benefits and the future of europe remained big areas of conflict. lindner maintained the hard line on greece that his party is known for, saying that any country that took a debt haircut would need to leave the euro zone.

" russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin said on wednesday the failed launch of a 2.6 billion rouble ($44.95 million) satellite last month was due to an embarrassing programming error. russian space agency roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly launched weather satellite   the meteor m   after it blasted off from russia s new vostochny cosmodrome in the far east. eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from russia, norway, sweden, the united states, japan, canada and germany, were on board the same rocket. speaking to rossiya 24 state tv channel, rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error.  the rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates, he said, saying it had been given bearings for take off from a different cosmodrome   baikonur   which moscow leases from kazakhstan.  the rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from baikonur,  said rogozin.  they didn t get the coordinates right.  the vostochny spaceport, laid out in the thick taiga forest of the amur region, is the first civilian rocket launch site in russia. in april last year, after delays and massive costs overruns, russia launched its first rocket from vostochny, a day after a technical glitch forced an embarrassing postponement of the event in the presence of president vladimir putin.

" president donald trump said in remarks broadcast on sunday that he would put vice president mike pence in charge of a commission to probe what he believes was voter fraud in last november’s election.		 there is an overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts, and politicians that voter fraud is rare in the united states, but trump has repeatedly said he thinks perhaps millions of votes cast in the nov. 8 election were fraudulent. “i’m going to set up a commission to be headed by vice president pence and we’re going to look at it very, very carefully,” trump told fox news channel’s bill o’reilly in an interview taped on friday. trump, who was spending the weekend at his mar a lago resort in palm beach, florida, captured the presidency by winning enough of the state by state electoral college votes to defeat democrat hillary clinton. still, clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, piling up an overwhelming majority in deeply democratic states like california. this has irked trump and as a result he has claimed voter fraud without evidence. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a kentucky republican, said on cnn’s “state of the union” that election fraud does occur but that “there is no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election.” “and i don’t think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that. i think the states can take a look at this issue,” he said.

" the u.s. senate budget committee on thursday voted to confirm republican congressman mick mulvaney as white house budget director under president donald trump. senators narrowly approved trump’s nominee along party lines in a 12 11 vote. democrats criticized him for hard line fiscal positions on popular social programs and for failing to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in relation to a household employee until after he was nominated. his nomination will now move to the senate floor for a full confirmation vote.  mulvaney, a south carolina republican and a leading member of the conservative house freedom caucus, favors raising the social security retirement age to 70 and means testing beneficiaries of the medicare healthcare program. budget committee chairman mike enzi, a wyoming republican, told the panel mulvaney is “uniquely qualified” to be budget director: “he is a proven budget hawk that’s been vocal about our need to rein in government spending and debt.”      but the nominee came under fire from senator bernie sanders, an independent who ran for the democratic presidential nomination last year.  the vermont lawmaker warned that mulvaney’s positions on social security and medicare contradict trump’s campaign statements to leave the programs untouched. sanders also said his failure to pay taxes for a nanny he employed from 2000 to 2004 should disqualify him as a nominee.   sanders and fellow independent angus king of maine voted with the committee’s nine democrats to oppose mulvaney.

" donald trump was right. countless others were wrong. the pundits and pollsters who said the former reality tv star could not win the u.s. presidency, the republicans who shunned him, the business leaders who denounced him and the democrats who dismissed him failed to fully understand the depth of his support.  in a stunning victory over democrat hillary clinton, trump stuck to a plan that worked to perfection in the republican primary, a campaign built around his blunt talking celebrity persona, his command of social media, and his anti establishment message of change. “ours was not a campaign, but an incredible and great movement,” trump said in his victory speech on wednesday.  it was a movement driven by discontent. the reuters/ipsos election day poll found that most americans who came to the polls were clearly angry with the direction of the country. six out of 10 people said they felt the country is on the wrong track. some 58 percent said “more and more i don’t identify with what america has become” and 75 percent said “america needs a strong leader to take the country back” from the wealthy. those who felt the country was on the wrong track were three times as likely to vote for trump as clinton.  in a bitter and divisive campaign, trump cleared a series of obstacles that would doom any other candidate: an audio tape in which he talked of groping women; a refusal to release his tax returns; violence at his rallies; his mockery of a disabled  reporter; and his attacks on the heritage of a federal judge and the muslim family of a u.s. soldier.  “he was an imperfect candidate with a near perfect message,” said ford o’connell, a republican strategist who has long backed trump. “i don’t think a lot of people understood that.” in a year when voters in the united states and abroad showed their antipathy toward the political establishment, the globalized economy, and corporate welfare, trump guessed correctly he could ride that wave of discontent to the white house.  he exploited a growing divide in the country between whites and minorities, urbanites and rural residents, the college educated and the working class. trump beat clinton among white men without a college degree by 31 points and white women without a degree by 27 points, according to the reuters/ipsos polling.  he also benefited from an opponent with her own flaws. clinton was continually dragged down by questions over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and the activities of her family foundation, while her corporate friendly background left some democrats skeptical and unenthusiastic. that appeared to cost her support among women, young voters and minorities – three groups that are critical for democrats to win big. clinton won each of these groups, but by smaller margins than president barack obama held when he defeated republican candidate mitt romney in 2012. some 49 percent of women supported clinton, the first woman nominee of a major party, while 47 percent supported trump.  among women between the ages of 18 and 34, about 55 percent supported clinton, while 38 percent supported trump. in 2012, 62 percent of young women supported obama, while 36 percent supported romney. white voters, especially men in rural areas, flocked to trump in record numbers. trump appealed to voters unhappy with the hollowing out of the country’s manufacturing sector and fearful of the country’s changing demographics, campaigning on a harsh anti immigration message.   trump won 56 percent of the white vote, while clinton won just 39 percent. he dominated to an even greater degree in rural areas, where he beat clinton by 27 points. trump promised big things: that he would bring jobs back and punish outsourcing corporations, that he would restore the country to some unspecified early time of prosperity and security   even as unemployment tumbled below 5 percent. specifics were never trump’s strength. instead, he used an “us versus them” message to build voter enthusiasm in places where most republican candidates never ventured, rural areas with voters who felt ignored by washington. matt borges, the chairman of the ohio republican party, said trump, unlike romney, made voters feel like they mattered. before trump, he said, “we weren’t listening to what voters actually care about.” trump thumbed his nose at the extensive get out the vote operation and data rich organization that are seen as essential to a modern winning campaign.  his campaign relied instead on more unofficial networks of rabid supporters to get the word out. his advisers argued that he would bring scores of neglected white voters back into the political process, including blue collar democrats in places such as pennsylvania. until trump, republicans had not won pennsylvania since 1988. craig robinson, a veteran of iowa republican politics, said pundits underestimated how trump’s strength in the primaries would carry over to the general election.  “in an election where the conventional wisdom was proven wrong time and time again, they convinced themselves that conventional wisdom would prevail in the general election,” robinson said. “the voters saw through it.”  ",0
" president donald trump on thursday named andrew wheeler, a coal industry lobbyist and former congressional staffer, as his pick for deputy administrator of the u.s. environmental protection agency, prompting contrasting reactions from industry and environmental groups. the sierra club, an environmental group, called his nomination, which is subject to senate confirmation,  “absolutely horrifying,” while a coal industry group and some republican politicians said he was well qualified for the job. the epa said in a statement wheeler had spent four years at the agency’s office of pollution prevention and toxics during the george h. w. bush and clinton administrations, as well as many years on capitol hill, including as counsel for conservative republican senator james inhofe. it said he currently works as a principal at faegrebd consulting, “providing guidance on federal regulatory and legislative environmental and energy issues.”   inhofe said in the statement that no one is more qualified than wheeler to help epa administrator scott pruitt “restore epa to its proper size and scope.” the american coalition for clean coal electricity, an industry lobby group, called wheeler extraordinarily qualified for the job, saying in a statement: “his understanding of a wide range of environmental policies and the policy development process — combined with his thoughtfulness, judgment and temperament — will enable him to be an outstanding deputy administrator.” but the sierra club called his nomination “absolutely horrifying,” adding in a statement: “andrew wheeler is a big time lobbyist who has represented big coal for almost a decade, including in numerous lawsuits challenging the epa. he is a friend to polluters, not to american families that rely on clean air and clean water.”  pruitt led 14 lawsuits against the agency when he was oklahoma’s attorney general, and has said he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change, a position widely embraced by scientists. he was appointed by president donald trump, a climate change doubter, who campaigned on a pledge to boost the u.s. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by reducing regulation.  he also promised to pull washington out of a global pact to fight climate change, which he did in june.

" after fleeing homes in hurricane irma s path several days ago, florida residents lee tinkler and mercedes lopez on tuesday faced far different prospects as they departed from the orlando hotels where they sought refuge. tinkler, a retiree from jupiter, florida, said she was about to end  the best experience of my life  after waiting out the storm at a high end convention hotel with her two daughters, their two babies and seven cats.  but at a nearby days inn, lopez s spirits were low as she shared a bucket of fried chicken with four families from the florida keys bunking together in two cramped rooms. they were returning to salvage belongings from destroyed homes.  i don t have a house, i don t have a job,  said lopez, 50, who works for a gas station that was also devastated.  we go back to nothing.  they are part of a complicated return home after the largest evacuation in u.s. history which saw 6.5 million people flee the storm in florida.   after surviving what began as one of the fiercest atlantic storms in a century, many are returning with conflicting emotions. the relief of going home is at times overwhelmed by the logistics of the trip and then putting their pre storm lives back together. on social media, travelers traded advice on how to avoid the chaotic scenes many experienced on the way out: long lines for gasoline and traffic so bad that people slept in their cars. hoping to avoid such congestion, cathy bobal, a 59 year old retiree from coconut creek, florida, decided on tuesday to spend a fifth night in orlando before leaving at 3 a.m.  as she arranged her check out from the rosen center, which reduced rates and waived pet and parking fees for evacuees, others were checking in.  it s round two,  she said.  people are coming in because they don t have power.  tinkler, 73, left with plans to return the next time a hurricane menaced her home.  i want to live in this world forever,  she said, envisioning disaster reunions with the other guests.  we had a party.   across town, the group from marathon, florida, was ending five nights at days inn not knowing whether authorities would even allow them back into their homes.  it s a total disaster. our house was destroyed. i ve seen the pictures,  said heidi hernandez, 23, a school teacher.  we re going down there to salvage what we can and then come back up.

" u.s. president donald trump said on tuesday he has “great heart” for illegal immigrants brought to the united states as children and he wants congress to produce a legislative solution for them. “i have a great heart for the folks we’re talking about, a great love for them,” trump said after his administration announced earlier tuesday it was phasing out a program that protects the so called dreamers from deportation. “i can tell you in speaking to members of congress they want to be able to do something and do it right and really we have no choice,” trump told reporters.

" the united nations security council will meet at 3 p.m. edt (1900 gmt) on friday on the latest north korea missile test, diplomats said, at the request of the united states and japan.  north korea fired a missile that flew over japan s northern hokkaido far out into the pacific ocean on friday, south korean and japanese officials said, further ratcheting up tensions after pyongyang s recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb. the 15 member security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea on monday over its sept. 3 nuclear test, imposing a ban on the country s textile exports and capping imports of crude oil. it was the ninth u.n. sanctions resolution adopted on north korea since 2006.

" facing potentially deep budget cuts to u.s. foreign aid, new usaid administrator mark green says he needs to do more with less and prove to president donald trump that development assistance can further his “america first” agenda.  in a first meeting with trump back in january, green made his pitch to the then president elect, drawing from his experience in central america to explain how u.s. funded programs there could help slow the number of immigrants trying to enter the united states illegally. “i said ‘mr. president elect, i believe our development tools can help us achieve just about every one of your strategic priorities,’” green told reuters in his first interview since starting last week as head of the u.s. agency for international development. green had previously worked on u.s supported projects with indigenous mayors in guatemala, honduras and el salvador to improve living conditions “so kids hopefully don’t go 1,000 miles through the worst conditions imaginable and jump the border.” “it works and is a great way to use development,” he said, sitting in a still bare office at usaid headquarters blocks from the white house. green brings a unique resume to the job: a former four term republican congressman from wisconsin who served as u.s. ambassador to tanzania under president george w. bush. in his last job as head of the international republican institute, he helped promote governance and democracy overseas. his time on capitol hill will be key to his new job. in a sign of his good standing there, green’s nomination had support across the political spectrum, as well as among aid groups.   trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of u.s. tax dollars. and now his administration has proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third, which could gut programs across a range of issues including health, governance, gender and education. but u.s. foreign assistance has traditionally garnered bipartisan support in congress, which controls the aid purse strings. green has stronger relations with lawmakers than his  predecessors, who battled congress on funding and objectives. “what’s very different for mark green is that his strongest allies are on the hill,” said scott morris, a senior fellow at the center for global development in washington. “where he faces headwinds are with both the white house and the state department.”  “there is a real potential for conflicts in basic philosophy about what usaid does,” added morris. green is nevertheless sanguine about prospects for a downsized, budget constrained usaid.  “we can’t do everything,” he said. “the resources are limited, so we have to prioritize.” green takes over an agency that has already been through waves of reform in the last decade, adapting to shifting global development patterns featuring deep pocket philanthropic groups, more private sector investment in emerging economies, and the rise of china as a financier in the developing world. new demands have emerged with an unprecedented refugee crisis from wars in syria and iraq, along with famine in africa, and growing violent extremism. “usaid’s humanitarian work is unrivaled, it is mobilization of american generosity, and it will continue,” green said, adding that u.s. assistance should both help in times of crisis and prevent crises from occurring. he wants u.s. foreign assistance to focus on results to show americans that their tax dollars are being put to good use. “i am going to ask every program to show me how it is moving us closer to the day when people can lead themselves,” said green. “if it is not helping, they’re going to have to tell me why.” ",0

" the syrian democratic forces (sdf), an alliance of kurdish and arab militias, said on friday it had taken the last districts in the old city of raqqa from islamic state, but the u.s. led coalition which backs it could not confirm the report.  we declare to our people the liberation of the old city of raqqa,  the sdf said in a statement.  the sdf has been battling to capture the former de facto capital of islamic state s self declared caliphate since june with backing from u.s. led jets and special forces.  the walled old city lies in the heart of raqqa but the jihadist group still holds important districts in the west of the city. the sdf said it now held 65 percent of raqqa in total. a war monitor, the britain based syrian observatory for human rights, said it was not true that the sdf had fully captured the old city, but added that it did hold more than 90 percent of that area.  the coalition said it was not yet able to confirm the news.  we have not received confirmation of that through our channels,  coalition spokesman colonel ryan dillon said.

" when lawyers for donald trump asked a court to throw out one of the proposed class actions over trump university, they backed it up with a financial disclosure meant to bolster the republican presidential candidate’s credentials as a global businessman. but the form they filed with the court was actually that of the man trump hopes to succeed in the white house, democratic president barack obama. the president’s nine page disclosure filed before his 2012 re election was erroneously included as an exhibit to a motion trump filed in april asking u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel for the southern district of california to toss the case before trial, according to a person familiar with the case. a corrected exhibit was filed on tuesday.  plaintiffs’ lawyer jason forge seized on the goof in a court document filed late on friday opposing trump’s motion. forge said the candidate’s filing was meant for a court in “bizarro world.”  “this is just one example of trump’s statement’s complete lack of credibility,” forge said. julie fei, a spokeswoman for o’melveny & myers, the firm that has been representing trump in the case, declined to comment. in court filings, trump’s lawyers said the form supported the “undisputed fact” that trump is chairman, president and chief executive of the trump organization, which conducts business around the world and is affiliated with over 500 companies. instead, it showed obama’s royalties from his memoir “dreams from my father” and disclosed the first family’s 2011 assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million. trump is facing two lawsuits in california and one in new york over trump university that allege the series of real estate seminars taught students nothing and defrauded them of as much as $35,000 each in fees. the presumptive republican nominee for the nov. 8 election has raised the litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated, and accusing the indiana born curiel of being biased against him because of his mexican ancestry.  trump’s lawyers intended to file the 92 page financial disclosure form he made public last summer at the time he announced he was running for president. that lists some $1.4 billion in assets, including real estate and other holdings, and $265 million in liabilities. the disclosure does not note his net worth, which he has said is over $10 billion.

" u.s. lawmakers reached an agreement on wednesday paving the way for the u.s. senate to pass a bill as soon as this week to impose new sanctions on russia and bar president donald trump from easing sanctions on moscow without congress’ approval. earlier on wednesday, russia warned it was edging closer to retaliation against washington after the house of representatives backed new u.s. sanctions on moscow, while the european union said the move  might affect its energy security and it stood ready to act too. “i am glad to announce that we have reached an agreement that will allow us to send sanctions legislation to the president’s desk,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee, said in a statement on wednesday evening. he said the senate would move to approve sanctions on russia and iran that it originally passed in mid june, as well as sanctions on north korea developed by the house of representatives and included in a bill the house passed overwhelmingly on wednesday. before the latest agreement, some senators had objected to the north korea measures and it had looked like the sanctions bill, already delayed since mid june, could languish into september. if the bill passes the senate as expected, it would be sent to the white house for trump to sign into law or veto. it is, however, expected to garner enough support to override a trump veto. the house voted 419 3 on tuesday to impose new sanctions on moscow and force trump to obtain lawmakers’ approval before easing any punitive measures on russia. “this is rather sad news from the point of view of russia u.s. ties,” said dmitry peskov, a kremlin spokesman. “we are talking about an extremely unfriendly act.” he said president vladimir putin would decide if and how moscow would retaliate once the sanctions became law. russia’s deputy foreign minister warned the move was taking bilateral relations into uncharted waters, killing off hopes of improving them in the near future. trump, whose presidency has been embroiled in a distracting dispute over his associates’ alleged ties to moscow, is on the defensive over accusations russia helped elect him last year. he has said he wants to mend relations with russia that are languishing at a post cold war low. trump had denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and russia. most white house watchers believe trump will reluctantly sign off on the new sanctions, given deep support for them among u.s. lawmakers and his desire to avoid being accused of being soft on moscow. representative ed royce, the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, said trump would have little choice. the senate passed a version of the legislation, without the north korea sanctions, on june 15 by 98 2.  “i think the president will sign it,” royce said on nbc’s meet the press daily on wednesday. the issue has rattled russia, which fears that its economy, weakened by 2014 western sanctions imposed over its role in the ukraine crisis, will now find it harder to recover and grow. foreign investors could be scared off. the european union frets that new u.s. restrictions could pose obstacles to its companies doing business with russia and threaten the bloc’s energy supply lines. the kremlin’s alleged interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election is one reason lawmakers have pushed for the new sanctions. peskov said moscow would wait until the sanctions became law before fully analyzing them and deciding how to respond.   moscow had hoped that trump, who made upbeat statements about putin before winning the white house, would work to repair the u.s. russia relationship. but it has watched with frustration as the vote meddling allegations killed off hopes of any detente. the russian foreign ministry said this month that too many american spies were operating in russia under diplomatic cover and it might expel some to retaliate for the expulsion of 35 russian diplomats last year by then president barack obama’s administration. many russian politicians increasingly believe trump’s political foes and congress have left the u.s. president with little room for maneuver on russia and they have nothing to lose by retaliating. in brussels, european commission president jean claude juncker said the eu was ready to act “within a matter of days” if it felt the new u.s. sanctions undermined the bloc’s energy security. brussels fears the new sanctions will damage european firms and oil and gas projects on which the eu is dependent. the russia section of the bill includes sanctions on a range of industries. several provisions target russian energy, with new limits on u.s. investment in russian companies. u.s. firms also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where russian firms have a stake of 33 percent or higher. the bill includes sanctions on foreign firms investing in or helping russian energy exploration, although the president could waive those sanctions. the bill would give the trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on firms helping develop russian export pipelines, such as the nord stream 2 pipeline carrying natural gas to europe, in which german companies are involved. in a concession to allies, those sanctions are optional, not mandatory. the european commission said a number of eu concerns had been taken into account in the most recent version of the bill, but said it could lead to sanctions on any company, including european, that worked on russian energy export pipelines.

" china’s foreign ministry on wednesday said that china fully and strictly implements u.n. security council resolutions on north korea and will investigate if there are activities that contravene resolutions. china upholds resolving the north korean nuclear issue via talks, ministry spokeswomen hua chunying added, speaking at a regular news briefing in beijing.  u.s. president donald trump will ask china to cut its financial links with north korea and to abide by u.n. sanctions when meeting with chinese president xi jinping in beijing, a senior white house official said on wednesday. trump arrived in beijing on wednesday afternoon from south korea for a two night stop in the chinese capital as part of his marathon asia tour.

" the afghan taliban said on monday that kevin king, one of two professors from the american university of afghanistan who were kidnapped in kabul last year, is seriously ill and needs urgent medical attention.  taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid said king, an american, was suffering from  dangerous  heart disease and kidney problems.  his illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,  mujahid said in a statement.   we have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,  he said. the u.s. state department called for the immediate and unconditional release of king and other hostages. king and his australian colleague timothy weeks were kidnapped in august 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the afghan capital. afghan and western officials believe the men are being held by the haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. they acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern afghanistan months after the two were taken.  the taliban statement came around two weeks after pakistani troops rescued canadian joshua boyle and his american wife caitlan coleman from an area near the afghan border. they had been held by the haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.  earlier this year, the taliban released a video of king and weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom. kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the taliban and other militant groups in afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members.

" the new, more narrowly tailored temporary travel ban president donald trump signed on monday will be more difficult to challenge successfully in court, legal experts said. they said that since his order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers, challengers are likely to have a harder time finding people in the united states who can legally claim they have been harmed, and thus have so called “standing” to sue.  trump’s first executive order signed on jan. 27 banned travelers from seven muslim majority nations   iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen   for 90 days and halted refugee admission for four months, barring syrian refugees indefinitely. its hasty implementation caused chaos and protests at airports. the order was hit with more than two dozen lawsuits, many that claimed it discriminated against muslims. the new ban, which goes into effect on march 16, removes iraq and adds categories of people who would be exempt from the order. the trump administration said the executive order is necessary for national security reasons. it also lists groups of people that could be eligible for waivers, including travelers who have previously been admitted to the united states for work or school, those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry; infants, young children and adoptees or people in need of medical care, employees of the u.s. government and international organizations among others.      all the exceptions make the new order “a lot harder to attack,” said andrew greenfield, an immigration attorney with fragomen law firm in washington d.c.  trump had promised to make the new directive harder to fight in court and many of the changes were expected. “they dotted their ‘i’s’ and crossed their ‘t’s’ in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,” said stephen yale loehr, a cornell law school professor who specializes in immigration. he said opponents might still be able to find plaintiffs   a u.s. citizen could potentially sue if the government denies a waiver to their foreign spouse for an arbitrary reason, for example. in a legal challenge to the original order, the state of washington was successful in preventing it from being carried out. a federal judge in seattle and then an appeals court in san francisco ruled that washington could claim standing, in part because the order adversely affected legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, in the state. more than 100 businesses, including many of the best known tech companies, filed briefs in court that argued their employees were harmed. bob ferguson, the attorney general for washington state said on monday that he will likely decide on the next litigation steps this week after consulting with state universities and businesses about potential harms. “we need to do our homework and be thoughtful about this,” ferguson said. the u.s. department of justice, in a filing in seattle federal court on monday, said the new order applies “only to those who are overseas and without a visa.”  foreign nationals outside the country who do not have a u.s. visa do not have the same protections under the u.s. constitution as people already here, legal experts said.  rosemary jenks, the director of government relations at numbersusa, a conservative group that favors less immigration overall, said that the new order would leave the state of washington having to argue on behalf of unidentified foreign nationals who have not been screened, vetted or processed yet by u.s. authorities. “that would be a pretty big stretch,” jenks said. and unlike the old order, the new one lays out with more detail why the specific countries were selected, she said.   attorneys challenging the ban, including the american civil liberties union said there were still questions about whether or not the ban is justified by national security reasons and the revisions do not address concerns that the order discriminates based on religion.  adam lauridsen, a keker & van nest attorney in san francisco representing students challenging trump’s first order, noted the revised directive still targets muslim majority countries.  stephen legomsky, chief counsel at u.s. citizenship and immigration services in the previous obama administration,     pointed to statements by trump about wanting a muslim ban. “that evidence is baked in, you can’t change the past,” said legomsky. he said, however, that does not mean the inevitable legal challenges will ultimately be successful in the likelihood that they reach the u.s. supreme court. “it’s not a slam dunk.” ",0
" president donald trump on sunday slapped new travel restrictions on citizens from north korea, venezuela and chad, expanding to eight the list of countries covered by his original travel bans that have been derided by critics and challenged in court. iran, libya, syria, yemen and somalia were left on the list of affected countries in a new proclamation issued by the president. restrictions on citizens from sudan were lifted. the measures help fulfill a campaign promise trump made to tighten u.s. immigration procedures and align with his  america first  foreign policy vision. unlike the president s original bans, which had time limits, this one is open ended.    making america safe is my number one priority. we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,  the president said in a tweet shortly after the proclamation was released. iraqi citizens will not be subject to travel prohibitions but will face enhanced scrutiny or vetting.  the current ban, enacted in march, was set to expire on sunday evening. the new restrictions are slated to take effect on oct. 18 and resulted from a review after trump s original travel bans sparked international outrage and legal challenges. the addition of north korea and venezuela broadens the restrictions from the original, mostly muslim majority list. an administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, acknowledged that the number of north koreans now traveling to the united states was very low.  rights group amnesty international usa condemned the measures.  just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government sanctioned discrimination,  it said in a statement.   it is senseless and cruel to ban whole nationalities of people who are often fleeing the very same violence that the u.s. government wishes to keep out. this must not be normalized.  the american civil liberties union said in a statement the addition of north korea and venezuela  doesn t obfuscate the real fact that the administration s order is still a muslim ban.  the white house portrayed the restrictions as consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. those requirements were shared in july with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the white house said.  a number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. others did not, sparking the restrictions. the announcement came as the u.s. supreme court prepares to hear oral arguments on oct. 10 over the legality of trump s previous travel ban, including whether it discriminated against muslims.  trump has threatened to  destroy  north korea if it attacks the united states or its allies. pyongyang earlier this month conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test. the president  has also directed harsh criticism at venezuela, once hinting at a potential military option to deal with caracas. but the officials described the addition of the two countries to trump s travel restrictions as the result of a purely objective review. in the case of north korea, where the suspension was sweeping and applied to both immigrants and non immigrants, officials said it was hard for the united states to validate the identity of someone coming from north korea or to find out if that person was a threat.  north korea, quite bluntly, does not cooperate whatsoever,  one official said.   the restrictions on venezuela focused on socialist government officials that the trump administration blamed for the country s slide into economic disarray, including officials from the bolivarian national intelligence service and their immediate families. trump received a set of policy recommendations on friday from acting secretary of homeland security elaine duke and was briefed on the matter by other administration officials, including attorney general jeff sessions and secretary of state rex tillerson, a white house aide said. the rollout on sunday was decidedly more organized than trump s first stab at a travel ban, which was unveiled with little warning and sparked protests at airports worldwide.    earlier on sunday, trump told reporters about the ban:  the tougher, the better.    rather than a total ban on entry to the united states, the proposed restrictions differ by nation, based on cooperation with american security mandates, the threat the united states believes each country presents and other variables, officials said.  somalis, for example, are barred from entering the united states as immigrants and subjected to greater screening for visits.     after the sept. 15 bombing attack on a london train, trump wrote on twitter that the new ban  should be far larger, tougher and more specific   but stupidly, that would not be politically correct.    the expiring ban blocked entry into the united states by people from the six countries for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give trump s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of u.s. vetting procedures for foreign visitors.   critics have accused the republican president of discriminating against muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law, breaking existing u.s. immigration law and stoking religious hatred.   some federal courts blocked the ban, but the u.s. supreme court allowed it to take effect in june

" a republican led panel in the u.s. house of representatives agreed on tuesday to add $7 million to a short term federal spending bill to reimburse new york authorities for president elect donald trump’s security costs, far short of the $35 million requested by the city’s congressional delegation. new york’s u.s. lawmakers were quick to express their unhappiness. “i am extremely disappointed that the continuing resolution to fund the federal government does not fully reimburse the people of new york for the unprecedented security costs incurred to keep the president elect and his family safe between the election and his inauguration,” u.s. democratic representative carolyn maloney said in a statement. the bill, which funds u.s. agencies through april 28, must pass before a friday deadline to keep government agencies running. at a capitol hill news conference earlier on tuesday, john miller, the new york police department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counter terrorism, said he was in contact with congressional democrats and republicans about the costs of security operations to protect trump both before and after the republican takes office on jan. 20. “this is not about party politics. it’s not about politics at all,” miller said. he said trump’s security “footprint” would be even “more complex” once he becomes president. representative nita lowey, a democrat, said the republican leadership of the house appropriations committee had expressed sympathy for the city’s pre inauguration reimbursement request but had asked for more specifics. several house democrats on tuesday also signed a letter to new york governor andrew cuomo and new york city mayor bill de blasio urging that the state and city “refuse to pay” for trump’s extra new york security costs once he is sworn in as president.  “should the president elect choose to maintain two permanent residences for his family, it is reasonable to request he reimburse the city and the state for all additional security expenses from his own significant personal financial resources,” the letter said. trump has said his wife, melania, and son barron will move from new york to the white house “right after he finishes school.” ",0
" president barack obama extolled the strengths of democracy from its greek birthplace on wednesday in a valedictory speech aimed at highlighting the values he sought to respect in office and prodding his republican successor, donald trump, to follow suit. on a farewell trip to europe, obama tried to reassure allies that core u.s. priorities, including a commitment to the nato military alliance, would continue under trump, despite the new york businessman’s campaign trail statements that called that commitment into question. obama portrayed the united states as an example of democracies prizing the peaceful transfer of power, even when ideas between the incoming and outgoing leaders are opposed. “the next american president and i could not be more different,” he said to an audience in athens. “we have very different points of view, but american democracy is bigger than any one person.”  obama took care of some local business in his speech. he urged creditors to help greece dig out of its mountain of debt and called on young people to stay in the country to spur its economic recovery. but his broader message extended beyond athens.  step by step, obama listed the values of u.s. democracy that he and fellow democrats in the united states have accused trump of violating during his presidential campaign, an implicit call on his successor to change course. in the same way that democracies are based on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within society, so cooperation is  the best way to resolve conflicts with nations, he said. “that’s how with diplomacy we were able to shut down iran’s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot (and) with diplomacy the united states opened relations with cuba,” obama said, referring to two important milestones of his presidency. he noted how u.s. democracy had evolved to provide rights to women, african americans, people with disabilities, and the gay community. trump has been criticized for his attitudes toward women and for making fun of a disabled reporter. he has pledged to ban muslims temporarily from entering the united states and to deport undocumented immigrants who are living in the country illegally. democracy is why the united states welcomes “people of all races, and all religions and all backgrounds and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life,” obama said. “our democracies show that we are stronger than terrorists, fundamentalists and absolutists, who can’t tolerate difference.  “democracy is stronger than organizations like isis,” he said, using one of the names for islamic state. “because our democracies are inclusive, we are able to welcome people, and refugees in need, to our countries. and nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in greece,” he said, referring to the greek response to europe’s migrant crisis. obama highlighted the importance of a free press to expose injustice. trump banned certain news outlets from his campaign events for writing stories he did not like. the obama administration has been criticized for its record on press freedom as well, particularly for prosecuting government sources who leak information to journalists.  in his speech, obama highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law. during his campaign, trump accused a u.s. judge of not being able to be impartial because of his mexican heritage. obama also noted that elections hold leaders accountable. “any action by a president or any result of an election or any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy,” he said.

" russia s defense ministry said on tuesday an employee had attached the wrong photos to a statement accusing the united states of providing de facto air cover for islamic state in syria after the mistake was spotted online. the ministry said it would investigate the incident, which it said was caused by a civilian employee, but did not say how or why the pictures used were incorrect.  however, the u.s. command s refusal to carry out strikes on the convoys of isil terrorists retreating from albu kamal on november 9 is an objective fact reflected in the transcripts of the talks and therefore, fully known to the u.s. side,  interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying on tuesday. earlier on tuesday, the ministry posted a statement on its facebook page saying the u.s. air force had tried to hinder russian strikes on islamic state militants, accompanied by satellite photographs it said showed a vehicle convoy of islamic state militants leaving the syrian town of albu kamal on nov. 9 2017. at least one of the photographs exactly matched a frame from a promotional video for a  ac 130 gunship simulator  computer game posted online in march 2015. reuters was unable to reach the game s argentinian developed, byte conveyor studios, for comment. asked about russian allegations of the u.s. helping islamic state around albu kamal, colonel ryan dillon, spokesman for the u.s. led coalition fighting islamic state, said:  the russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign and i think that is a reason for them to start, you know, coming out with their latest barrage of lies.   i certainly can t verify, but i ve seen the report that one of the pictures came from a video game. so, again that is pretty consistent with what we have seen come out of russian mod, as being baseless, inaccurate and you know, completely false,  he told a briefing with pentagon reporters on tuesday.

" the laws that prohibit foreign nationals from spending money to influence u.s. elections do not prevent them from lawfully buying some kinds of political ads on facebook and other online networks, campaign finance lawyers said. the omission of online ads could be a potential hurdle for those investigating alleged russian meddling in last year’s u.s. presidential election, according to the campaign finance lawyers, who are not involved in the probes. since 1974, the united states has barred foreign nationals from giving money to campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. the laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. at issue are laws concerning a category of ads known as “electioneering communications” that address where a candidate stands on an issue, that spread news stories about a candidate or that attack a candidate without directly calling for his or her defeat. foreign nationals cannot spend money on electioneering communications but the term under u.s. law applies only to communications made by broadcast, cable or satellite   with no mention of the internet. a related law does bar foreign nationals from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate in any advertising medium. but as long as online ads do not call on people to vote for a specific candidate, “they are not prohibited as a campaign finance matter,” said jan baran, a washington lawyer who frequently represents republican candidates. u.s. justice department special counsel robert mueller was appointed in may to investigate alleged russian interference as well as potential collusion between moscow and associates of president donald trump. the russian government says it did not meddle and trump has denied collusion.  facebook (fb.o), which has become a leading platform for online political ads, has said that it has not found any evidence that russian agents were buying ads.  facebook said in april, however, that it had become a battleground for governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries and outlined new measures to combat what it called “information operations.”  trump’s election campaign spent some $70 million on highly targeted facebook advertising last year, brad parscale, the digital director of the campaign, told reuters this year. the absence of rules governing online advertising ties the hands of the u.s. federal election commission, said ann ravel, a former democratic appointee to the commission. “the law seems to totally exempt it and therefore it is not possible either to reasonably determine who is behind those ads, do an investigation to find out or penalize for that activity,” ravel said. other laws could come into play in an investigation. the u.s. foreign agents registration act restricts publicity paid for by a foreign government such as russia.

" the united states has identified one person it might impose sanctions on over the brutal crackdown in myanmar against minority rohingya muslims and is examining others, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on friday. tillerson, who last month declared the violence against the rohingya to be  ethnic cleansing,  has said washington was considering  targeted sanctions  against those deemed responsible. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled to southern bangladesh since the end of august.  we are continuing to examine the circumstances around all of the events since the august attacks that have led to the enormous migration of people out of myanmar, and have already identified one individual and we are examining other possible individuals to hold responsible for targeted sanctions from the u.s.,  tillerson told reporters at the united nations. u.s. officials told reuters that president donald trump s administration was considering only limited action at this stage. they said it was preparing narrow, targeted u.s. sanctions against myanmar s military and could roll out the punitive measures by year end. the sanctions will be aimed at increasing pressure on myanmar authorities, but are not expected to hit the highest levels of the military leadership and will stop short of reimposing broad economic restrictions suspended under former  president barack obama, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. the limited nature of any new sanctions is expected to be seen as little more than a warning for myanmar and are not likely to satisfy international human rights groups and some u.s. lawmakers who have accused myanmar s armed forces of crimes against humanity. other world powers and the united nations called myanmar s campaign against the rohingya population  ethnic cleansing  well before the united states did so in late november. u.s. officials in washington and yangon have been looking in particular at ways to use the global magnitsky act, a law originally designed to target russian human rights violators, but which has recently been expanded to allow sanctions for abuses anywhere in the world, the sources said.  that can take the form of u.s. asset freezes as well as bans on travel to the united states. a spokesman for the u.s. state department said the administration was in the final stages of preparing this year s global magnitsky report and had taken  an expansive view of implementation  of the act in the past year, but could not say when it might be delivered. myanmar s powerful army chief, general min aung hlaing, is expected to be spared from the latest sanctions, according to three u.s. officials and a congressional aide familiar with the matter. in november, myanmar s military said it had replaced major general maung maung soe, the general in charge in rakhine state, but gave no reason for his transfer from a post as the head of the country s western command. it was not immediately clear how far down the chain of command the u.s. measures would reach and who might be named. two of the u.s. officials said the trump administration is considering only limited action at this stage to avoid upsetting the delicate political balance in myanmar, where the civilian led government headed  by nobel peace prize laureate aung san suu kyi must still contend with an influential military. washington also wants to hold tougher options in reserve to escalate the u.s. response if needed, the officials said. although the sanctions plan was still being finalized, the u.s. officials said the aim was to roll it out before the end of december, possibly before christmas, though one person close to the matter said an announcement could be delayed until early next year.  we have nothing to announce on sanctions,  a white house national security council spokesman said when asked the coming measures. he declined comment on who might be named. preparations for myanmar sanctions come at the same time that washington has expressed concern over the detention this week of two reuters journalists. wa lone and kyaw soe oo had worked on stories about the military crackdown on the rohingya population in rakhine state. rohingya refugees in bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly buddhist country was triggered by a military offensive in response to attacks by rohingya militant on security forces. washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian government in myanmar, where it competes for influence with china, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses.

" melania trump’s big night at the republican national convention failed to draw bumper television audiences despite networks boosting their coverage of the gathering and husband donald trump promising a “showbiz” feel to the week. according to nielsen ratings data on tuesday from seven leading broadcast and cable networks, an estimated 23 million people watched monday evening’s highlight during the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour when melania trump, the wife of republican white house contender donald trump, delivered her speech. the focus of the convention initially shifted on tuesday from the formal anointing of trump to accusations that sections of melania trump’s speech were strikingly similar to an address by michelle obama at the democratic convention in 2008. the early viewing figures were similar to those for the first night of the republican convention in 2012, which attracted an audience of 22.3 million, according to nielsen.  u.s. television networks have boosted coverage of the republican convention this year after trump, a new york businessman, drew huge audiences during the 2016 presidential debates during the state nominating contests. trump, the former star of “the apprentice” tv show, has promised to throw out traditional political convention scripts and “put some showbiz” into the mix.  media analysts predicted that viewership for trump’s acceptance speech this week for the republican presidential nomination could surpass the record 38 million who watched barack obama address the democratic convention in 2008. in 2012, the democratic convention generally drew more nightly tv viewers than the republican gathering, when mitt romney was running for the white house. on monday, the fox news cable channel, as expected, got the most viewers for its convention coverage, averaging 6.4 million in the 10 p.m. hour. among the mainstream networks, nbc led with 3.9 million. however, the biggest single program audience of monday night was for reality show “the bachelorette,” which was seen by some  6.6 million on abc. about 3 million people turned off when abc switched to the convention.

" russia rejected on tuesday a report by an international inquiry blaming the syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack, casting doubt on whether the u.n. security council can agree to extend the investigation s mandate before it expires next week. russia vetoed an initial u.s. bid to renew the joint  inquiry by the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw) on oct. 24, saying it wanted to wait for the release of the investigation s report two days later. it has since proposed its own rival draft resolution, which deputy russian u.n. ambassador vladimir safronkov said on tuesday aimed to enhance the effectiveness of the inquiry and correct  errors and systemic problems.   without a comprehensive change it will become a tool to settle accounts with the syrian authorities,  safronkov told the 15 member security council on tuesday during a meeting on the report by the u.n./opcw joint investigative mechanism (jim). the report found the syrian government was responsible for an april 4 attack using the banned nerve agent sarin in the opposition held town of khan sheikhoun, killing dozens of people. the syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. the chemical weapons attack prompted a u.s. missile strike just days later against a syrian air base.  russia is trying to shoot the messenger to cover up for the crimes of the syrian regime,  deputy british u.n. ambassador jonathan allen told the security council. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said there could be no higher priority for the security council than renewing the jim mandate. diplomats said the united states had amended its draft resolution in a bid to win russian support.  anyone who prevents us from achieving this goal is aiding and abetting those who have been using chemical weapons,  haley said.  they are helping to ensure, not just that more women and children will die, but that those women and children will die in one of the cruelest, most painful ways possible.  a resolution must get nine votes in favor and no vetoes by russia, china, the united states, britain and france to pass. allen told reporters the russian draft resolution  has very little if any support in the council and no realistic prospects of success.  the jim had previously found that syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that islamic state militants used mustard gas. syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by russia and the united states.

"it s memorial day, which means that most across the country will be barbecuing, spending time at the beach or just relaxing. others are being reverent, remembering those who were lost during the nation s numerous wars. there s a new tradition, though, and conservatives won t be happy. the tradition is to burn the confederate flag.it started lat year and it wasn t big. several, including artists, and anyone who hates the tradition of southern racism, joined together in an attempt to enlighten the world on what the confederate flag stands for. the confederate flag is the n-word on a pole,  said sarasota, florida, artist john sims, who coordinated symbolic burials of the confederate flag on monday in the 13 states represented by the stars of the flag, including tennessee, kentucky, louisiana and mississippi. source: ib timesthis year, organizer john sims hopes that the movement will spread. last year, it was over just 13 cities. this year, it could be nationwide, although you don t see a lot of confederate flags outside of the south. so, sims has made it easier. he s created a  burn and bury  kit that can be downloaded. you don t even have to buy anything. you can print it.while this will definitely anger trump voters (watch for lots of cries of  political correctness. ), that s not why sims is doing it. he, like so many in this country, hate what the flag stands for.southern heritage groups like the sons of confederate veterans  have failed to recognized the unredeemable nature of the confederate flag as symbol of southern heritage,  sims told think progress.  and to deny this flag s connection to american white supremacy and fear of the loss of white privilege is insane. i challenge the sons of confederate veterans to come correct and acknowledge that the confederate flag should be retired as an artifact. and after that they should help advocate for reparations for slavery. he added he hoped burn and bury memorial day would  ritualistically confront through reflection and catharsis, the pain and trauma of a very horrific part of american history. source: yahoofor those who defend the flag as just being part of southern history, it is, but it s a shameful part of southern history. here s the designer of the confederate flag, thompson, speaking for himself:image courtesy of micthompson went on to describe it as a white man s flag:according to a recent survey, republicans still love the thing. fewer than half of republicans believe the flag is racist.",1

" a former u.s. representative whose lavish washington office raised questions about use of taxpayer money pleaded not guilty on monday to charges of defrauding the federal government and campaign committees, then trying to cover it up. aaron schock, a 35 year old former republican congressman from illinois, was indicted in november by the u.s. department of justice on 24 counts, including wire fraud, theft of government funds and filing false federal income tax returns. he entered his plea in a federal court in springfield, illinois. “i look forward to the truth and all the facts coming out in this case. i have complete faith in my legal team, the good people of this community, and that justice will ultimately prevail,” schock said in an emailed statement. schock, elected to the, u.s. house of representatives in 2008 at the age of 27, gained a following by posting flashy photos on social media of himself traveling around the world.  but he was hounded with questions after the washington post reported last year about lavish decorations in his capitol hill office based on the pbs period melodrama “downton abbey.”  although staff told the post that the interior design work had been done for free, the story prompted more investigations into schock’s spending habits, with several media outlets reporting he failed to disclose some expenditures and had to repay others after improperly using taxpayer funds.

" republican donald trump said on monday he would work closely with nato allies to defeat islamic state militants if he wins the white house, reversing an earlier threat that the united states might not meet its obligations to the western military alliance. in a policy speech, trump said he would wage a multi front “military, cyber and financial” war against islamic state, although it was not clear how that would differ from the obama administration’s fight with the jihadist group.  “we will also work closely with nato on this new mission,” said trump, whose remarks about the defense organization earlier this summer drew heavy criticism from allies and even some of his fellow republicans. trump said a newly adopted approach to fighting terrorism by the organization had led him to change his mind and he no longer considered nato obsolete. he was apparently referring to reports the alliance is moving toward creating an intelligence post in a bid to improve information sharing.    while trump appeared to claim credit for prodding nato to focus more on the threat of terrorism, the 28 nation alliance has been grappling with the issue for more than a decade. nato invoked article 5, its collective self defense mechanism, for the first time in its history to offer support to the united states after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. trump called for shutting down access to the internet and social media for those aligned with islamic state, which holds territory in syria and iraq. but he said he did not want to detail military strategy because it would tip off potential foes. “we will defeat radical islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we’ve faced at every age and before,” trump said, blaming his democratic rival, hillary clinton, the former secretary of state, and president barack obama for aiding the rise of islamic state. in a speech in the swing state of ohio, trump also said that in implementing his call for a temporary ban on muslims immigrating to the country, he would institute “extreme vetting” and develop a new screening test to try to catch people who intend to do harm to the united states. as president, he said, he would ask the u.s. state department and department of homeland security to identify regions of the world that remain hostile to the united states and where normal screening might not be sufficient to catch those who pose a threat. the clinton campaign said trump’s plan to have immigrants submit to ideological tests was “a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it.” reading from a teleprompter, trump said clinton did not have the judgment and character to lead the country. “importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and all of the many adversaries we face,” he said.  trump, a wealthy new york businessman whose volatile campaign has alienated some in the republican establishment, faced a fresh rebuke on monday as he falls behind clinton in opinion polls ahead of the nov. 8 election. the wall street journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial he should fix his campaign within weeks or step down. echoing growing alarm about trump’s candidacy among many leading republicans, the newspaper said trump had failed to establish a competent campaign operation. “if they can’t get mr. trump to change his act by labor day, the gop will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the senate and house and other down ballot races,” the newspaper said. labor day, which falls on sept. 5 this year, marks the end of u.s. summer vacations and traditionally launches the final phase of the long u.s. election season.  “as for mr. trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president   or turn the nomination over to mike pence,” it said, referring to the indiana governor, who is trump’s vice presidential running mate. adding to trump’s woes this week was the news, first reported by the new york times, that the name of his campaign manager, paul manafort, was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a ukrainian political party with close ties to russia.  manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on monday.   “i have never received a single ‘off the books cash payment’ as falsely ‘reported’ by the new york times, nor have i ever done work for the governments of ukraine or russia,” he said.  artem sytnik, the head of ukraine’s anti corruption bureau, confirmed in a briefing with reporters that manafort’s name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure, referencing manafort. but sytnik said the presence of manafort’s name “does not mean that he definitely received this money.” the clinton campaign said the news was evidence of “more troubling connections between donald trump’s team and pro kremlin elements in ukraine.” trump has spoken favorably in the past of russian president vladimir putin. last month, he invited russian hackers to find “missing” emails from clinton’s time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that comment as sarcasm.    the current realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton 6.8 points ahead of trump, at 47.8 percent to trump’s 41 percent. polls also show trump trailing in states such as pennsylvania that are likely to be pivotal in the election.

" the republican chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee said on monday that if the house of representatives does not pass a russian sanctions bill, it is because members do not want to impose new sanctions, not because of a procedural issue cited by republican leaders in the house.  “there is no issue, except do they want to pass a russia sanctions bill or not,” senator bob corker told reporters at the u.s. senate. the senate passed the sanctions measure by 98 2 on june 15, but it has been stalled in the house, where president donald trump’s fellow republicans hold a larger majority than in the senate. house republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the house, not the senate. they also blamed democrats for holding it up. democrats, and some republicans, scoffed. they said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the house in a matter of minutes. trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get congress’ permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons. some republicans have also echoed concerns raised by u.s. energy firms and european governments that the legislation could complicate investment in russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs. corker said the bill was written to allow the trump administration to address energy related issues. and he said any white house would prefer to conduct foreign policy without congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill. “no one has called me and said, ‘we don’t want this legislation to pass.’ that has never occurred,” corker said. lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure. the senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on june 29, with a “fix” to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the house. house republicans said on monday that the senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the senate would have to change it and vote again.

" republican presidential nominee donald trump acknowledged on thursday that his campaign was struggling in utah, a usually rock solid republican state, on a day in which he briefly set aside his self confidence for a rare display of doubt.  trump made the comment in urging conservative christian evangelicals to organize support for him in several key states where the nov. 8 election is likely to be decided, such as ohio, florida and virginia. the wealthy new york businessman has suffered a number of self inflicted wounds in recent days that have given the advantage in the campaign to democrat hillary clinton. “we’re having a tremendous problem in utah,” trump told a conference room filled with evangelical pastors, blaming a “false narrative” that has been built up around his candidacy. he has repeatedly blamed the news media for dishonest tactics. a surveyusa opinion poll conducted for the salt lake tribune in june showed clinton and trump tied. other polls have given trump a lead but not the type of advantage that previous republican nominees have enjoyed in the state. the normally confident trump never apologizes and is loathe to admit that he might face difficulties. but in talking to the national association of home builders earlier in miami beach, trump admitted his past years before he became a politician could be causing him problems now. “if i had planned for it, i wouldn’t have had such a rocky path,” he said. “i wouldn’t have spoken to howard so much.” that was a reference to his many appearances on the “howard stern show” radio program. he has been estimated to have appeared on the show more than two dozen times over 20 years, and the conversation frequently turned ribald.  trump, who is trailing clinton in virginia, a formerly republican state that democratic president barack obama won in 2008 and 2012, urged evangelicals to help him in that state as well. in doing so, trump pledged to rewrite the so called johnson amendment, the 1954 change in the u.s. tax code that prohibits church leaders from using the pulpit for political purposes. “if we get those people to vote, we’re going to win in virginia,” he said. “if they don’t vote, it’s not going to happen.” trump also said “we need help in ohio,” the state where he held his republican national convention last month. ohio governor john kasich, who lost to trump in the republican primary race, has refused to endorse trump. “we’re very close in ohio, but we need help,” trump said. trump has seen a steady stream of moderate republicans vow not to support him, such as u.s. senator susan collins of maine, and 50 republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him.  all this is evidence of fissures in the party over the bellicose rhetoric and positions of trump, who on wednesday called obama “the founder of isis,” the acronym for islamic state, and clinton “the co founder.” trump joked that winning the white house and doing a good job as president might be his only way to salvation. “so go out and spread the words and once i get in, i will do the thing that i do very well,” said trump with a smile. “i figure it’s probably maybe the only way i’m going to get to heaven, so i better do a good job.” ",0
" democrat hillary clinton’s unexpected defeat in michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against republican front runner donald trump. trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect american workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled clinton’s rival bernie sanders to victory in the midwestern state on tuesday. clinton remains heavily favored to win the democratic nomination. but the setback in michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other rust belt states such as ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said. the backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the trans pacific partnership (tpp), a sweeping pacific trade deal backed by president barack obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come. “it’s politically radioactive to support free trade right now,” said greg valliere, a washington analyst for horizon investments, a financial firm. clinton’s troubles with her party’s left wing — and with white, working class voters more generally — may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as senator sherrod brown of ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said democratic strategist steve jarding. political pundits had expected clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to hispanic or other minority voters, such as u.s. housing and urban development julian castro. sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as clinton’s running mate, partly due to his age, democrats said. both sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire trump have harnessed anti trade sentiment in their insurgent white house bids, criticizing deals like nafta as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working americans. exit polls from michigan, a hub of the u.s. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped sanders and trump win their respective party primaries.  “she made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,” democratic strategist steve jarding said of clinton. “this cycle, there is no center.” sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. some 58 percent of his supporters in michigan exit polls said that trade takes away u.s. jobs, while a slight majority   53 percent   of clinton backers said trade creates u.s. jobs. the economic policy institute, a left leaning think tank, estimates that michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if tpp were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state. gary hunley, a substitute teacher in dearborn, michigan, said he believed clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because nafta was enacted under her husband bill clinton’s presidency in the 1990s. “she was not a passive first lady,” hunley said. clinton’s stance on trade is more nuanced than trump’s and sanders’. after nafta was enacted, she voted against a free trade deal with central america while serving as a u.s. senator in the following decade. as obama’s secretary of state, clinton helped negotiate the tpp with japan, vietnam and other pacific rim countries.  as a presidential candidate, clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect u.s. workers.  clinton campaign manager robby mook told reporters wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would “put secretary clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,” including trump.  despite backing by the obama administration, republican lawmakers and many business groups, republican leaders in congress have shown no sign that they will bring tpp up for a  vote this year. the obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of nafta. “i’m not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,” u.s. national security adviser susan rice told reuters. [l1n16h1vj] the deal may fare no better under the next president. sanders and trump oppose tpp, and senator ted cruz, who is in second place in the republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year. “they’ve listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,” brown, the ohio democratic senator, told reuters. the evidence that the tpp would help the u.s. economy much is less than conclusive. the peter g. peterson institute, a pro trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years. the deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a “churn” of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.  another estimate by the global development and environment institute at tufts university found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the united states.

" national security adviser michael flynn’s resignation under fire was just the latest in a series of controversies that have embroiled the trump administration since it took office on jan. 20.  here are several of the tempests that have swirled around the new white house: flynn quit on monday after misleading the white house about his contacts with russia before taking office and president donald trump lost trust in him, white house spokesman sean spicer said. u.s. lawmakers, including some leading republicans, called for an investigation. national security at mar a lago private guests at trump’s mar a lago resort in florida snapped photos of the president and visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe conferring and looking at documents while surrounded by aides following a weekend missile launch by north korea. one guest posted to his facebook page a picture with a man described to be the holder of the “nuclear football,” or weapons codes. the incidents prompted concerns about national security, and a republican representative asked the white house for details. trump issued an executive order on jan. 27 temporarily banning u.s. entry by travelers from seven muslim majority countries and all refugees, citing the need to protect americans. the ban triggered protests across the united states, confusion at u.s. and overseas airports and multiple legal challenges. a federal judge in seattle on feb. 3 suspended the ban in an order upheld by a federal appeals court in san francisco. the seattle judge’s order drew fire from trump on twitter, who criticized the jurist and the court system. the republican president’s supreme court nominee, neil gorsuch, said last week that the twitter attacks were “demoralizing” and “disheartening,” according to a spokesman. trump said gorsuch’s comments had been misrepresented. trump senior adviser kellyanne conway urged americans last week to buy his daughter ivanka trump’s clothing and jewelry products during an appearance on a national television program after department store chain nordstrom inc said it was dropping them due to a decline in sales. conway’s endorsement, which followed a twitter attack by trump on nordstrom, prompted criticism from democrats and republicans. on tuesday, the office of government ethics said the white house should investigate whether conway violated ethics rules. trump’s nominee to head the labor department, fast food executive andrew puzder, admitted on feb. 7 he employed an illegal immigrant as a house cleaner. puzder, who already faced strong opposition from senate democrats and progressive groups because of his views on labor issues, said he and his wife had employed the housekeeper for a few years without knowing she was not legally permitted to work in the country. he said that when he learned of her status, he and his wife ended her employment and offered her help in getting legal status. mexican president enrique pena nieto scrapped plans to meet his counterpart in washington during the second week of trump’s presidency after trump tweeted that mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. trump abruptly ended a phone call in late january with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull, telling the leader of one of the united states’ closest allies that it was the “worst call by far” he had had with a foreign leader, according to the washington post. trump said a deal between the united states and australia on refugee resettlement was “dumb” and accused turnbull’s country of trying to export the “next boston bombers” under the agreement, the post said.

" republican u.s. representative trent franks said on thursday he would resign after two female staffers complained that he had discussed surrogacy with them. franks, 60, who has been a member of congress from arizona since 2003, said in a statement that he would step down on jan. 31. the house of representatives ethics committee said on thursday it had opened an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against franks. the congressman said he was resigning because coverage of the committee’s investigation in the “current cultural and media climate” would “damage those things i love most.” franks said he and his wife had struggled with infertility and sought a surrogate in order to have another child after they had twins with a surrogate. “i have recently learned that the ethics committee is reviewing an inquiry regarding my discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable,” franks said. “i deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,” he said. franks denied he ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.” u.s. house speaker paul ryan was briefed on the allegations on nov. 29 and urged franks to resign in a conversation the following day, ryan’s office said in a statement. “the speaker takes seriously his obligation to ensure a safe workplace in the house,” the statement said. franks, a member of the conservative house freedom caucus, represents arizona’s 8th congressional district, a mainly suburban area of phoenix. he won re election in 2016 with 68.5 percent of the vote. republican president donald trump carried the district by 21 points last year.  republican arizona governor doug ducey will call a special election to fill the seat. the nominating primary must be held between 80 and 90 days after the vacancy and the general election must be conducted 50 to 60 days after the primary, according to state law. numerous prominent men in u.s. politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct.  earlier on thursday, democratic senator al franken of minnesota said he would resign in a few weeks following allegations of sexual misconduct. u.s. democratic representative john conyers of michigan resigned on tuesday after accusations of sexual harassment were leveled against him. conyers denied the allegations, while franken said some of the accusations against him were untrue and he remembered other incidents differently from his accusers. reuters has not verified the allegations against either man.

" saudi arabia on friday rejected a united nations report blaming a saudi led military coalition for killing or injuring 683 children in yemen and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals as  inaccurate and misleading.    we exercise the maximum degree of care and precaution to avoid civilian harm,  saudi u.n. ambassador abdallah al mouallimi told reporters at the united nations.  in a report submitted to the u.n. security council on thursday, u.n. secretary general antonio guterres blacklisted the saudi led coalition for its 2016 actions   even as he said it had taken action to improve child protection.  the kingdom of saudi arabia and the coalition reaffirm that it is taking important measures to protect civilians during all military operations to end the suffering of the yemeni people and minimize the humanitarian cost,  mouallimi said.   we reject the inaccurate and misleading information and figures contained in the report and we express our strong reservation with respect to this information,  he said.  the coalition had been briefly added to the u.n. blacklist last year and removed by then secretary general ban ki moon pending review. at the time, ban accused saudi arabia of exerting  unacceptable  undue pressure after sources told reuters that riyadh threatened to cut some u.n. funding. saudi arabia denied this. in an effort to dampen controversy surrounding the report, the blacklist this year is split into two categories. one lists parties that have put in place measures to protect children,  which includes the saudi led military coalition, and the other includes parties that have not. the report does not subject those listed to u.n. action but rather shames parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which president abd rabu mansour hadi s government, backed by the saudi led coalition, is fighting to drive the houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015. more than 10,000 people have been killed and the conflict has ruined the economy and pushed millions to the brink of famine.  mouallimi blamed the iran allied houthi rebels and forces loyal to yemen s ex president ali abdullah saleh for putting civilians at risk, including using children as human shields. the u.n. blacklist also named the houthi rebel group, yemen government forces, pro government militia and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula for violations against children in 2016.

" china will not export its political system, president xi jinping told a forum for foreign political groups on friday, as the ruling communist party seeks to boost its global image and take a more assertive international role. china s state media has this year touted the annual inter party meeting as a  high level dialogue  with xi speaking at it for the first time. xi told the forum s opening session china was  struggling for the cause of human progress  and it would bring benefits to every country in the world, according to state television.  we will not import other countries  models, and will not export the china model,  xi said.  we will provide more opportunities for the world through our development,  he said. the official xinhua news agency has said that representatives from hundreds of political parties in more than 120 countries have registered for the four day meeting, though it has not provided a full list. myanmar s leader aung san suu kyi, cambodian prime minister hun sen and tony parker, treasurer of the u.s. republican national committee, were among attendees who spoke at the forum s opening. at a chinese communist party (cpp) congress in october, where xi cemented his power, he laid out a confident vision for a proud and prosperous china in a  new era  under his leadership.  at the time, he also called on the communist party, as the world s biggest political party with 89 million members, to have a  big image . china has expanded the reach of its foreign policy and military under xi, whose  diplomatic thought  has been credited domestically with transcending 300 years of western international relations theory and serving as a marker of china s growing soft power. but concern abroad about china using its influence to sway foreign business, academic, and political institutions have grown in tandem. some foreign business has been alarmed by the increased push for influence by communist party units in their operations and joint ventures, and international publishers have sparked academic freedom controversies by pulling content that offends beijing.  jude blanchette, an expert on china s communist party at the conference board s china center for economics and business in beijing, said xi and the party had been re articulating the idea of a  china solution  for governments around the world.  in isolation, the meeting will be forgotten by next week, but it s a small piece in a much larger strategy to rebrand the ccp from a reactive organization on the wrong side of history into a political force at the center of the global conversation,  blanchette said.

" a german court sentenced a 27 year old german supporter of islamic state to three years and three months in prison on monday for plotting to lure police or soldiers into a trap and kill them with a home made bomb. the ruling came with german authorities on high alert ahead of tuesday s anniversary of an attack last year in which a failed tunisian asylum seeker plowed a truck into crowds at an outdoor christmas market and killed 12 people. prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as sascha l., had carried out two successful tests of a home made explosive device in his hometown in january.  an inquiry found two videos of the accused pledging allegiance to islamic state s leader. however, the court ruled on monday that there was no evidence that the man had a personal connection with the islamist militia or that he was financially supported by the militia, german broadcaster ndr reported. ndr said the court granted him leniency since he cooperated with authorities after his arrest and confessed his plans.  german magazine der spiegel had reported that the man was part of the far right scene in the past before converting to salafism, an ultra conservative islamist creed. the man, who was arrested in february, admitted planning an attack. chemicals that could be used to make explosive devices were found during a search of his home in the town of northeim in central germany. three men charged as accomplices of the convicted man also appeared before the court. two were convicted, with one sentenced to three years probation and the other to 100 hours of community service. the third person was acquitted.  last week, german police raided nine locations in berlin and the eastern state of saxony anhalt in an investigation of four people suspected of planning an islamist motivated attack.

" president barack obama and the first lady will visit the lake side patagonian tourist city of bariloche later this month during an official trip to argentina, a u.s. diplomat told local radio on friday. the trip will follow the couple’s visit to cuba on march 21 and 22, another major step toward ending decades of animosity between former cold war foes. they will meet with newly elected argentine president mauricio macri on march 23 and fly to bariloche the following day, kevin sullivan, deputy chief of mission at the u.s. embassy in buenos aires, told radio mitre. the stopover in ski destination bariloche, known for its crystal clear lakes and panoramic mountain vistas, appeared to be first lady michelle obama’s idea, sullivan said. “i believe she heard what bariloche is like ... and it seemed to her it would be a good place to share a little family time,” sullivan said. relations have improved between argentina and the united states since macri took office in december. macri has moved to open latin america’s no. 3 economy to foreign investment by ditching trade and currency controls enacted by his predecessor. “it seems to us to be a good moment for president obama to get to know argentina and have a dialogue with president macri,” sullivan said. the agenda will include international cooperation, terrorism, human rights and energy investment. argentina has some of the world’s largest untapped shale oil and natural gas formations. china is a major investor in argentina’s energy and grains sectors.  march 24 will be the 40th anniversary of the 1976 coup that installed a military dictatorship, which the united states initially supported. argentina returned to democracy in 1983. adolfo perez esquivel, who won the nobel peace prize for his human rights work during the dictatorship, wrote an open letter to obama this week saying that if the u.s. president stayed in buenos aires on the 24th, many argentines would see that as “a provocation.” marches and demonstrations in honor of the victims of the military junta are planned for that date in the argentine capital.

" u.s. senator john mccain said on sunday he would like relations between united states and pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the islamic state and other radical islamist groups. relations between pakistan and united states have been frayed over the past decade, with u.s. officials frustrated by what they term islamabad’s unwillingness to act against islamist groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network. pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple islamist groups and is wary of “blowback” in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  mccain, visiting pakistan as part of a u.s. delegation, said he had an “excellent meeting” with pakistani foreign ministry officials. “we come back with a message that we have a common enemy in isis, radical islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,” mccain told pakistan’s national ptv channel. relations between united states and pakistan were tested again in may by a u.s. drone strike that killed afghan taliban chief mullah akhtar mansour on pakistani soil.  as part of the visit, mccain traveled to miranshah, the capital of the restive north waziristan region bordering afghanistan. the region was effectively run islamists by groups such as the pakistani taliban and the haqqani network until the pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. “i was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),” said mccain, who is the chairman of the senate armed services committee. “i see us working together in confronting a common challenge – radical islamic terrorism – and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,” mccain added. the islamic state has struggled to gain a major foothold in pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  pakistan said the country’s top foreign policy official sartaj aziz had briefed the u.s. delegation   which includes senators lindsey graham, benjamin sasse and joe donnelly   about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in afghanistan. so far china, united states and pakistan have struggled to persuade the afghan taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. “no country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as pakistan, (aziz) remarked,” pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

" republican paul ryan was re elected to the u.s. house of representatives by voters in his wisconsin district on tuesday, positioning him to reassert his claim to remain speaker of the house, the highest ranking post in the u.s. congress. the 2012 vice presidential nominee, if returned to the speaker’s chair by house members, may have a smaller republican majority to work with if voters elect fewer republicans. most house races were still undecided. like all members of the house, other republicans were also running for re election from their home districts, including house majority leader kevin mccarthy of california and house majority whip steve scalise of louisiana. along with ryan, they were expected to seek re election to their leadership posts. closed door leadership elections in both parties were expected to take place later in november. a new speaker will be elected by all members of congress in january. ryan, 46, has been speaker since october 2015. his re election to that job is not certain. some house conservatives have criticized him, and they may have a stronger hand after tuesday’s voting. a number of republican lawmakers were angered in october when ryan said he would not campaign with or defend republican presidential nominee donald trump, who was in a closely fought race with democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton on tuesday night.

" having spent billions of dollars on post crisis u.s. financial industry reforms they once scorned, bankers are concerned the trump administration, joined by a like minded congress, will scrap or significantly change the rules. to comply with a rule known as dodd frank, which was enacted in 2010 following the financial crisis, big u.s banks hired tens of thousands of staffers, built new technology systems, hived off businesses, simplified corporate structures and doubled the amount of capital they hold. jpmorgan chase & co has said that in its mortgage business alone, employees spent 800,000 hours in compliance training in a single year. the industry went into these changes kicking and screaming. banks lobbied hard against dodd frank as it was being drafted, then cajoled regulators to go easy in defining and implementing precise rules. but now that the heavy lifting has been done and dodd frank is largely in effect, the industry see a total  elimination as more of a threat than a blessing. dodd frank has largely made banks safer and the once opaque derivatives market more transparent, banking executives said.  president elect donald trump, who takes office on jan. 20, and some important lawmakers in the incoming republican congress have pledged to dismantle the law and put a new one in place. it is not yet clear what the replacement would look like, but texas republican jeb hensarling, who chairs the house financial services committee, has drafted a blueprint called the choice act. the proposal has a mix of things the industry largely supports, such as abolishing the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), but it also has some ideas wall street vehemently opposes, like ramping up capital requirements to a level that would likely force big banks to split apart. proposed changes are also likely to run into stiff opposition from some congressional democrats, particularly senator elizabeth warren, architect of the cfpb. big u.s. banks including jpmorgan, bank of america corp, citigroup inc, wells fargo & co, goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley have seen big gains in their share prices since the nov. 8 election, partly on expectations that regulators will soon have a much lighter touch. “there is scope for lower taxes, less regulation, and more growth,” morgan stanley analysts said in a report on tuesday recommending big bank stocks. however, bankers, lawyers and consultants who spoke to reuters said any big rollback in rulemaking could take several years to implement and may introduce more costs. “one of the dangers of dismantling regulation is that it will be costly and disruptive,” said mike alix, a consultant at pwc who works with banks on regulatory matters. “by and large they’ve gotten themselves into shape and they’re not looking to get out of shape.” industry sources said they are hoping it’s possible to roll back some elements of dodd frank that they view as too onerous or misguided, without scrapping the entire law. for instance, many would like to see the volcker rule, which places restrictions on proprietary trading, go away. the rule was intended to prevent federally insured banks from placing speculative bets in the markets, and would be repealed as part of hensarling’s plan. some banks are taking a second look at compliance initiatives until they gain further clarity on what will happen in washington. at a conference this month, bank of america corp chief operating officer tom montag said he is being “a little more cautious” about compliance spending. it is difficult to know whether it is worth spending another $30 million on volcker rule compliance, he said, because doing so may be a waste of money but not doing so could leave the bank at risk if the rule is implemented as planned. “even if volcker doesn’t go away, there are still questions about how tough the enforcement would be,” said mark nuccio, who leads the bank regulatory practice at law firm ropes & gray llp. “banks are deciding they may take the foot off the gas pedal now and just see what happens.” ",0
" hillary clinton said on friday that if elected to the white house she would create an oversight panel to protect u.s. consumers from large price hikes on long available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices. clinton, the democratic presidential candidate, would seek to give the panel an “aggressive new set of enforcement tools,” including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an “unjustified, outlier price increase” on a long available or generic drug, her campaign said. “over the past year, we’ve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long standing, life saving treatments with little or no new innovation or r&d,” clinton said in a statement. if clinton defeats republican rival donald trump in the nov. 8 election, she would need the support of the u.s. congress to implement key measures of her proposal, which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago. even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies, it could be difficult to get republican lawmakers on board, morningstar analyst damien conover said, adding that a “republican congress would push back hard on this.” clinton’s campaign cited turing pharmaceuticals llc’s raising the price of its aids drug daraprim (pyrimethamine) and mylan nv’s repeated steep price increases on epipen for severe allergy sufferers as “troubling” examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. conover said clinton’s plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall. drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies. the arca pharmaceutical index of large u.s. and european drugmakers rose 0.30 percent on friday, in line with gains for the broad stock market. shares of mylan fell 4.6 percent to $40.00 on the nasdaq. the nasdaq biotech index slipped 0.40 percent. the decline was slight compared to the more than 4.7 percent drop in the index seen on sept. 21, 2015, when clinton blasted “price gouging” in the specialty drug market on twitter, responding to reports that turing had acquired daraprim, an older antibiotic, and then hiked its price by 5,000 percent.  soon afterward, clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs, including allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs.  her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out of pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. it aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products, and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising. dr. peter bach, the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at new york’s memorial sloan kettering cancer center, said clinton’s announcement on friday was a “flag” for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes. “it’s a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition,” bach said, saying the campaign was focusing on a “sub category” of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug. bach said he was contacted by the clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity. the oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase, the manufacturer’s production cost and the treatment’s relative value to patients and public health, clinton’s campaign said. terry haines, head of political analysis for evercore isi, said clinton’s proposed panel had little hope of getting through congress.  but clinton, if elected, might be able to achieve price reform via changes to medicare’s prescription drug benefit, known as medicare part d, if she works with congress to reform the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, haines said. in that event, haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come “under sustained headline risk in 2017 as aca reforms are discussed.”         in cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition, clinton’s administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the united states. dr. aaron kesselheim, an associate professor at harvard medical school, called it a “bold idea” to get the federal government “involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets.” until recently, there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the u.s. food and drug administration. although the wait time has shortened, there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the u.s. market, kesselheim said. “having the government get involved as a long term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market,” he said. kesselheim has testified before congress about high cost generic and long available drugs and spoke to clinton’s campaign about his research as it developed its proposals.

" u.s. president barack obama lacerated donald trump on tuesday over his repeated assertions that the nov. 8 election is rigged against him, telling the republican presidential candidate to “stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” with opinion polls showing him falling further back against his white house rival, democrat hillary clinton, trump has intensified his allegations, although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in u.s. elections is rare. at a campaign rally in grand junction, colorado, trump continued his attack, saying, “the press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters.” but he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president: a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of congress, six years for members of the house of representatives, 12 years for members of the senate. obama was asked about trump’s voter fraud assertions on tuesday at a joint news conference in the white house rose garden following meetings with italian prime minister matteo renzi. he responded with a blistering attack on the republican candidate, noting that u.s. elections are run and monitored by local officials, who may well be appointed by republican governors of states, and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in american elections. obama said there was “no serious” person who would suggest it was possible to rig american elections, adding, “i’d invite mr. trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” trump, speaking at the grand junction rally tuesday evening, said that obama should stop campaigning for “crooked hillary” and “get out and work on jobs and work on the border.” trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the november election result, citing scant or questionable evidence, including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people, and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on election day. he has sharpened his allegations even as republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded. in a report titled “the truth about voter fraud,” the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent. an august study by the washington post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. arizona state university studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates. in pointed remarks that were part civics lesson, obama said that if trump wins on nov. 8, “it would be my expectation of hillary clinton to offer a gracious concession speech” and “it would be my job ... and escort him over to the capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power” at his swearing in. trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, took a softer tone than trump during a campaign appearance in north carolina, saying he was “confident” that the integrity of the election will be ensured. but pence added that “in recent years we’ve had instances, proven instances of voter fraud.” a number of republican led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter identification requirements. but several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.   trump trails clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls, according to an average of polls compiled by realclear politics. over the last few weeks, trump, who has never previously run for office, has been embroiled in one controversy after another, eclipsing policy issues such as taxes, trade, the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns. with three weeks left until election day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states, trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. he has said the remarks were just “locker room” talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say trump groped or touched them inappropriately, denouncing his accusers as liars and fame seekers. the controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates, to be held on wednesday evening in las vegas. trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate. he appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate, but according to polling, more voters saw clinton as the victor. wednesday’s debate, like the first one, will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions. topics chosen by moderator chris wallace include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the supreme court, foreign hot spots, and fitness to be president.  at tuesday’s press conference, obama also criticized trump for his “continued flattery” of russian president vladimir putin, saying “it is out of step with” the country. trump has praised putin as a strong leader and on monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the russian leader before he is even sworn in as president.

" a series of recent cyber attacks has netted north korean hackers millions of dollars in virtual currencies like bitcoin, with more attacks expected as international sanctions drive the country to seek new sources of cash, researchers say. north korea s government backed hackers have been blamed for a rising number of cyber attacks, including the so called wannacry cyber attack that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe this year. analysts say the explosive growth in the value of bitcoin makes it and other  cryptocurrencies  an attractive target for north korea, which has become increasingly isolated under international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and missile programs.  bitcoin was trading at over $19,104 per bitcoin at one point on tuesday, up from less than $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, according to coinmarketcap.com.    researchers in south korea, which hosts some of the world s busiest virtual currency exchanges and accounts for 15 to 25 percent of world bitcoin trading on any given day, say attacks this year on exchanges like bithumb, coinis, and youbit have the digital fingerprints of hackers from north korea. the researchers  findings have not been independently verified. north korea has rejected accusations that it has been involved in hacking. a spokesman for south korea s unification ministry, which handles north korean affairs, said on monday the government was considering  countermeasures , including more sanctions, over the cyber attacks. representatives of bithumb and coinis declined to comment. on monday, a youbit spokeswoman told reuters the company had not been targeted by north korean hackers, and on tuesday the company announced it had suffered another cyber attack that cost it 17 percent of its assets, forcing the exchange to halt operations and file for bankruptcy. the hackers behind the second attack were not identified, but one cyber security researcher, who said he was not authorized to speak about the matter as it was being investigated, said there were similarities between the youbit hack reported on tuesday and the earlier attack on the company, which has been linked to north korea. another researcher, who worked with youbit after the first hack in april, said the company has since experienced a consistent string of attacks that used malicious code previously used by north korea. south korea s intelligence service reported that some 7.6 billion won ($7 million) worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen in those previous attacks on multiple exchanges, according to south korea s chosun ilbo newspaper. but that amount could now be worth about 90 billion korean won ($82 million), moonbeom park, a researcher at the korea internet and security agency, told reuters. malicious code used in attacks over the summer was  virtually identical  to previous attacks connected to north korea, he said. the attacks this year began by targeting the companies themselves, stealing customers  personal information, including names and email addresses, park said. some of those customers were then targeted with so called spearphishing emails   infected emails designed to look as if they were from south korea s taxation agency, the korean national tax service, he said. other researchers said the attackers had impersonated other official bodies. the emails told the recipient that the agency was about to conduct a tax investigation of the user.  an attached document, however, was a korean language file infected with a  trojan horse  program that would exploit a vulnerability in the hanword korean language word processing software to allow the hackers to remotely control the user s computer, park said. from there, the attackers would access the user s bitcoin wallet either on the computer, or on the bitcoin exchange s server, he said. other researchers said the exchanges were also attacked using fake email accounts. cristiana brafman kittner, principal analyst at the cybersecurity firm fireeye, said she could not confirm whether north korea had actually stolen any virtual currencies, but said hackers linked to it had targeted  multiple exchanges  over the past six to nine months.  we believe that some of the criminal activity we are observing originating from north korea is a result of the regime looking for alternative sources of revenue,  she said.  north korean cyber threat actors present an immediate risk to the financial services sector worldwide.

" somali authorities have handed over to ethiopia a senior official of the onlf rebel group, which is fighting for the secession of ogaden from ethiopia, the group said. abdikarin sheikh muse, an executive committee member who lived in the somali capital mogadishu, was detained by security in galkayo in somalia s semi autonomous galmudug state on august 23, the onlf said in a statement. quoting sources close to the somali cabinet, it said the somali government had  forcefully  handed over abdikarin sheikh muse to ethiopia without his consent in violation of u.n. convention relating to the status of refugees. ethiopian officials were not available for comment.  the ogaden national liberation front (onlf) launched its bid for secession of the somali region, also known as ogaden, in eastern ethiopia in 1984. in 2007, ethiopian forces waged a large scale offensive against them after the group attacked a chinese run oil facility, killing 74 people. analysts say the rebels have since been severely weakened but are still able to launch hit and run attacks. the region they operate may contain 4 trillion cubic feet of gas and major oil deposits, mining experts say. china s gcl poly petroleum investments signed a production sharing deal with the government in late 2013 to develop two gas fields.

" u.s. senator john mccain said on thursday that president barack obama was “directly responsible” for attacks on americans like the one in florida because of policies that contributed to the rise of the islamic state. but the arizona republican later  said he misspoke. mccain, who is in a tough re election race, made the comments after reporters chased him down a marble stairway and into a hallway of the u.s. capitol. they asked what he was hearing from constituents about gun control issues being debated in the senate after sunday’s shooting rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to islamic state militants. “i’m hearing a lot from my constituents about what happened and of course i am making them realize that barack obama is directly responsible for it,” mccain said. “because when he pulled everybody out of iraq, al qaeda went to syria, became isis, and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama’s failures, utter failures,” mccain said. “so the responsibility for it lies with president barack obama and his failed policies.” after media reports began to appear about his comments, mccain, who lost the white house to obama in the 2008 presidential election, posted a clarification on twitter and then issued a statement that said he meant to blame obama’s policies, not the president personally. “i misspoke. i did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible. i was referring to president obama’s national security decisions, not the president himself,” mccain said in the statement. forty nine people died in the shooting in orlando, the worst mass shooting in modern u.s. history. the gunman was u.s. born omar mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from afghanistan. mccain, 79, faces multiple opponents in a republican primary race in august, and some analysts say he is in danger of losing the senate seat he has held for three decades. earlier this week, presumptive republican presidential candidate donald trump appeared to suggest obama may have been complicit in the orlando attacks. “look, we’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he’s got something else in mind,” trump told fox news. “and the something else in mind — you know, people can’t believe it ... there’s something going on. it’s inconceivable. there’s something going on.” ",0

" emmanuel macron, who at the age of 39 has brought youth and vigor to the french presidency, is also developing a reputation for stinging and sometimes off message language.  during a visit to a struggling company in the south west of france on wednesday, macron was caught on video discussing clashes outside between the police and workers protesting his economic policies.  instead of kicking up a bloody mess, some of them would be better off going to see if they can get a job over there,  he said, referring to a nearby aluminum factory battling to find workers.  some of them have got the qualifications to do it,  he said, adding:  it s not that far for them to go.  the comments lit up tv channels and twitter, where they were relished by the far left and far right, who are keen to cast macron, a former investment banker, as out of touch with the common man and a president for the rich.  florian philippot, until recently the number two in the far right national front party, described macron as having  contempt  for france s lower income workers. a similar accusation was leveled by clementine autain, a lawmaker from the far left france unbowed party.   it shows a great class contempt,  she said.  he can t stop coming out with unfair comments targeting the masses.   macron s new spokesman, former journalist bruno roger petit, was quick to post the full video of macron s exchange on twitter, saying some outlets and opponents were circulating extracts that made the president sound worse than was the case.  truncated and taken out of context,  he said of snippets on social media.  emmanuel macron was underlining that the search for solutions on jobs is everyone s responsibility.  it is not the first time macron has sparked controversy with his language and then shown little sign of contrition.  while his often erudite speeches are laced with literary references that show off his elite education, he has a tendency to use dismissive words in off the cuff comments that critics say make him sound arrogant. last month, as he was finalizing changes to france s labor rules to make hiring and firing easier, he said he would not bow to  slackers  who resist reform. in july, visiting a high tech start up center in paris, he talked about  those who succeed and those who are nothing .  and in 2016, when confronted by angry unionists while he was economy minister, macron was recorded saying:  you don t scare me with your t shirt. the best way of paying for a suit is to work.  spikey language has dogged french presidents in the past. nicolas sarkozy caused uproar while interior minister in 2005 when he branded youths behind the worst urban violence in france in decades as  scum , a comment that haunted him as president. and francois hollande was accused by his former partner of referring to the poor as  toothless , undermining his efforts to portray himself as a friend of the needy.

" british singer adele made clear on monday that she has not given permission for anyone to use her music for political campaigns. adele’s spokesman issued a statement after republican u.s. presidential contender donald trump played adele’s 2011 hit song “rolling in the deep” at rallies in iowa, and mike huckabee released a youtube parody last week of her 2015 single “hello.” “adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning,” the singer’s spokesman said in an email. the spokesman did not say whether adele, whose new album “25” was the biggest seller in the united states last year, was contemplating legal steps to prevent the unauthorized use of her music. adele is far from the only pop or rock star to have seen politicians co opt their music for political purposes. rock band r.e.m. lashed out in september at trump for using its hit song, “it’s the end of the world” at a rally, and frankie sullivan complained about the use of the band’s 1982 hit “eye of the tiger,” at a news conference in september featuring kim davis, a county clerk in kentucky briefly jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses.

" the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, named for former democratic lawmakers senator chris dodd and representative barney frank, was signed by former president barack obama in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis. dodd frank is the most sweeping financial regulatory statute enacted since the response to the great depression in the 1930s. it created new regulatory bodies and directed already existing agencies to write hundreds of regulations aimed at creating stability in the financial markets. republican lawmakers, including president donald trump, have said that dodd frank is burdensome for financial institutions, and many seek to repeal it in whole or part. trump signed an executive order on friday that did not mention dodd frank by name. but white house press secretary sean spicer told reporters on friday, “dodd frank is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets” and the order would be the first step taken to review the law. here are some of the dodd frank law’s main provisions: the financial stability oversight council dodd frank created the fsoc to monitor risk in the financial system and it was granted the power to deem institutions, including non bank firms such as asset managers and insurance companies “systemically important financial institutions.” these firms are often called “too big to fail” and subject to additional capital requirements. the office of financial research dodd frank created the independent office of financial research within the treasury department to provide data and support related to risks in the financial system to relevant government agencies, including the fsoc. this data is used in part to assess whether a firm is a systemically important financial institution. consumer financial protection board dodd frank created the cfpb, a federal agency that oversees consumer protection in the financial sector, including banks, payday lenders, credit unions, mortgage servicers and other companies. a federal appeals court ruled in october that the bureau’s structure is unconstitutional because its director, currently richard cordray, cannot be removed by the president without cause. that ruling was stayed and has not taken effect pending appeal. volcker rule a portion of dodd frank known named for former federal reserve chairman paul volcker prohibits commercial banks from also engaging in proprietary trading and restricts them from investing in hedge and private equity funds. the volcker rule also limits the liabilities that can be taken on by the country’s largest banks. the rule was delayed several times and took effect in july 2015. some large wall street banks asked the federal reserve to grant them an additional five year grace period to comply with the rule. capital requirements the law’s so called capital requirements forced banks to fund themselves more by raising money from shareholders than by borrowing. regulators used a variety of requirements to force banks to cut their reliance on debt, including by imposing tougher rules for riskier assets. the most stringent requirements fell on the biggest banks. banks say the process has been costly.  living wills dodd frank required banks with assets of $50 billion or more to submit living wills to regulators. a bank’s living will is a kind of prepackaged bankruptcy plan that will guide its dissolution and liquidation without taxpayer assistance should it collapse. if these living wills are deemed insufficient by regulators, institutions get another chance to submit a new plan. at that point, if regulators again deem a living will insufficient, a bank can face sanctions.    swaps push out rule the initial swaps proposal prohibited banks active in swaps markets from receiving federal assistance. the rule was narrowed to apply to only swaps entities. a swaps entity is a swap dealer that is registered with the commodity futures trading commission or securities and exchange commission. the rule does not apply to depository banks that have swaps divisions, which remain eligible to be insured by the federal government. regulated institutions a number of dodd frank’s provisions were designed to direct agencies to regulate entities such as private equity funds and hedge funds for the first time. it also required a brand new regulatory regime for over the counter derivatives, which imposed capital and margin requirements, central clearing and trading transparency rules on the marketplace.

" a top israeli diplomat was rebuked by prime minister benjamin netanyahu on thursday for suggesting that american jews have a poor commitment to service in the u.s. military. asked in an english language television interview about criticism of israeli policies by some u.s. jews, deputy foreign minister tzipi hotovely questioned whether  people that never send their children to fight for their country  could understand the  complexity  of the middle east.  most of the jews don t have children serving as soldiers, going to the marines, going to afghanistan or to iraq,  she said on i24 tv news on wednesday.  they don t feel how it feels to be attacked by rockets, and i think part of it is to actually experience what israel is dealing with on a daily basis,  said hotovely, a member of netanyahu s right wing likud party. while israel has often quarreled with american jews over their right to advise it from afar, hotovely s remarks went further by appearing to insinuate they are not fully committed to their native country, a notion u.s. jewish organizations have long fought against in their battle against anti semitism. in a statement, netanyahu, who also serves as israel s foreign minister, denounced hotovely s comments as  hurtful .  there is no place for such a harangue and her remarks do not reflect the state of israel s position,  the statement said. according to a 2009 survey published by the congressionally mandated military leadership diversity commission, an estimated 1.09 percent of the members of the u.s. armed forces are jewish. the pew research center estimated in 2013 that jews make up about 2 percent of the u.s. adult population. the website of the national museum of american jewish military history in washington lists more than 50 jewish service members killed in iraq and afghanistan since 2001.

" japan s shinzo abe was re elected prime minister on wednesday after his ruling bloc s big election win last month and days ahead of a visit by u.s. president donald trump that is expected to be dominated by concerns over a volatile north korea. abe, 63, took office in december 2012, promising to reboot the stale economy and bolster defense. his liberal democratic party led coalition retained its two thirds  super majority  in parliament s lower house in the oct. 22 election, reenergizing his push to revise the post war, pacifist constitution. abe was expected to reappoint current cabinet ministers and tell them to compile an extra budget for the year to march 31, 2018 focusing on child care and boosting productivity. in a telephone conversation on monday, abe and trump agreed to work together on steps to counter pyongyang s nuclear and missile development.  trump told abe  he is looking forward to his visit to japan, that japan and america are 100 percent together and there is no room to doubt the japan u.s. alliance,  japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary yasutoshi nishimura told reporters. the two leaders have developed a close personal relationship since trump was elected, and plan to play golf together during trump s nov. 5 7 visit to japan.

" christian militiamen killed a mauritanian u.n. peacekeeper in an attack on a camp for displaced people in a central african republic diamond mining town on monday, the united nations mission there said. fighters armed with ak 47s and makeshift weapons also wounded one zambian and two mauritanian peacekeepers during the 90 minute gunfight at the police checkpoint in the town of bria, the u.n. added. the country has been riven by sectarian conflict since 2013 when muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize. that triggered a backlash by christian anti balaka fighters. as many as 100 people died in bria in june during a day of clashes between rival factions. the area is coveted by militia for its surrounding diamond mines. it also hosts tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict. even with 13,000 troops, the u.n. mission has struggled to restore order to a country the size of france and has lost 14 peacekeepers in attacks this year alone.

" supporters of former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders on saturday expressed anger and vindication over leaked comments made by hillary clinton to banks and big business that appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to wall street. clinton, who needs sanders’ coalition of young and left leaning voters to propel her to the presidency, pushes for open trade and open borders in one of the speeches, and takes a conciliatory approach to wall street, both positions she later backed away from in an effort to capture the popular appeal of sanders’ attacks on trade deals and powerful banks.  the excerpts of remarks by the former secretary of state, made in 2013 and 2014 in closed door meetings where audiences paid to attend, were published online on friday by wikileaks, which sourced them to the email account of john podesta, clinton’s campaign chairman.  reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the speech transcripts. clinton has previously declined to release any such transcripts. “this is a very clear illustration of why there is a fundamental lack of trust from progressives for hillary clinton,” said tobita chow, chair of the people’s lobby in chicago, which endorsed sanders in the primary election. “the progressive movement needs to make a call to secretary clinton to clarify where she stands really on these issues and that’s got to involve very clear renunciations of the positions that are revealed in these transcripts,” chow said. the revelations were quickly overshadowed by the release of an 11 year old recording of donald trump, the republican presidential nominee, making lewd comments about women.  clinton has worked hard to build trust with so called progressives, adopting several of sanders’ positions after she bested him in the primary race. the u.s. senator from vermont now supports his former rival in the nov. 8 general election against trump. still, clinton has struggled to win support from young “millennials” who were crucial to sanders’ success, and some democrats expressed concern that the leaks would discourage those supporters from showing up to vote.  “that is a big concern and this certainly doesn’t help,” said larry cohen, chair of the board of our revolution, a progressive organization formed in the wake of sanders’ bid for the presidency, which aims to keep pushing the former candidate’s ideas at a grassroots level. “it matters in terms of turnout, energy, volunteering, all those things.” the clinton campaign said it would not confirm the accuracy of the documents released by wikileaks and its founder, julian assange.  “we are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by julian assange, who has made no secret of his desire to damage hillary clinton,” said glen caplin, a campaign spokesman.  “guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated russian misinformation campaign,” he said, referring to the hacker or hacking group that altered some data stolen from the democratic national committee before making it public earlier this year.  the u.s. government on friday formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the election. the origin of the leaks did not dampen social media criticism of the speeches by some. “bernie was right about hillary,” wrote facebook user grace tilly, “she’s a tool for wall street.” “clinton is the politicians’ politician   exactly the wall street insider bernie described,” wrote facebook user brian leach. spokesmen for sanders did not respond to requests for comment. nbc news quoted a statement from sanders saying he would work to advance the democrats’ policy platform. “whatever secretary clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on wall street, i am determined to implement the agenda of the democratic party platform which was agreed to by her campaign,” the statement said. democratic strategist steve elmendorf said progressive voters would still choose the former first lady, even with misgivings. “i’d like to meet the bernie sanders supporter who is going to say, ‘well i’m a little worried about her on international trade, so i’m going to vote for donald trump’,” he said.

" a senior u.s. senate republican warned his party on thursday against simultaneously overhauling medicare and the obamacare health insurance program, saying this would be “biting off more than you can chew.” the cautionary comments from senator lamar alexander came after house speaker paul ryan, long an advocate of privatize  medicare, said republican lawmakers would be discussing reforms of the health insurance program for the elderly with president elect donald trump’s administration. republicans won the white house as well as keeping their majorities in both houses of congress in elections last month, and are now busy preparing an agenda for next year after the new congress is sworn in on jan. 3 and trump takes office jan. 20. “well, of course it’s up to the speaker and senator (mitch) mcconnell (the majority leader) what our agenda is, but my advice to them would be, save medicare for another day,” alexander, chairman of the senate’s health, education, labor and pensions committee, told reporters in a capitol hallway. medicare serves more than 50 million americans who are elderly or disabled. more than one third of them are in medicare advantage plans run by private insurers like unitedhealth group inc. the balance receive medical benefits directly from medicare on a traditional fee for service basis. the government has been trying to cut spending on the program, which rises each year with the cost of medical services and drugs.  “we want to begin immediately to repeal obamacare,” alexander said. “trying to deal with the solvency issues in medicare at the same time falls into the category of biting off more than you can chew ... a little humility here would be in order, we can’t do everything at once and we shouldn’t try.” ryan earlier thursday said that medicare was on a path to going bankrupt around 2028, and needed reform, a repeat of his long standing stance. he wants to convert the fee for service program into a system of subsidies for seniors, to buy coverage from private insurers or a scaled back medicare. democrats including senator chuck schumer have seized on the fact that trump’s nominee to head the health and human services department   representative tom price   supports major changes to medicare, to warn republicans against privatizing the program.  alexander also said that while republicans will move quickly to repeal obamacare, the repeal probably would not take effect for two or three years, during which time lawmakers can work on a replacement plan.

" u.s. lawmakers introduced legislation on thursday seeking to stop at least a portion of president donald trump’s sale of weapons to saudi arabia. republican rand paul and democrats chris murphy and al franken introduced a resolution of disapproval in the senate to force a vote on whether to block part of the sale. the senate foreign relations committee received formal notice of the pending sale on may 19. the arms export control act of 1976 allows a senator to force a vote on an arms sale, once congress is formally notified of plans to go ahead. the same three senators introduced a similar resolution last year seeking to block the sale of $1.15 billion of tanks and other equipment to saudi arabia. that measure was defeated overwhelmingly. saudi arabia was the first stop on trump’s first international trip this week, and he marked the visit by announcing the arms deal in riyadh on may 20. saudi arabia agreed to by $110 billion of u.s. arms, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. the lawmakers aim to block about $500 million of the sale, the portion including precision guided munitions and other offensive weapons. “given saudi arabia’s past support of terror, poor human rights record, and questionable tactics in its war in yemen, congress must carefully consider and thoroughly debate if selling them billions of dollars of arms is in our best national security interest at this time,” paul said in a statement. members of the u.s. house of representatives also took action on the planned sale on thursday. republican representative ted yoho and democrat ted lieu wrote to the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee asking for a hearing to review the sale of precision guided munitions to riyadh. democratic president barack obama’s administration suspended the planned sale of precision guided munitions in december because of concerns over the saudi led military campaign in yemen and civilian casualties. but trump has said he wants to encourage international weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the united states.

" u.s. president donald trump named on tuesday two possible candidates to run the federal reserve over the next few years: current fed chair janet yellen and trump’s economic adviser gary cohn, according to an interview with the wall street journal.  yellen, whose four year term expires in february, “is in the running, absolutely,” to be renominated, trump was quoted as saying. in addition, cohn, a former goldman sachs president who is now director of the national economic council, “certainly would be in the mix,” he said. trump said he probably would make the announcement at the end of the year, the paper reported. he was also quoted saying that there are ""two or three"" other contenders, though he declined to name them. on.wsj.com/2h0hctb any fed nominee would need senate confirmation. trump’s comments could sharpen speculation over who will take the helm of the world’s most influential central bank, which is leading a global shift toward tighter monetary policy. earlier this month, politico reported that yellen was increasingly unlikely to serve another term, while cohn was the top candidate. cohn, a democrat who is managing the white house’s search for candidates, did not work on trump’s campaign and only got to know him after the november election. “i’ve gained great respect for gary working with him,” the paper quoted trump as saying on tuesday.  yellen took over from ben bernanke as fed chair in february 2014 with the u.s. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground. as unemployment has since fallen, she has overseen four interest rate hikes and aims for at least one more before the end of this year.  “i like her. i like her demeanor. i think she’s done a good job,” trump was quoted as saying. “i’d like to see rates stay low. she’s historically been a low interest rate person.”  during last year’s presidential election campaign, trump had accused the fed of keeping rates low to help president barack obama, saying the fed had created a “false economy” and that rates should change. in an april interview with the wall street journal, trump did not rule out a second term for yellen.

" russia is working on defensive measures to prepare for possible new sanctions from the united states and other countries, the kremlin said on wednesday. u.s. president donald trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in august drafted by u.s. lawmakers. one of the provisions asked the u.s. treasury secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover russian sovereign debt, with an outcome expected as early as february. u.s. and eu sanctions imposed over russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea, and its support for pro russian separatists in eastern ukraine, remain in place. but u.s. allegations that moscow interfered in last year s u.s. presidential election, something russia denies, have spurred calls for more sanctions.   on wednesday, the kremlin was asked to comment on media reports that russian state development bank veb planned to transfer its globex bank to the state and about speculation that the bank would then be used to service the military industrial complex to try to protect russia from new sanctions.  we are working on and taking measures aimed at defending our interests against a backdrop of possible new restrictive actions and sanctions by various countries, which we continue to deem unlawful,  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters. he did not mention globex bank.  it would probably not be right now to make public or disclose all these measures aimed at hedging our risks,  peskov said.

" the head of the chicago public schools (cps) said on tuesday that illinois governor bruce rauner’s fiscal 2017 school funding budget would hurt the financially ailing district. projected per district funding levels released by the illinois state board of education on tuesday indicate cps would receive nearly $893 million in the fiscal year that begins july 1, a drop of $74.4 million from the current fiscal year. “it makes our already grave fiscal crisis graver,” cps ceo forrest claypool told reporters. “that’s why his budget must be defeated.” he added that state funding for the nation’s third largest public school system was cut by $106 million in fiscal 2016. cps is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit caused largely by escalating pension payments. the district, which has credit ratings in the “junk” level, has been dependent on borrowing to generate cash flow.   the republican governor in february proposed boosting per student funding in k 12 public schools to $6,119, the highest level in seven years. however, some districts like cps would have a decrease in general state aid based on lower enrollment and other factors. claypool said illinois needs to replace its “radically discriminatory education funding formula,” claiming it short changes chicago’s poor and minority children. he called a new funding plan unveiled by senate democrats last week “a step in the right direction,” but not a complete fix. legislation unveiled by democratic senator andy manar is aimed at providing more funding to high need, high poverty schools. claypool said he was also encouraged by democratic house speaker michael madigan’s proposed amendment to the illinois constitution that would make public education a fundamental right, while giving the state the “preponderant” responsibility for funding schools.

" venezuela s socialist government gifted chocolates to creditors on monday, but offered no firm proposals at a brief meeting in caracas that left investors without a clear understanding of the government s strategy to renegotiate $60 billion in debt. president nicolas maduro confused investors this month with a vow to continue paying venezuela s crippling debt, while also seeking to restructure and refinance it. both restructuring and refinancing appear out of the question, however, due to u.s. sanctions against the crisis stricken nation. a default would compound venezuela s dire economic crisis. monday s short and confused meeting, attended by senior venezuelan officials blacklisted by the united states, gave no clarity on how maduro would carry out his plan, bondholders and their representatives who participated said afterwards. that means venezuela remains with the dilemma of whether to continuing paying debt at the expense of an increasingly hungry and sick population, or defaulting on creditors and burning its bridges to the global financial system.  there was no offer, no terms, no strategy, nothing,  said one bondholder, leaving the meeting that lasted a little over half an hour at the  white palace , departing with a colorful gift bag containing venezuelan chocolates and coffee.  but bond prices maintained last week s rally, with one investor saying there was relief the meeting did not include a default announcement. nearly $300 million in late interest payments on three bonds   pdvsa 2027, venezuela 2019 and venezuela 2024   was also due on monday after 30 day grace periods ended. but bondholders appeared unconcerned at the delay, which was due in part to increased bank vigilance of venezuela transactions.   my expectation is that the coupon payments will come through as well,  said jan dehn, head of research at ashmore investment management.  we know that these delays exist and why they exist.    about 100 investors, including some bondholders from new york and lawyers representing creditors, entered the  white palace  via a red carpet and were greeted by a poster of maduro s predecessor hugo chavez at the entrance of the meeting room inside. chief debt negotiators vice president tareck el aissami and economy minister simon zerpa   on u.s. sanctions lists for drug and corruption charges respectively   attended the meeting for half an hour. they met with some bondholders, while others stayed out of the room on concerns about penalties for dealing with officials sanctioned by washington. el aissami told creditors that deutsche bank may soon cut off some financial services to venezuela, participants said. deutsche declined to comment. he read a statement protesting unfair treatment by global financial institutions, including u.s. president donald trump s sanctions aimed at preventing venezuela from issuing new debt.  now maduro can say:  i showed goodwill, the bondholders showed goodwill ... but unfortunately because uncle sam is not playing ball we can t (refinance) ,  said dehn, who did not attend the meeting.  i m not hugely surprised nothing s come out of that meeting.  separately, the european union approved economic sanctions and an arms embargo on venezuela on monday, although it has yet to name who will be subject to the sanctions. markets continue to remain optimistic that venezuela will service its debts, noting it has made close to $2 billion in payments in the past two weeks, albeit delayed.  bond prices were up across the board on monday, with the benchmark 2022 notes issued by state oil firm pdvsa [pdvsa.ul] rising 3.3 percentage points.  the economic implosion has already taken a brutal toll on venezuelans. citizens are suffering from malnutrition and preventable diseases because they cannot find food and medicine or cannot afford them because of triple digit inflation.  the sight of poor venezuelans eating from garbage bags has become a powerful symbol of decay. it contrasts sharply with the era of chavez, when high oil prices helped fuel state spending. halting debt service would free up an additional $1.6 billion in hard currency by the end of the year. those resources could be used to improve supplies of staple goods as maduro heads into a presidential election expected for 2018. but the strategy could backfire if met with aggressive lawsuits. a default by pdvsa, which issued about half of the country s outstanding bonds, could ensnare the company s foreign assets such as refineries in legal battles   potentially crimping export revenue.

" when bill mcanulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white north carolina county, agreed in july to open a sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow republicans. “i became a villain, quite frankly,” recalled mcanulty at a state board of elections meeting in september that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans. “i got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the republican party,” mcanulty said. following the blowback from republicans, mcanulty later withdrew his support for the sunday site. in an interview with reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the sunday voting site in randolph county because he had “made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters.” he declined to discuss the episode further. this year’s highly charged presidential contest between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in north carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections. in emails, state and county republican officials lobbied  members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings – times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by democratic voters. reuters obtained the emails through a public records request. the officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on oct. 20 and ends on saturday. civil rights advocates and democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours.  the tug of war yielded mixed results. the state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. but several counties  opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016. “we currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under democrat control,” said north carolina republican party executive director dallas woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the democratic vote. president barack obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in north carolina on wednesday. “those who wanted to suppress the vote, they’re going to fail,” he said at the university of north carolina chapel hill in chapel hill. “right now, there are more one stop early vote sites in north carolina than ever before.”  counties that obama, a democrat, won in 2012 increased their sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his republican rival, mitt romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show. state republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or “off hour” times, drains county resources. in two emails, on aug. 11 and aug. 14, woodhouse urged republicans serving on county election boards to follow the “party line” on curtailing the early voting period.  “many of our folks are angry and opposed to sunday voting,” he wrote. “six days of voting in one week is enough. period.” keeping polling sites open for the full 17 day early voting period “may be wasteful and unnecessary,” he added.  woodhouse’s emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the reuters review of public records shows. the review counted similar emails from at least four other republican party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two republicans and one democrat. the same day that woodhouse sent his aug. 11 email, elaine hewitt, a member of the rowan county republican executive committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on sundays.  “with all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person monday   saturday, and on election day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on sundays,” she wrote.  garry terry, the chairman of the republican party for north carolina’s first congressional district, sent an email on aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act “in the best interest of the republican party” by opposing sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location. hewitt and terry did not respond to requests for comment. woodhouse defended the actions of the republican officials, telling reuters that republican opposition to sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on sundays. the sunday polling site that mcanulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the randolph county board of elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director. “if it’s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,” margaret megerian, the democratic member of board, told reuters. in contrast with the republicans’ email campaign, the democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums. in democratic leaning guilford county, the state’s third largest, a county board of elections meeting on aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012. the rev. nelson johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board’s republican chairwoman would “prevent voting especially by people who can’t easily take time off” and said it “absolutely” had a racial intent. johnson, who is african american, leads a community center in greensboro, north carolina. board chairwoman kathryn lindley told reuters she believed “a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,” and that it was “ludicrous” to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory. the board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of sunday voting before the november election. johnson said the decision was “a significant triumph.” lindley said johnson’s group had no influence on the final outcome. guilford’s plan also included one restriction that particularly angered democrats. in the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. this year, that has been reduced to one.  mary cranford, 52, a registered republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in guilford. she was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. she said she voted for clinton this year.  “i can’t believe what’s been done to keep some people from voting in this state,” she said. just 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records. the general counsel for clinton’s campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on oct. 1 demanding guilford and four other north carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities. the court denied it, saying that changing the early voting plans “would create logistical difficulties.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump s revised hardline policy towards iran will have little impact on tehran s ambition to develop its vital oil industry and attract foreign investment, a senior iranian official said on tuesday. the islamic republic hopes to signs 10 new deals with foreign companies to develop oil and gas fields by march 2018, amir zamaninia, iran s deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, told the oil & money conference in london. trump s decision last friday not to certify that iran was complying with last year s international deal on its nuclear power development program will not detract from tehran s plans, he said.  i don t think any of us, or any of our partners have been surprised by this statement. our expectations of policy formulation from washington have been very measured,  he said.  the (u.s.) statement and policy ... has little or no effect and implication on our future plan in the oil industry,  zamaninia said. iran is negotiating 28 contracts with foreign companies, including many of europe s top oil companies, under a new development contract, he added. france s total (totf.pa) became in july the first western oil major to re enter iran following the lifting of international sanctions with an agreement to develop the giant south pars offshore gas field. total s chief executive officer said in an interview with international oil daily the company will wait to see the impact of trump s decision and that it will try to continue with it if the united states imposes unilateral sanctions.  we have signed a contract in iran. if we can move forward, we ll move forward. if we cannot, we will have to stop,  patrick pouyanne said. royal dutch shell (rdsa.l) has also signed an agreement with iran for the possible development of oil and gas fields. iran, which holds the world s largest gas reserves, plans to boost its gas production to 1.1 billion cubic meters per day by 2021 from the current 800 million bcm per day, zamaninia said.  the opec member also aims to raise its oil production capacity to 4.7 million barrels per day by 2021 from the current 3.8 million bpd, he said. he said that the major oilfields   azadegan, yadavaran, abteymour and mansouri   have potential to increase output by 2 million bpd combined.

" a former north carolina staffer is suing donald trump’s presidential campaign, saying a top employee in the state working on the republican’s white house bid once pulled a gun on him and that after he reported it, the campaign took no action. vincent bordini, who said he was hired in december 2015 as a software trainer, said earl phillip, then trump’s north carolina state director, pointed a pistol at his kneecap while the two were in a car together in february, according to a lawsuit dated wednesday and filed in state court. bordini said he reported the incident to several trump campaign officials, including then campaign manager corey lewandowski, with no result, according to the lawsuit, which was posted online by the new york daily news. the lawsuit names phillip and the trump campaign as defendants. “vincent was a passionate donald j. trump supporter,” the lawsuit said. “he had faith that the trump campaign would handle the situation internally. but as time went on it became apparent  that this not going to happen.” william harding, a charlotte based lawyer for phillip, called the allegations “preposterous” and said if bordini’s claims were true, there would have been criminal action. “if someone brandished a weapon on me or assaults me, i’m going to go to the appropriate law enforcement officer,” harding said. phillip was replaced earlier this month as state director and moved to a diversity coalition for trump. on thursday, he resigned from the campaign, harding said. the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. an attorney for bordini also did not immediately respond. the lawsuit said the gun incident occurred during a trip to south carolina ahead of that state’s primary. bordini said four other people had similar interactions with phillip, but the campaign did nothing in response, the lawsuit said.

" democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s probability of winning the white house got a modest bump in online betting markets on tuesday, a day after her debate with republican donald trump. the price for a contract favoring clinton on the popular predictit betting market was up 2 cents from monday’s post debate closing and implied a 68 percent probability that she would win the nov. 8 election.  although during the debate clinton was as high as 70 percent, her monday night closing of 66 matched the highest closing number since her health took a stumble on sept. 11. a pro trump contract on tuesday indicated his probability for victory was 34 percent. trading in both contracts remained brisk on the heels of the first of three debates. predictit contracts are priced from 0 to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability a candidate will win the election. initially, the price swings for both candidates were the largest since early august, though a substantial portion of clinton’s gain and trump’s fall had been retraced by early afternoon on tuesday. the swing following the debate put the brakes on a big trump price rally on predictit that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. on predictit, the implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 percent heading into the debate from 28 percent at the end of august.  clinton’s prospects also showed comparable improvement on betting sites based in ireland and the united kingdom. uk based betfair called the debate for clinton based on odds movements on its platform, where more than 3 million pounds were bet during the event.  the implied probability of a clinton win in november climbed to 69 percent on betfair, the strongest it has been since her prospects took a hit over her pneumonia diagnosis this month. trump’s probability fell to 30 percent from 37 percent. on ireland’s paddypower, clinton’s odds also had shortened, or improved, to 2 to 5 from 1 to 2 in the early moments of monday’s debate. trump’s odds, which initially lengthened following the debate, had shortened modestly to 2 to 1.

" the philippines  congress lower house agreed on wednesday to restore the commission on human rights  annual budget, which had been slashed to just $20 after lawmakers allied to president rodrigo duterte accused it of only investigating government abuses. the head of the house appropriations panel, karlo nograles, said the chr has promised lawmakers to expand its role by looking into rights violations by criminals and rebel groups. the 294 member congress will still have to confirm the restoration of chr s 678 million pesos ($13 million) budget for 2018 in the third and final reading of the appropriations bill next week, nograles said in a statement. nograles, a close ally and relative of duterte, said the decision to restore the budget and that of two other agencies was made after a  frank but cordial  meeting between house speaker pantaleon alvarez and chr head chito gascon.   the duterte government is not the enemy. we are one with the chr in the fight against all forms of human rights violation but they must start looking also at the violations committed by criminals and insurgents,  he added. duterte has faced crticism from human rights groups for his war on drugs in which more than 3,800 people have been killed in police operations in the past 15 months. police reject allegations that they are executing suspected users and dealers.

" donald trump’s transition team on monday pushed back against an effort to recount nov. 8’s presidential election votes, calling the effort “nonsense,” but offering no evidence to back a weekend trump tweet alleging millions of illegal votes. with the clock winding down for voters and candidates to seek recounts in states across the country, green party presidential nominee jill stein requested a recount in pennsylvania on monday just hours before the state’s deadline. filing in pennsylvania three days after she filed a similar request in wisconsin, stein’s campaign said she would file a similar request in michigan by its deadline on wednesday. following trump’s stunning victory in the presidential contest, talk of recounts has swirled, with the republican president elect adding a surprise twist to the discussion. on sunday, trump tweeted that “serious voter fraud” occurred in california, new hampshire, and virginia, states won by his opponent, democrat hillary clinton. all three states rejected trump’s claim. the white house said on monday there has been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest. still, wisconsin officials on monday prepared to launch a recount of the state’s more than 25 million votes, following stein’s request last week, a move that was joined by clinton’s lawyers. “if nothing else, this will give us a very good audit,” mark thomsen, the chair of the wisconsin elections commission, said on monday. “it’s going to reassure wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that we’re not counting illegal votes.”  a statement on the wisconsin elections commission’s website said the recount was scheduled to begin on thursday and had to be completed by dec. 13. stein’s campaign has raised the money needed to pay filing fees for recount requests in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania. but she still aims to raise $800,000 more to cover fees for attorneys and other personnel needed to oversee the recount, said an official with her campaign. the official said any funds left over would be disbursed according to federal elections commission guidelines. california voters still could request recounts there. but the deadline for requesting a recount in new hampshire has already passed and the margin of victory in virginia was larger than what is necessary for a recount to occur, according to election officials in those states. new hampshire’s deputy secretary of state, david scanlan, said there was no evidence supporting trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud. “voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances,” he said. california secretary of state alex padilla called trump’s allegations unsubstantiated and virginia commissioner of elections edgardo cortes said they were unfounded.

" brazil s new top federal prosecutor on tuesday reshuffled the team of investigators in charge of pursuing the biggest corruption probe yet conducted in latin america s largest nation. prosecutor general raquel dodge, who took over the post on monday after the end of her predecessor rodrigo janot s term, had previously invited all the members of janot s team of prosecutors working on the  car wash  corruption probe to stay.  however, few expressed interest in continuing, and dodge, 56, who holds a master s degree from harvard and has spent three decades working as a federal prosecutor, decided to replace the entire team with her own choices. just a few of the previous prosecutors will stay on for a month to help with the transition.  the  car wash  investigation, which began in early 2014, has led to an unprecedented fight against entrenched political corruption in brazil.  it has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid by major construction firms to politicians and executives at state run enterprises such petroleo brasileiro in return for lucrative contracts. it is one of several major investigations taking place in brazil, probes that have led to the conviction of former president luiz inacio lula da silva, and charges being leveled against president michel temer, his predecessor dilma rousseff, and two more former presidents.  charges have been lodged or investigations opened against dozens of federal lawmakers, while over 100 powerful businessmen and politicians have been convicted.  while there was a clear personal rift between janot and dodge, whose appointment by temer was ratified by the senate in august, that does not necessarily mean federal prosecutors will be any less aggressive in pursuing corruption.  obviously there will be a change in style, but there will be no change in the course of investigations,  said carlos pereira, a professor of public policy at the getulio vargas foundation and one of brazil s top experts on corruption.  but the team chosen by (dodge) is extremely professional and has already shown skills in fighting corruption.   among the prosecutors who will be part of dodge s car wash investigation team are veterans from brazil s first major probe into political corruption, the 2005  mensalao  scandal.  it ended with top members of lula s government being found guilty of paying off lawmakers in return for their support of lula s legislation.

" despite president donald trump s full throated support for saudi arabia, the united states appears to be signaling a desire for riyadh to take a more cautious approach in its regional power struggle with iran, experts say. the trump administration, which shares saudi arabia s view of iran as a regional menace, has strongly backed the kingdom in the wake of a failed missile attack from iran aligned forces in yemeni territory that demonstrated an ability to strike the saudi capital. trump has cultivated much warmer ties with the saudis after a fraught relationship with the obama administration   the president made riyadh his first stop on his maiden international trip   and has vowed to take strong action to confront iran. nevertheless, washington, which has u.s. forces in syria and iraq, is telegraphing a more tempered stance toward the confrontation in a region beset with turmoil.  on thursday, the state department called for  unimpeded access  for humanitarian aid to yemen, after saudi arabia imposed a blockade on the country to stem the flow of arms to iran aligned houthi fighters.  a day later, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson made clear he still recognized as lebanon s prime minister saad al hariri, who unexpectedly announced his resignation on nov. 4 from riyadh. in announcing his decision on television, hariri said he feared assassination and accused iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world, thrusting lebanon into the front line of the competition between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran.  two u.s. officials said the saudis, led by crown prince mohammed, had  encouraged  hariri to leave office and lebanese officials say he is being held in saudi arabia, a charge riyadh denies. hariri has not commented publicly on whether he is free to come and go as he pleases. in a statement on saturday, the white house said it  rejects any efforts by militias within lebanon or by any foreign forces to threaten lebanon s stability...or use lebanon as a base from which to threaten others in the region.  when asked to comment on whether the united states was pushing for a more cautious saudi response, both the white house and state department referred to saturday s statement on lebanon. tillerson was  not going along with the saudi position in describing the lebanese state as under capture by hezbollah,   said paul salem, the senior vice president of the middle east institute, a washington think tank.  that s significant.   tillerson was also  signaling to the israelis ... that now is not the time to go after lebanon,  said salem, referring to long standing israeli concerns about hezbollah s growing military prowess. ray takeyh, a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations, said he believed the trump administration was still seeking to help the saudis advance their interests against iran without destabilizing the region.  this is a delicate balancing act. it involves supporting allies in a policy that the administration agrees with, while trying to mitigate aspects of it that it (sees as) overstated,  takeyh said. tillerson s statement also urged  all parties both within lebanon and outside  to respect lebanon s independence and said there was no role for any foreign forces. the united states regularly criticizes iran and hezbollah for their role in lebanon. tillerson s backing of hariri and the lebanese government contrasted sharply with the approach taken by saudi arabia, which has lumped lebanon with hezbollah as parties hostile to it.  i see rex tillerson as being an old fashioned american diplomat and old fashioned american diplomacy in the middle east is all about stability,  said f. gregory gause, chairman of the international affairs department at texas a&m university.  i m not entirely sure that that is the position of the chief executive of the united states,  gause added. the saudi actions coincide with an anti corruption purge by the country s future king that tightened his grip on power. trump tweeted on monday that he had  great confidence in king salman and the crown prince of saudi arabia  following the mass arrests   the biggest such purge of the kingdom s affluent elite in its modern history. trump also tweeted that  they know exactly what they are doing.   former and current u.s. officials with deep knowledge of saudi arabia say trump s enthusiastic support for prince mohammed has emboldened the youthful saudi leader. tillerson told reporters the purge appeared  well intended  but the mass arrests, which have swept up officials long known in washington, also fueled u.s. concerns.  it raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with,  tillerson added. trump s son in law, jared kushner, the president s senior adviser, who has cultivated a close relationship with prince mohammed, recently returned from saudi arabia, fueling speculation on whether he may have had wind of the crown prince s plans. a senior administration official said they had no advance knowledge.

" the obama administration and cuba continue to sign cooperation agreements this week, scrambling to complete negotiations on a range of issues with just days to go until donald trump is sworn in as u.s. president, potentially bringing a chill to relations.  an agreement to cooperate on air and maritime search and rescue in the florida straits was signed on wednesday in havana, and another setting territorial limits in contested gulf of mexico waters was scheduled for signing on wednesday or thursday, according to diplomatic sources.  a third agreement on health protocols for dealing with issues such as bird flu was scheduled for signing on wednesday, but postponed for later this week. it would be the last of 22 accords that have been concluded in the last 18 months. seeking to reverse more than 50 years of u.s. efforts to force communist run cuba to change by isolating it, democratic president barack obama agreed with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to work to normalize relations. since then the two countries have restored diplomatic relations and obama has taken a number of steps to increase travel and trade with cuba. trump, a republican who will be sworn in on friday, has threatened to end the detente if cuba does not make further political and other concessions, although he has not specified what these should be. the prospect of a fresh chill has prompted both governments to wrap up negotiations on five agreements since the november election, including one on fighting international crime and another on preventing and containing oil spills.  the obama administration last week ended a 21 year old special arrangement by which all cubans arriving in the united states, including without visas, were entitled to stay and seek residency. the policy had long been criticized by the cuban government.  john kavulich, president of the u.s. cuba trade and economic council which has followed business ties between the two countries for two decades, noted that while there had been a large array of recent agreements and memorandums of understanding, not all were binding treaties. “the commercial, economic and political bilateral relationship between the united states and cuba remains tentative, fragile, and immensely subject to the impact of winds from the north and winds from the south,” kavulich said. the trump transition team has included five cuban americans who are vocal opponents of detente and who have close ties to cuban american lawmakers calling for a return to efforts to isolate cuba. a number of trump appointees, including his  national security advisor, michael flynn, have expressed opposition to the effort to normalize relations. obama has used executive orders, which can be scrapped by trump, to circumvent the longstanding u.s. trade embargo on cuba and ease some restrictions on travel and business. the embargo can be lifted only by the u.s. congress, which is controlled by republicans.

" a united states congress decision on the iran nuclear deal could clarify washington s stance on the international accord and lead to a positive outcome for total (totf.pa) and its planned $5 billion iranian gas project, its ceo said on wednesday. congress has two months to decide whether to reinstate sanctions on iran after u.s. president donald trump last week refused to formally certify that tehran was complying with the nuclear agreement hailed by his predecessor barack obama as key to stopping iran from building nuclear weapons. the deal was also signed by china, france, russia, britain, germany and the european union. total was the first western oil major to sign a deal with iran to develop phase 11 of iran s south pars, the world s largest gas field. a decision to reinstate sanctions on iran could jeopardize the project. pouyanne has said total would withdraw from iran if obliged by law.   there is an ongoing process in the united states. congress has to make a decision. what is good with this process is that there is going to be a clarification of the position of the united states,  pouyanne told journalists on the sidelines of an oil conference in paris.  who knows, perhaps it could be a clarification that would be positive. i don t think there is a majority in the u.s. senate that wants to abolish the deal.

" former two term illinois governor rod blagojevich is seeking a drastically reduced sentence that would see him released from federal prison within a year after convictions in 2011 for corruption charges including extortion and wire fraud, according to u.s. court documents. federal prosecutors countered, recommending in documents filed just before a midnight tuesday deadline that blagojevich serve out his original 14 year sentence, of which he has served more than four years. the motions come ahead of a scheduled resentencing on aug. 9 before u.s. district judge james zagel after an appellate court last year vacated five of blagojevich’s 18 criminal convictions. prosecutors declined to retry the ex governor on the vacated convictions. blagojevich, a democrat, was the first illinois governor to be removed from office and has been in federal prison in colorado since 2012. the former governor was convicted on charges including seeking money in exchange for an appointment to the senate seat formerly held by president barack obama. his attorneys argued in u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois that the flamboyant former u.s. house representative has made efforts toward restitution, tutoring fellow prison inmates and playing in a band with a since released inmate called the jailhouse rockers. they said that blagojevich’s release from prison early would allow him to repair his relationship with his wife and two daughters. “a sentence in the neighborhood of five years incarceration accompanied by a period of supervised release would be sufficient,” blagojevich attorney leonard goodman said in a filing. u.s. prosecutors argued that blagojevich should serve out the entire sentence as he still does not take responsibility for his illegal actions. “(blagojevich’s) continued insistence that he lacked intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted further demonstrates a complete lack of acceptance,” they said.

"republican national committee (rnc) chairman reince priebus reacted to fbi director james comey s letter on sunday informing congress the agency will not change its previous decision to not recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton in the e-mail probe.priebus released the following statement reminding voters the fbi continues to investigate the clinton foundation: the fbi s findings from its criminal investigation of hillary clinton s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. the fbi found evidence clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the american people about her reckless conduct. none of this changes the fact that the fbi continues to investigate the clinton foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. hillary clinton should never be president. last week, fox news cited two sources with intimate knowledge of the fbi s investigations as saying the agency s probes into the clinton foundation continue to be a  very high priority  among local agents on the ground.fox news further reported:agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people on the foundation case, which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between then-secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation. the fbi s white collar crime division is handling the investigation.there is a split, however, between local investigators and fbi headquarters, as well as with the justice department.here is the full text of comey s letter on sunday informing lawmakers of the fbi s decision to not alter the agency s conclusion reached last july that it will not recommend charges against clinton in the email case:i write to supplement my october 28, 2016 letter that notified you the fbi would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former secretary of state clinton s use of a personal email server.since my letter, the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.during that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state.based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton.i am very grateful to the professionals at the fbi for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.  breitbart news",1
" israel was upbeat about u.s. president donald trump s anticipated announcement on friday of major steps against the international nuclear deal with iran, but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by washington could turn around tehran. while the white house s distaste for the 2015 pact may be sweet to the ears of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, his government is mindful of the limits of any unilateral u.s. action in the face of dissent from other big power signatories. some israeli officials quietly question whether washington has the will to follow through, noting what they deem insufficient u.s. efforts to stem the entrenchment in next door syria of iran allied forces helping damascus in the civil war. trump was expected to say in a 1645 gmt speech that he will not re certify the nuclear agreement in light of iran s ballistic missile projects and involvement in regional trouble spots. that would give the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran that were suspended in return for it rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb making potential.  netanyahu spokesmen declined to comment on the pending speech. a veteran israeli cabinet minister from netanyahu s likud party sounded cheered by trump s resolve, but appeared to note the depth of partisan rifts around the u.s. administration.   the outcome that could happen, and this is the only positive outcome we can see at this stage, is that congress manages to come together around new, significant sanctions,  the minister, tzachi hanegbi, told tel aviv radio station 102 fm.  (that) will confront a lot of gigantic international companies which are today streaming to the iranians ... with a dilemma of having to choose between the iranians and trading with the world s biggest economy, which is the united states.  netanyahu has lobbied hard against the iran deal, delivering a speech in congress shortly before it was signed that angered then u.s. president barack obama. addressing the u.n. general assembly last month, netanyahu urged world powers that negotiated the deal to  fix it or nix it.  he called specifically for cancelling a core  sunset clause  that removes caps on iran s nuclear projects after a number of years.  asked about the sunset clause in the radio interview, hanegbi gave no indication israel believed it would be reviewed. he noted the resistance that trump s new measures faced from european powers, russia and iran, which has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the u.s. imposes new sanctions against it. iran, hanegbi assessed,  will not yield at all   period   in other words, not just not within 60 days, but neither within 60 months or 60 years, because they really do not believe that the world will reverse course. they look rather mockingly at the united states.   but he added,  if the united states reverses course and begins a process of building delegitimation for the agreement, it could be that the world, part of the west, will join it in a process that could take time ... there is still a long way to go until the dangers of this deal pass.  israel is believed to have the middle east s only nuclear arsenal with about 200 warheads and sees iran s nuclear activity as a threat to its existence. it refuses to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons. there has been dissent within israel over the nuclear deal, with several netanyahu ex advisers grudgingly coming out in its favor. his former defense minister, ehud barak, told the new york times on wednesday:  like many israelis, i think the iran deal is a bad deal. but it is a done deal.  barak warned that any u.s. withdrawal from the agreement would not be followed by other world powers and could prompt iran   which denies seeking nuclear weapons   to work on a bomb. hanegbi dismissed such predictions as  nonsense .   iran has no interest in withdrawing from the agreement (because that) would immediately unite russia and china to the united states  against it, he told the radio station. he noted   as have u.n. nuclear inspectors   that the iranians  have not budged a hair s breadth from their commitments under the deal .

" the obama administration announced a broad expansion on tuesday of a program to let people fleeing violence in el salvador, guatemala and honduras enter the united states as refugees, and said costa rica agreed to temporarily shelter some of those with no other recourse. under the plan, costa rica will host up to 200 applicants at a time deemed too vulnerable to remain in their homelands while the u.s. department of homeland security evaluates them for possible resettlement, which could take up to six months. the united states will also expand a program for child refugees and allow some people to apply for refugee status in their home countries. the steps, after months of criticism of president barack obama’s handling of the crisis, are modest in comparison to plans announced by secretary of state john kerry in january to open several refugee processing centers in the region. “our current efforts to date have been insufficient to address the number of people who may have legitimate refugee claims,” amy pope, deputy homeland security adviser at obama’s national security council, told a telephone briefing for reporters. many details, including how the program would be financed or how many people might be eligible, were unavailable. advocates said they were pleased the administration was  moving to provide the migrants, especially children, with an alternative to staying home with their lives at risk or relying on smugglers for the dangerous journey through mexico. “it’s really the way the program should have been established from the start, but even belatedly we’re happy to see that this is the direction that they’re taking it,” said bill frelick, director of the refugee rights program at human rights watch. since october, nearly 80,000 children and families from the three countries have been apprehended at the u.s. border with mexico. the crisis has fueled heated debate on the campaign trail over whether to welcome migrants fleeing violence or build a wall to keep them out, a centerpiece of republican donald trump’s run for president. republican representative bob goodlatte, chairman of the house of representatives judiciary committee, called the plan an abuse of the law. “today’s expansion of the obama administration’s policy is simply a continuation of the government sanctioned border surge,” he said in a statement. the program also met resistance in the region. guatemalan government officials rejected the description of those seeking to leave the country as refugees. the administration also will expand its central american minors program, which allows those under 21 with a parent in the united states legally to seek refugee status. the program will now allow siblings, care givers or another parent to do so. only 267 minors have entered the united states since the program began in december 2014. deputy secretary of the department of homeland security alejandro mayorkas said 2,880 applicants have been approved and are awaiting resettlement. the new york times reported in january that the united states planned to admit up to 9,000 central american refugees. costa rican minister of the presidency sergio alfaro told a news conference in san jose the government reserved the “explicit right” to ask for more information if there were doubts about those granted the six month humanitarian visas. carlos maldonado of the u.n. refugee agency (unhcr) said the unhcr and international organization for migration would handle costs incurred as applicants were processed in costa rica. if approved, they would most likely head to the united states, but could go to canada, sweden, argentina, brazil, chile or uruguay. convincing countries to host a center has been difficult amid concern slow processing would lead to a backlog of people with nowhere to go, u.s. sources said. nearly 8,000 cubans migrating to the united states were stuck in costa rica recently when neighboring nicaragua closed its border. costa rica’s location is also a challenge. salvadorans, hondurans and guatemalans seeking to move to the united states must travel south, across nicaragua, to get there.

" the protests in major u.s. cities against republican donald trump’s surprise presidential election victory have been impromptu affairs, quickly organized by young americans with a diverse array of backgrounds and agendas. but as they look out at the next four years with trump in the white house while his party controls both houses of congress, activists are starting to prepare for what they hope will be the nation’s strongest protests since the occupy wall street movement. rallies scheduled for saturday in new york and los angeles, and a protest planned for washington on jan. 20, when the new york businessman succeeds president barack obama, will be just the beginning, activists said in a series of interviews. the rev. al sharpton, a civil rights leader from new york, said anti trump protesters should borrow a page from the playbook that republicans used to oppose obama’s policies. that movement started organically, later developed as the tea party movement and eventually resulted in the election of trump, said sharpton, whose national action network plans to launch a new organizing effort at its new york headquarters on saturday. “we are not going to be as ugly as them, but we are going to be just as persistent,” sharpton said. “this is not going away.”  sizable protests sprung up this week in about a dozen major u.s. cities, including boston, baltimore and san francisco. demonstrations in portland, oregon, and berkeley, california, turned violent, with protesters setting fires and clashing with police. trump initially dismissed the crowds on twitter, calling them “professional protesters, incited by the media,” but later reversed course, saying he admired their “passion.” t.j. wells, who had volunteered to work for democrat hillary clinton’s failed presidential campaign, said his decision to organize a thursday night protest at washington’s trump international hotel near the white house was spontaneous. “i literally shared it with a few friends, and within a few hours i had a couple hundred people show up,” said wells, who is 27 and lives in the washington suburb of bethesda, maryland, where he works in human resources. he said he hoped it would be the first of many such demonstrations. “from inauguration day to the time he’s out of office, we have to make sure that if there’s something he’s going to pass that the majority of americans who voted for hillary clinton are not ok with, that we are forceful about that,” wells said. some 59.5 million people voted for trump, fewer than the 59.7 million who cast ballots for clinton, but trump’s strong showing in swing states, including michigan, earned him a decisive victory in the electoral college that ultimately picks the president. opponents have cited trump’s history as a leader of the “birther” movement that claimed wrongly that obama had not been born in the united states, his promises to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and his calls to register muslims. members of the answer coalition, a broad based u.s. protest group, have marched in this week’s protests and aim to draw tens of thousands to an anti trump inauguration day rally, said walter smolarek, an organizer. “the people are going to fight back against the trump agenda from day one,” smolarek said. he said the group planned to continue to protest throughout trump’s four year term. since his victory on tuesday, trump has taken a more measured public tone than he had during the campaign. that has some civil rights advocates ready to wait and see what trump does before joining in protests. “i don’t think that donald trump responds very well to protests, to be honest with you,” said brent wilkes, national executive director of the league of united latin american citizens.  he said he was willing to see whether trump would be more moderate in his actions than he had been in the campaign, adding: “if he doesn’t, we’ll be out there in the streets.” ",0
" australia’s center left opposition labor party leader bill shorten on tuesday endorsed u.s. democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton over her chief republican rival, donald trump, who he said would be “very difficult” to work with. shorten, who is campaigning against prime minister malcolm turnbull ahead of national elections on july 2, pledged to continue australia’s close relationship with the united states regardless of the outcome of the u.s. election. but he made no secret of which candidate he preferred. “in terms of hillary clinton or donald trump, i have to say that if i was in america, i would be voting for hillary clinton,” shorten told reporters. “whoever america elects we’ll deal with but there’s no doubt in my mind that trump would be very difficult, i think, to deal with.” trump’s often controversial comments on everything from muslims and women to the future of nato and relations with russia have drawn criticism from berlin, paris and other european capitals. british prime minister david cameron this week stood by his description of trump’s plan to ban muslims from entering the united states as “divisive, stupid and wrong” after trump said that he was unlikely to have a good relationship with cameron.

" a u.s. senate panel approved measures on thursday that were causing concern in europe among negotiators hammering out a new trans atlantic pact on electronic data transfer, an issue for many companies such as facebook and microsoft. in a step toward addressing global concerns about data privacy, the senate judiciary committee approved legislation, headed next to the full senate for a vote, that would give some europeans the right to sue in the united states over allegations of electronic data privacy violations. but amendments were added at the last minute that raised questions from the european union in brussels. that is where negotiators are working on a broad “safe harbor” agreement, which faces a deadline next week, that will protect the free transfer between the united states and europe of data such as web searches and social media updates. a previous safe harbor pact was ruled invalid by a top european union court in october 2015 amid concerns in europe about u.s. internet surveillance. the senate’s judicial redress act, approved by the committee, is not seen as crucial to securing the new safe harbor pact, but european privacy regulators have been clamoring for passage of the act as a sign of good faith. “that is a very, very important signal of trust and reliability,” european commission director for fundamental rights paul nemitz told reuters at a conference in brussels. complicating this gesture were two amendments, pushed by republican senator john cornyn of texas and adopted unanimously. one would limit the ability to sue in u.s. courts to citizens of countries already in an international data deal with the united states, such as safe harbor. another would require the u.s. attorney general to certify that participating countries do not have policies impeding u.s. national security. eu authorities have given safe harbor negotiators until the end of january to strike a new deal. several sources familiar with the talks said negotiators have made progress in the past week, but hurdles remain. u.s. federal trade commissioner julie brill said on thursday in brussels that reaching agreement would require the european commission to consider the changes the united states has made to its national security laws in recent years. under the eu charter, individual member states retain powers over national security, which in practice means brussels is unable to negotiate with washington on such issues, the moderator of the conference panel noted.

" british foreign secretary boris johnson said on tuesday that his remarks about a jailed aid worker in iran could have been clearer, after opponents said his comments might provoke the islamic republic to hand the dual national a longer jail term. as prime minister theresa may heads toward a 2019 eu divorce that will shape britain s prosperity and global influence for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk undermining her remaining authority. in the latest misstep, johnson came under pressure to retract remarks made on nov. 1 that iranian british aid worker nazanin zaghari ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in april 2016. zaghari ratcliffe s employer, the thomson reuters foundation, said johnson s comment was incorrect, while opposition british lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail. johnson called iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif on tuesday to discuss the case, and made clear that he had been seeking to make the point that he condemned the iranian view that training journalists was a crime, a spokesman said.  the uk government has no doubt that she was on holiday in iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit,  johnson told parliament.  my point was that i disagreed with the iranian view that training journalists was a crime, not that i wanted to lend any credence to iranian allegations that mrs zaghari ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity,  he said.  i accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and i am glad to provide this clarification.  johnson said he would travel to iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there, and would try to meet zaghari ratcliffe while there. may s spokesman expressed confidence in johnson, adding that the  he was doing a good job . monique villa, thomson reuters foundation ceo, said zaghari ratcliffe was a project manager in the media development team. villa said zaghari ratcliffe was not a journalist and had never trained journalists in iran.  we welcome uk foreign secretary boris johnson s clarification of his comments,  villa said.  it s time now for the foreign secretary to meet nazanin in jail.   johnson is not the only one distracted. at the weekend, may s deputy, damian green, denied an allegation made in the sunday times newspaper that police found pornography on one of his computers in the houses of parliament in 2008. on monday, international development minister priti patel apologized for failing to disclose meetings with senior israeli officials during a private holiday. besides her government s sometimes contradictory signals on brexit, may has faced criticism from opponents for her handling of other issues: from a deadly apartment block fire in june to a sexual harassment scandal in parliament that prompted michael fallon, her loyal defense secretary, to resign.  in my lifetime, i have never experienced a british government which seems to be so shambolic,  said simon hix, a professor of political science at the london school of economics.  they are in the midst of one of the greatest challenges of the last 50 years   brexit   and they have sexual harassment scandals in parliament, the paradise papers and then now on top of that the behavior of may s ministers.  on tuesday, johnson came under pressure from opponents to retract his comments about zaghari ratcliffe, who is serving a five year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment. she was brought again into court on saturday, three days after johnson s remarks, and accused by a judge of  spreading propaganda against the regime . the british foreign office quoted zarif as saying that johnson s comments had nothing to do with the weekend court appearance. the charges against zaghari ratcliffe were denied by her family and the foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of reuters news.  by suggesting nazanin was in iran  teaching people journalism , boris johnson has endangered the cause to secure her release,  tulip siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition labour party, said.

" representative ryan zinke of montana, president elect donald trump’s nominee for secretary of interior, on tuesday said he would consider an expansion of energy drilling and mining on federal lands but would ensure sensitive areas remain protected. the former navy seal sought to outline a measured approach to the job of managing america’s national parks, forests and tribal lands during a four hour senate confirmation hearing that was mostly cordial, lacking some of the hot tempered grilling that has marked other sessions to vet trump’s cabinet nominees. “yes,” he said in response to a question from republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska about whether he would review drilling curbs imposed by president barack obama’s administration in her state, home to vast petroleum deposits both onshore and beneath arctic waters. “i can guarantee you it is better to produce energy domestically under reasonable regulation than overseas with no regulation ... we need an economy.” but he added he was committed to protecting sensitive wildlife habitats and to keeping federal lands under federal control to ensure they are preserved for future generations, so “my granddaughter’s children can look back and say that we did it right.” the interior department oversees territories covering a fifth of the united states’ surface from the arctic to the gulf of mexico, including rich deposits of oil, gas and coal and important pasturelands for ranchers. zinke, an avid hunter and angler, emerged as a surprise pick to head the department in part because he has embraced federal stewardship of public land, diverging from the republican party’s official position to sell off acreage to states. but as a congressman he has also fought for increased energy development, a position that has worried conservationists and which fits neatly with trump’s campaign vows to bolster the u.s. energy sector by scaling back regulation. over the last eight years, the interior department has sought to limit industry access to federal lands and played a key role in obama’s agenda to combat climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emitting industries. under obama, the department banned new coal mining leases on federal property early in 2016. more recently the agency placed parts of the offshore arctic and atlantic off limits to drilling and declared national monuments that protect large parts of utah and nevada from development. zinke said he believed trump could “amend” obama’s moves to declare millions of acres of federal property as national monuments. but he said that any move trump made to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged. he did not comment directly on whether he would seek to reverse obama’s federal coal lease ban but said he believed coal plays an important part in the u.s. energy mix and has previously pushed to end the moratorium. zinke was the first of three cabinet heads trump has chosen to oversee his environment and energy portfolio to face senate scrutiny this week. all three have opposed obama’s measures to combat global climate change by targeting carbon dioxide emissions. trump’s pick to lead the environmental protection agency, oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, was to testify on wednesday, and trump’s choice for energy secretary, former texas governor rick perry, was to testify on thursday. zinke told committee members that he believes humans contribute to global climate change – a statement that appeared to clash with trump’s views. before running for the white house, trump called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the chinese to weaken u.s. businesses, a position he has since defended. “i do not think it is a hoax,” zinke said. but he added that he believed there is still debate over the degree to which humans have an impact, and what should be done about it, adding that regulations could sometimes hurt jobs without helping the environment.  he said, for example, he would support efforts by the u.s. congress to cancel recent regulation imposed by the interior department’s bureau of land management aimed at preventing leaks of methane   another gas scientists blame for climate change   from oil and gas installations. in his opening remarks, zinke struck a moderate tone, saying that he recognizes that some federal lands require strong protection. he also called himself an “unapologetic admirer of teddy roosevelt,” a former republican president who pioneered public land conservation. zinke also said he would tackle a multi billion dollar backlog in maintenance at national parks and promised to ensure greater sovereignty for tribes.",0
" hollywood actor michael douglas, a u.n. “messenger for peace”, wants president barack obama to issue a strong message against nuclear weapons when he visits hiroshima in japan later this month. douglas told reporters at the united nations in geneva, where nuclear negotiations have been stuck for 20 years, that the nuclear danger was greater than during the cold war,  largely due to a “huge escalation” in u.s. russia tensions and increasing recklessness in their close quarter contacts. “there’s this kind of crazy tension between u.s. and russia. we have our issues but i don’t quite see that all of this posturing is helping anybody,” he said. “the number of weapons that are on trigger alert is frightening. so the time for somebody to possibly make a mistake and correct it is very very short.” douglas said he “found religion” in the anti nuclear cause after the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979, within days of the opening of his film the china syndrome, which dealt with an emergency at a nuclear plant.   standing beside joseph cirincione, president of ploughshares fund, a global security organization, douglas recalled obama’s 2009 speech in prague, where the president promised concrete steps to wards a nuclear free world. “i think we could say he’s been a disappointment because there’s not been follow through, and i do hope now for his legacy as he begins to leave office, that he’s going to have something strong to say at hiroshima.” cirincione said obama had made good early progress on nuclear non proliferation, but had made only modest cuts in arsenals and was leaving $1 trillion in new nuclear contracts in the pipeline for his successor. “every single weapon in the nuclear arsenal is now due for replacement or an upgrade. it’s a looming disaster,” he said. douglas, 71, said he was also a friend of donald trump, but he was not confident the united states would make any advances in nuclear disarmament if trump won the presidency.  “i guess one of his strengths, or weaknesses depending how you look at it, is his unpredictability,” he said.

" president donald trump on thursday nominated former national labor relations board member r. alexander acosta to serve as u.s. secretary of labor, one day after trump’s original choice withdrew. acosta is dean of the florida international university college of law in miami and is trump’s first hispanic nominee.  acosta has had a decades long public service career, serving in three presidentially appointed and senate confirmed positions, and is expected to face a smooth confirmation process. “mr. acosta’s nomination is off to a good start because he’s already been confirmed by the senate three times,” said senator lamar alexander, who chairs the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions that will be vetting the nomination. acosta was appointed to the national labor relations board (nlrb) by former republican president george w. bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the justice department’s civil rights division.  he was then appointed to be u.s. attorney for the southern district of florida, where he went after high profile defendants such as jack abramoff and ubs, resulting in the swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax avoidance scheme. acosta also previously served as a law clerk to samuel alito from 1994 to 1995, when the conservative supreme court justice was a judge at the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals. “i thank the president and his staff for their confidence in me and i am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the american worker,” acosta said in a statement. while at the nlrb, acosta signed hundreds of opinions. those familiar with his work describe him as a careful and cautious public servant whose career trajectory suggested he may someday vie for a federal judgeship. because he has already gone through multiple vettings by the u.s. senate, it is unlikely there will be any surprises in his background that could derail his nomination. the choice of acosta, a traditional republican conservative, is seen by some as a sign that trump was forced to give up a more aggressive policy on worker issues. trump’s first labor secretary pick, andrew puzder, the chief executive officer of cke restaurants inc, was outspoken in opposition to issues such as overtime pay, minimum wage hikes and even discussed the superiority of robots over human workers. he removed his name from consideration on wednesday amid concerns he could not garner enough senate votes to be confirmed.  “this is the humbling of donald trump,” said seth harris, a former acting labor secretary during the obama administration, who said puzder would have been a “radical disruptor” but acosta won’t be. acosta has been a staunch defender of the civil rights of muslims who faced a backlash after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the united states. in a 2011 congressional hearing, acosta applauded how the justice department responded to civil rights violations, saying they helped assure muslim americans that “their government would protect their rights.” some progressive groups were already responding negatively to the acosta appointment, with allied progress alleging he had mismanaged the department of justice’s civil rights division when he ran it.  in 2008, an internal justice department report faulted acosta for failing to rein in a staffer who engaged in improper politicized hiring. however, the response to acosta’s nomination from union groups who had staunchly opposed puzder was much more measured on thursday. “unlike andy puzder, alexander acosta’s nomination deserves serious consideration,” said afl cio president richard trumka.  “in one day, we’ve gone from a fast food ceo who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it.” ",0
" the u.n. human rights council voted on friday to extend its investigation into suspected crimes against humanity in burundi, dealing a blow to an attempt by a group of african countries to dial down the level of scrutiny.  burundi had hoped that by promising to cooperate fully with the u.n. human rights office and inviting three experts to the country, the council would drop its commission of inquiry. it appeared to have succeeded on thursday when the council agreed to send the three experts, backing a resolution that also welcomed burundi s decision  to restore full cooperation  with the high commissioner for human rights.  burundi s ambassador, renovat tabu, told the council that after that decision, there was no longer any need to continue the commission of inquiry, as demanded by the european union.  there is a clear will of the eu to instrumentalize the council to politicize human rights,  he said. but the eu, with strong backing from the united states, pressed the case for the commission of inquiry.   just days ago, when burundi finally agreed to engage members of this council in discussions for the first time, the burundian ambassador portrayed a rosy picture of his country, with the clear goal of ending the commission of inquiry, which he repeated again today,  u.s. diplomat jason mack said.   don t be confused by burundi s last minute engagement, which is solely to put an end to ongoing investigations,  he said.  the commission has said there are reasonable grounds to believe crimes against humanity have been committed since april 2015 when president pierre nkurunziza said he would seek a third term in office. the opposition has said he acted unconstitutionally by doing so.  burundian officials at the highest level  should be held accountable for crimes against humanity and a list of suspects has been drawn up, the commission said earlier this month. in a statement following the vote, the commission said it   would like to believe that the burundian authorities will now respond to a renewed request for dialogue . among the 22 countries voting to maintain maximum scrutiny were botswana and burundi s neighbor rwanda, alongside european countries and the united states. other african nations were among the 11  no  votes and 14 abstentions.

" puerto rico would get substantial debt relief and other new aid to help it recover from destruction inflicted by hurricanes irma and maria in september, under legislation unveiled on tuesday by leading liberals in the u.s. senate. senator bernie sanders, an independent, and senator elizabeth warren, a democrat, called for a new “emergency credit facility” of up to $57.2 billion for puerto rico and $5 billion for the virgin islands, according to a summary of the bill. the bill would also extend the deadline for individuals to apply for assistance from the federal emergency management agency. the legislation cannot advance without the support of republicans, who hold a slim majority in the senate. congressional republicans and the trump administration have approved some $51 billion in aid to the u.s. territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands and u.s. states hit by hurricanes and wildfires, with a new round expected to be approved in december. the effort has been criticized as lackluster by many democrats in congress, with large swaths of puerto rico still without power and clean water. puerto rican governor ricardo rossello is seeking more than $94 billion in disaster recovery aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild and bolster the power grid. the legislation would put congress on record in support of relieving puerto rico’s $72 billion debt. the island has a further $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. kenneth mapp, governor of the u.s. virgin islands, said the island had requested $7.5 billion to cover uninsured hurricane related damages to the public sector. the hurricanes devastated the island’s healthcare sector, destroying two already struggling hospitals. mapp also asked for a waiver to use $226 million in unspent medicaid funding provided under obamacare. the island was unable to spend the money because the local government could not provide its share of matching funds. the sanders warren plan would also restore the u.s. minimum wage for certain young workers in puerto rico, open some federal food and nutrition programs to the two territories and improve benefits under the medicare and medicaid health programs. the legislation as well would provide more federal aid for rebuilding puerto rico’s electric grid, with an emphasis on beefing up solar, wind and other “clean” energy capabilities.

" u.s. president donald trump called germany’s trade and spending policies “very bad” on tuesday, intensifying a row between the longtime allies and immediately earning himself the moniker “destroyer of western values” from a leading german politician. as the war of words threatened to spin out of control, merkel and other senior german politicians stressed the importance of germany’s atlantic ties, with foreign minister sigmar gabriel suggesting the spat was just a rough patch. trump took to twitter early in the day in the united states to attack germany, a day after chancellor angela merkel ramped up her doubts about the reliability of washington as an ally. “we have a massive trade deficit with germany, plus they pay far less than they should on nato & military. very bad for u.s. this will change,” trump tweeted. the tit for tat dispute escalated rapidly after trump, at back to back summits last week, criticized major nato allies over their military spending and refused to endorse a global climate change accord. on sunday, merkel showed the gravity of her concern about washington’s dependability under trump when she warned, at an election campaign event in a packed bavarian beer tent   that the times when europe could fully rely on others were “over to a certain extent”. those comments, which caused shock in washington, vented europe’s frustration with trump on climate policy in particular. and while german politicians sided with merkel, foreign minister sigmar gabriel signaled that it was time for cooler heads to prevail. tit for tat, from tent to twitter “the united states are older and bigger than the current conflict,” he said, adding that relations would improve. “it is inappropriate that we are now communicating with each other between a beer tent and twitter,” he said in berlin. merkel had already begun finessing her message on monday, stressing that she was a “convinced trans atlanticist”, a message she repeated after a meeting with visiting indian prime minister narendra modi in berlin. but martin schulz, leader of gabriel’s center left social democrats, was less emollient earlier in the day when he told reporters trump was “the destroyer of all western values”. he added that the u.s. president was undermining the peaceful cooperation of nations based on mutual respect and tolerance. in rome, italian prime minister paolo gentiloni said he agreed with merkel that europe needed to forge its own path. “this takes nothing away from the importance of our trans atlantic ties and our alliance with the united states. but the importance we put on these ties cannot mean that we abandon fundamental principles such as our commitment to fight climate change and in favor of open societies and free trade,” he said.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump on friday announced his team of economic advisers, among whom are a hedge fund manager, a former top steel executive and a former high ranking u.s. government official.  trump said he would deliver a speech on his economic policy plan on monday. here are some facts on the members of his economic team: paulson is best known on wall street for his bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 that netted him and his investors billions of dollars in profits. but paulson’s calls on stocks and the economy have been less accurate lately. his investments have lost some $15 billion in assets in the last five years, leaving his paulson & co inc hedge fund with roughly $13 billion at the end of june. he is known for making contrarian bets and being patient.  he has been one of only a handful of hedge fund managers to have publicly endorsed trump. many others have said privately that they are still on the fence or leaning toward his democratic rival, hillary clinton. feinberg is chief executive officer of cerberus capital management lp, a private equity firm he co founded in 1992.  he headed the investment firm during its failed takeover of automaker chrysler in 2007. the investment firm served as chrysler’s majority owner until the troubled car maker was restructured in a government sponsored bankruptcy in 2009. feinberg had promised to revive the company, according to a new york times profile, but instead lost billions. (here) feinberg has defended his role to try to save the carmaker. he ultimately had to appeal to washington for help.      malpass served under two previous republican administrations, first as a deputy assistant treasury secretary for president ronald reagan and later as a deputy assistant secretary of state for president george h.w. bush.         malpass, in a cnbc interview on friday, called for greater infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts, trade reform, regulatory reform and energy reform, although he gave few specifics. “we need more effective spending and trump wants to do that   to have stronger finances for the country,” he said. malpass has been a vocal critic of the u.s. federal reserve’s monetary policy since the financial crisis, in particular its large bond holdings. malpass, who was also previously chief economist at investment bank bear stearns, now runs encima global llc, an investment consulting firm.      navarro is the only adviser on the list with a doctorate in economics and the only one who has spent most of his life as an academic. he earned his doctorate at harvard university and is now a professor of economics and public policy at the university of california, irvine’s business school. navarro has written nine books, three of them critical about china’s effect on the rest of the world, including “death by china: confronting the dragon – a global call to action.” he thinks the united states should be tougher on trade and intellectual property theft and has proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on chinese imports.     navarro recently wrote in an opinion piece in the los angeles times that trump would crack down on any country “that cheats on its trade deals using practices such as currency manipulation and illegal export subsidies.” (here) lorber is president and ceo of holding company vector group ltd (vgr.n), whose three subsidiaries make cigarettes as well as e cigarettes. vector also operates two real estate subsidiaries: a real estate investment company and a real estate brokerage firm.  a fellow new yorker, trump's campaign has mentioned lorber as one of trump's best friends. (here) the two traveled together to russia in the 1990s, according to news reports. a former partner at goldman sachs group inc who now works in entertainment financing, mnuchin is chairman and ceo of private investment firm dune capital management lp.  trump named mnuchin, who had a long history of political donations to democrats, including to hillary clinton, as his finance chair in may. mnuchin has said he has had a personal and professional relationship with trump for more than 15 years.  dimicco is the former chief executive and executive chairman of steel producer nucor corp (nue.n), one of the biggest u.s. steelmakers. his outspoken push for tougher u.s. trade policies to support domestic manufacturing and his fierce anti china rhetoric have made him one of the most high profile executives in the steel industry. in recent years, he has taken his campaign for new trade rules online and has publicly endorsed trump’s call for a tougher approach on trade.  “you don’t win a trade war with appeasement or more free trade agreements,” dimicco wrote in a july 10 blog post on his website, www.dandimicco.com.  moore is one of the leading conservative economic voices in the united states. he embraces tax cuts as key to economic growth, as well as free trade and immigration reform. moore founded the anti tax advocacy group club for growth, where he served until he left the organization in 2004. he later served as a member of the wall street journal editorial board.      he is currently a fellow at the conservative think tank the heritage foundation, focusing on economic growth.  barrack is a longtime friend of trump and a fellow hotel developer. he is the founder and executive chairman of private equity firm colony capital inc clny.n and is co chairman of the board of trustees of colony starwood homes sfr.n. barrack spoke out in favor of trump at the republican national convention in july, but afterwards his company announced it was dropping out of trump's old post office hotel project in washington, according to a report in the washington post. (here) kowalski has served as the deputy staff director of the republican staff of the senate budget committee and has over 20 years of experience in fiscal policy at the federal, state and local levels of government. he has a master’s degree in public policy from harvard’s kennedy school of government.  beal is the founder and chairman of beal bank as well as affiliated companies including, csg investments, inc, loan acquisition corporation, and clg hedge fund, llc.  calk is the founder, chairman and ceo of federal savings bank, and national bancorp holdings. he is a commissioned army officer and received his mba from northwestern university.  roth is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of vornado realty trust (vno.n), which focuses on real estate investments in new york city and washington, d.c. vornado and trump are partners in an office building in midtown manhattan.

" australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull said he would not call a general election after a citizenship crisis claimed another member of parliament on saturday, leaving his government clinging to power with the support of two independents. australia s constitution bars dual nationals from parliament, and turnbull s centre right coalition government was thrown into disarray last month by a high court ruling that five of them were ineligible to be lawmakers. earlier on saturday, conservative liberal party mp john alexander told reporters in sydney he was no longer certain that he was solely australian, and that meant he had to resign. turnbull will deal with issues such as a no confidence motion when they arise, he told a televised news conference in vietnam s central city of danang, where he is attending a summit of asia pacific leaders.   we have the support of the crossbench on matters of confidence and supply. there is no question of that happening,  turnbull added, ruling out the possibility of a no confidence motion.  his centre right coalition government must rely on the two independents to vote with it to safeguard its position and block the passage of legislation it opposes. turnbull said he expected a dec. 2 by election would return barnaby joyce both to parliament and to his former position as deputy prime minister, thus bolstering the government. he ruled out an early return to australia following alexander s resignation.  it is my obligation that i must resign,  alexander told a news conference.  that s what i will do. i think there is a great need for certainty, to clarify the situation and to do so as expeditiously as possible.  alexander had been waiting for britain s home office to clarify whether he held british citizenship by descent. it is not known whether they responded. he would have to confirm sole australian citizenship before fighting a by election to regain his seat. alexander said he planned to contest the by election which the sydney morning herald said must be announced no later than monday, to allow the minimum 33 day campaign required to hold the poll on december 16. only the two independents now guarantee turnbull s position after the high court ruling expelled three members of the liberal national coalition government from parliament, with a fourth resigning days later, after confirming his dual nationality.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on monday: trump says the united states will be “tweaking” its trade relationship with canada, stopping short of calling for a major realignment in a development likely to please visiting canadian prime minister justin trudeau. trump is evaluating the situation surrounding u.s. national security adviser michael flynn over his russian contacts, trump’s spokesman says, pointedly declining to make a public show of support for the aide. the u.s. senate votes to confirm former banker and hollywood financier steven mnuchin as treasury secretary, installing the trump administration’s point man on tax reform, financial deregulation and economic diplomacy efforts. a u.s. federal judge rejects a justice department request to suspend seattle courtroom proceedings over trump’s temporary travel ban from seven muslim majority countries until an appeals court has fully reviewed it. benjamin netanyahu opposes a palestinian state, a senior israeli cabinet member says, but leaves it unclear whether the prime minister would say that publicly in talks with trump in washington this week. trump says north korea is a “big, big problem” and that he will deal with it “very strongly” after that country said it successfully test fired a new type of ballistic missile. japanese prime minister shinzo abe, fresh from a visit with trump, says the u.s. stance toward north korea is likely to become tougher. china’s foreign ministry is concerned that japan has received continued u.s. backing for its dispute with beijing over islands in the east china sea during a meeting between trump and abe. a congressional tax oversight committee will not seek trump’s tax returns, despite calls from democrats for a review to determine possible business ties to foreign countries including russia, the panel’s republican chairman says. u.s. equity indexes hit record highs, with the benchmark s&p 500’s market value topping $20 trillion as investors bet tax cuts promised by trump will boost the economy.   the kremlin says there is talk of a possible meeting between trump and president vladimir putin before a g20 summit in july, but there is nothing specific on this so far.

"the streets of paris have erupted into inter-migrant strife as north african youths have targeted  rich  chinese migrants amid growing tensions.police in france recorded more than 200 attacks on chinese immigrants last year, mostly from hostile migrant gangs.this comes amid a growing perception that recent migrants from north africa have become  too demanding  and consider themselves  victims  who deserve pity.contrary to this, the long-standing chinese community in paris has gained a reputation for being  hard-working and managing without taxpayer help .in a report from german channel dw, a chinese migrant named woo described how a gang of north african youths attacked him in his home last november.he said that the yobs threatened him and his wife with a knife and smashed his head, after which broke in and stole his valuables.he added:  i am scared. i don t feel safe anymore.   express ukthe violence against  the rich  by african immigrants isn t limited to europe.a female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a tv interview, related how she was screamed at by a somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. they were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one minneapolis resident told kstp tv.  it was a very traumatizing experience. somalis living in minneapolis are almost all sunni muslims, and residents of the lake calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.here s a preview of what it looks like when police are overwhelmed by migrants who come from violent cultures who have no intention of assimilating or following the law:anarchists, immigrants, youths riot in france  set fire to cops car  armed police officer shows amazing restraint",1

" president donald trump vowed on tuesday to cut red tape to speed up approval of infrastructure projects and said his overhaul could top $1 trillion on roads, tunnels and bridges, one of his 2016 election campaign promises.  trump, a real estate businessman before he was elected, did not provide further details on the amount or where the money would come from when he spoke to a white house meeting of 50 chief executives and other business leaders. u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said at the forum that the administration plans to release a legislative package in may. investors have become more skeptical that the plan would  win approval this year in congress, which is controlled by republicans who are traditionally wary of big spending. trump said building a highway can require dozens of approvals and take 10 to 20 years, a process he vowed to speed up. trump said he would not fund projects that cannot be started within 90 days.  the administration wants to improve the electrical grid and water systems, rebuild airports, bridges, roads and potentially hospitals for military veterans and broadband. national economic council director gary cohn told executives that privatizing air traffic control, which the administration proposed in its budget outline in march, “is probably the single most exciting thing we can do.”. cohn, an investment banker with goldman sachs before he became trump’s top economic adviser, said it could help speed flight times and reduce fuel use. cohn said if cities “sell off” or privatize infrastructure assets, the administration could provide financial support. “we’re not on the cutting edge of this,” cohn said. “we’ve got to get a little more comfortable with public private partnerships.” cohn touted an idea of electric car maker tesla inc (tsla.o) ceo elon musk to use tunnels to speed rail transit on the densely populated east coast and also to cut traffic congestion in los angeles. a tesla spokesman declined comment.

" half a year ago, the political stars seemed perfectly aligned for a deep reform of the european union and its euro currency. emmanuel macron had won the french presidency on a promise to relaunch europe. and angela merkel, on track to win a fourth term as german chancellor, looked ready to embrace his bold vision, telling an audience in bavaria that it was time for europe to take its fate into its own hands. following the collapse of german coalition talks, however, the prospects for a meaningful leap forward in european cooperation, driven by newly minted governments in berlin and paris, look dimmer than ever.   political uncertainty has crossed the rhine,  said jean pisani ferry, an economist and academic who helped write macron s election program.  europe has gotten used to having a strong german government with clear positions. that is something we may not have for some time.  germany now faces months of political limbo which will narrow an already tight window for agreeing reforms of euro zone governance and eu defense and asylum policies. should germany be forced to hold new elections, its partners may have to wait until next summer for a government to take form. by then, europe will be entering crunch time in its brexit negotiations with britain, preparing for sensitive discussions on a long term eu budget and gearing up for the election of a new european parliament. euro zone leaders were due to begin a six month discussion on closer integration of their 19 nation currency bloc next month at a special summit in brussels. now that debate seems likely to be delayed and officials say the chances of reaching any conclusions by june 2018, as proposed by european council president donald tusk, are slim.  things will go on hold until there is a formal acting german government,  one euro zone official said.  at this stage i don t see what steps the leaders could take in december or june for deepening euro zone integration when there is a german government without a mandate.  another casualty could be the completion of an eu pact on closer defense cooperation, known as pesco.  berlin and paris had hoped to sign it into law at a regular eu summit next month. now diplomats involved in eu foreign policy say that may be overly ambitious. germany has also been a driving force behind eu efforts to reform its asylum policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. those discussions, pitting countries like italy and greece against poland and hungary, were already bogged down. without a new government in berlin, there is next to no hope of a breakthrough.  we have so many things we need to do urgently that slowing us down is not good for europe as a whole,  frans timmermans, a former dutch foreign minister who is deputy head of the european commission, told cnn.  he played down the risks, however, saying:  it might slow us down a little bit but i don t think it would take europe off course, whatever happens.  perhaps the only pressing issue which will not be significantly affected by the political uncertainty in germany is brexit, where there is a broad political consensus among german parties. that means that merkel, who will remain in place in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is formed, should have sufficient room to maneuver in talks that, in any case, are being led by the european commission and its chief negotiator michel barnier. still, hopes that the two political earthquakes of 2016   britain s decision to leave the eu and the election of u.s. president donald trump   might shock european capitals into bold reforms, once elections in the netherlands, france, germany and austria were out of the way, are fading. even before the liberal free democrats (fdp) walked out of coalition negotiations with merkel s conservatives and the greens in the early hours of monday, doubts were rising about whether she would have the flexibility to meet macron halfway as head of an awkward three way  jamaica  alliance. now that those talks have collapsed, she would appear to have three options: convince the social democrats (spd) to enter another right left  grand coalition ; form a minority government with the greens or the fdp; or take the risk of new elections. so far the spd leadership has shown no signs that it will go back on its pledge to go into opposition. on monday, merkel appeared to rule out a minority government. so unless something changes, a new election could be the only way forward. that would probably not take place before march or april, around the same time that italy is due to hold elections which could also result in a hung parliament. crucially, polls suggest that a new german election would not give merkel more coalition options than she had coming out of the sept. 24 vote. indeed, if voters blamed her conservatives for failing to form a government the first time around, she could emerge even  weaker than she is now. that would be a further blow to german political stability and to macron s european ambitions.

"the controversy surrounding obama s prison reforms continues with the release of more  non-violent  drug dealers. andy mccarthy had this to say about the lawlessness of obama s release of prisoners: in making a mockery of his core constitutional duty to execute the laws faithfully, the broad law-enforcement discretion the constitution vests in the executive branch has been president obama s preferred sleight of hand. in reality,  prosecutorial discretion  is merely a resource-allocation doctrine peculiar to criminal law: a recognition of the obvious fact that enforcement resources are finite; that it is neither possible nor desirable that every penal infraction be prosecuted; and therefore that priorities must be established about which cases should be pursued, which left to state law-enforcement to handle, and which overlooked. the doctrine has never been what the president has turned it into: a license not merely to ignore but to rewrite laws   not just penal laws; any laws   with which he disagrees on policy grounds. he s set a record with the number of releases:president barack obama commuted the prison sentences of 95 people, mainly for non-violent, drug-related offenses, and pardoned two others, the white house said in a statement on friday.obama has made reforms to the us criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non-violent drug crimes one of the top priorities for his remaining year in office.with the move on friday, president obama, who signed the fair sentencing act in 2010, has now granted 184 commutations during his time in office   more than the last five presidents combined.the number of sentences obama commuted friday is more than double the number he granted this summer and it s the third time this year he s given clemency, the washington post reported. i commuted the sentences of 95 men and women who had served their debt to society, another step forward in upholding our ideals of justice and fairness,  obama said.the fair sentencing act reduced the sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses and many of the pardoned offenders would have faced shorter penalties under today s laws.each of the 95 people who received a commutation friday got a personal letter from the president.he wrote:  i believe in your ability to prove the doubters wrong, and change your life for the better.ex-democratic presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter reduced sentences for 90 inmates total.republicans george w bush, his father and ronald reagan commuted sentences for 27 people.",1

" president donald trump’s push to fulfill a campaign promise to replace obamacare, his predecessor’s signature healthcare plan, with the help of a republican controlled congress, could add to u.s. states’ financial strain. that is because a key component of the 2010 law allowed states to expand medicaid, the government health insurance program for low income americans, and collect extra dollars that came with expansion. thirty one states and the district of columbia chose to expand medicaid enrollment through obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act. (graphic   here) while republicans have not agreed to specific plans, one idea gaining traction has been to convert the current system, in which states share the cost of medicaid enrollees with the federal government, into fixed payments, or block grants, sent to the states. trump’s nominee to run the u.s. department of health and human services, u.s. representative tom price, has long advocated such a plan. the kaiser family foundation estimates a repeal of obamacare and a cap on federal medicaid spending, such as through a block grant or a per capita cap, could cut medicaid funding by 41 percent over the next decade. that would likely handicap states’ ability to respond to larger enrollments during recessions.  “it will have clear implications for state budgets,” said robin rudowitz, the washington based associate director at kaiser’s program on medicaid and the uninsured. “states could raise revenue and spend less in other areas, but these are not easy choices to make.” the foundation is a nonprofit focused on health issues. faced with inflexible federal funding, states might also decide to limit medicaid eligibility or freeze new enrollment, reducing the number of people covered. in a letter to congressional leaders on tuesday, the national governors association pleaded with lawmakers not to “shift costs to states.” new jersey, one of many states struggling with ballooning public pension costs and modest revenue growth, expanded medicaid under republican governor chris christie. that state could lose up to $3 billion in federal aid if the affordable care act is repealed and have to spend $1 billion more from its budget, democratic state lawmakers there said this week. medicaid sits at the heart of the federal state fiscal relationship. over $330 billion in federal medicaid dollars flowed to states in fiscal year 2016, accounting for more than half of all federal grants sent to state and local governments and the largest individual program, according to standard & poor’s. in 2015, the federal government paid about 60 percent of total medicaid costs while states paid 40 percent. medicaid enrollment also tends to spike during an economic downturn, just as state revenues are most strained, spurring the federal government to send more money to states. despite calls from trump to republican lawmakers on thursday for swift action on replacing obamacare and on other priorities, changes will likely still take time to work out. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said the agenda would take more than 100 days and said the goal “is to get these laws done in 2017,” without guaranteeing an obamacare replacement would be enacted by the end of december. with so many details still up in the air, public officials are hard pressed to craft budgets that directly respond to their concerns. new york city mayor bill de blasio on tuesday said his next budget would hold a record amount of money in reserve and seek at least $1 billion of savings citywide to compensate for “a huge amount of uncertainty” emanating from washington.     in california, medicaid enrollment jumped from nearly 8 million in 2012 to more than 14 million today, thanks in part to federal healthcare reforms.  in a letter earlier this month to u.s. house majority leader kevin mccarthy, democratic california governor jerry brown pleaded that congress consider reforms that do not burden state budgets. “that would be a very cynical way to prop up the federal budget   and devastating to millions of americans,” brown wrote to the republican congressman from california. however, brown’s proposed budget this month did not include a contingency for a potential repeal of obamacare or the threat of changes to the federal tax code. “until there is a change in policy at the federal level, we will continue to budget under the current rules of the road,” said california finance department spokesman h.d. palmer.

" the trump administration has told agencies within the department of health and human services to avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year’s budget, the washington post reported on saturday. the newspaper said one of the agencies, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, was given a list of seven prohibited words or phrases: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence based” and “science based.” officials at a second agency were also told to use “obamacare” instead of the affordable care act to describe president barack obama’s 2010 healthcare law and to use “exchanges” instead of “marketplaces” in reference to venues where people can buy federally subsidized health insurance, the post reported. the hhs pushed back on the report.  “the assertion that hhs has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process,” spokesman matt lloyd said in a statement.  “hhs will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all americans. hhs also strongly encourages the use of outcome and evidence data in program evaluations and budget decisions,” he said. the newspaper said state department documents also now refer to sex education as “sexual risk avoidance.” a briefing at the second hhs agency relied on a document from the white house office of management and budget, which oversees president donald trump’s annual budget proposal to congress, according to the post.   the post said no explanations were given for the language changes.

" the u.s. government is scrapping rules on telegraphs even though carriers no longer exist, part of the trump administration’s effort to slash regulations, the federal communications commission said on thursday. the last western union telegram in the united states was sent in 2006 and the commission had stopped enforcing the rules in 2013. the last major telegram service worldwide ended in india in 2013. the fcc said in a notice it was removing “outmoded regulations” on telegraphs effective in november to “further our goals of reducing regulatory burdens, eliminating unnecessary rule provisions, and making the agency as efficient and effective as possible.” there are close to 1,000 pages of fcc media regulations alone. at&t inc, originally known as the american telephone and telegraph company, in 2013 lamented the fcc’s failure to formally stop enforcing some telegraph rules. “regulations have a tendency to persist long after they outlived any usefulness and it takes real focus and effort to ultimately remove them from the books even when everyone agrees that it is the common sense thing to do,” the company said. the telegraph was demonstrated in 1838 in new jersey and by the 1860s was widely used in the united states, marking the first communication that traveled faster than a physical message. telegrams were popular in the 1920s in part because they cost less than a long distance phone call. fcc chairman ajit pai said in may he wanted to remove outdated rules, striking irrelevant regulations as “just a matter of good housekeeping” and others that stand “in the way of innovation and investment that would benefit consumers.” also in may, the fcc voted to start a “comprehensive review” of media regulations. the fcc meets next week to vote to end a 1939 requirement that each am, fm, and television broadcast station maintain a main studio located in or near its community of license. the rule was to “ensure that stations would be accessible and responsive to their communities. however, a local main studio is no longer needed to fulfill these purposes,” the fcc said.

"with a growing number of muslim refugees and immigrants living in america who are strict adherents of sharia law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the united states. it is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in america, but getting caught is the hard part a petition from the womens  group equality now reveals that immigration has put the united states on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. a massive influx of immigrants from muslim-populated countries in africa and the middle east has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the u.s. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.the practice is known as female genital mutilation (fgm).the atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:it usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. in its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. a small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. the cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. it is rare for any anesthesia to be used.as the united states continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a first world country.haha dukureh, an fgm-survivor and founder of the activist organization safe hands for girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the united states go through female genital mutilation.   breitbart newsa gwinnett county muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an american prison (on the american taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. an ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the united states on monday.khalid adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.he was deported on monday after serving 10 years in prison.adem was an ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in gwinnett county, georgia in 2006.

" speaking as a folksy physician running for virginia governor, democrat ralph northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight donald trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.  but northam said he will work with the republican president when it is in the state’s interest. the balancing act puts northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as virginia. he is running against ed gillespie, former chairman of the republican national committee.  the nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether republicans should continue to control the u.s. congress and a majority of state governments. after denouncing trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, northam has since dialed back the vitriol. his emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that democrats lost the white house because voters did not hear what the party stood for.     “the northam strategy is talk trump, but don’t just talk trump,” said stephen farnsworth, a professor of political science at the university of mary washington, noting that northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters. most polls show northam narrowly ahead in a contest democrats consider a must win. virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re election due to term limits. former democratic president barack obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in virginia and new jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. without naming trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like northam.   a recent poll showed nearly one in three likely virginia voters were factoring trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the wason center for public policy at christopher newport university. northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of trump. distain for the republican president is why niel manson, a 72 year old retired engineer living near the capital city of richmond, became a democrat nine months ago.  yet the former independent called northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to trump. “there is no benefit in getting in a discussion with trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” manson said. the northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about trump, seeking to draw parallels to gillespie.  northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change. “now ed’s going right along with donald trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.  the strategy works to connect the president to a republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said jennifer duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non partisan cook political report. she said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non presidential years. “this is our first real election to see how these arguments about trump really do impact republican candidates,” duffy said. gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about trump’s impact on the race. the president endorsed gillespie but has not campaigned with him.  vice president mike pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest virginia’s heavily republican coal country. democratic voter erin siraguse, 34, said she based her support for northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in fairfax county in northern virginia. she admires how northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race. “lieutenant governor northam has done a wonderful job of talking about trump without mentioning trump,” she said.

" california governor jerry brown announced on tuesday that state lawmakers had reached an agreement about the state’s 2017 2018  budget.  both houses of the state legislature will likely vote on the new budget on thursday, the constitutional deadline for lawmakers to adopt a budget bill. california’s department of finance had not totaled the final budget numbers as of tuesday morning, according to department spokesperson h.d. palmer. the budget adds $1.8 billion to the state’s rainy day fund, expands access to california’s earned income tax credit and boosts funding for schools and infrastructure repairs, according to the governor’s office. it also sends more money to the nation’s largest public pension fund, california public employees’ retirement system (calpers), to help reduce the fund’s unfunded liability. “this budget keeps california on a sound fiscal path and continues to support struggling families and make investments in our schools,” brown said in a statement on tuesday.  “this budget makes historic investments in healthcare, education, and childcare, and lays down a multi billion dollar investment to start fixing our roads and infrastructure,” said senate president pro tem kevin de león. brown proposed a state budget in january for the new fiscal year and revised his budget up 2.2 percent to $183.4 billion in may.

" the presidents of three central american countries congratulated donald trump on wednesday after his shock victory over rival hillary clinton in a campaign that focused on immigration issues. on twitter, the presidents of panama, costa rica and honduras wrote to congratulate trump, even as they could be affected by his hardline proposals on immigration and trade. “congratulations united states on (your) elections,” wrote juan orlando hernandez, the conservative leader of honduras. “the people decided ... to success between usa/honduras relations.” the government of el salvador welcomed president elect trump, but called for calm among salvadorans in the united states and said it would work to ensure their rights were respected. immigration became a principal issue during the u.s. presidential race, with trump promising to step up deportations and triple the number of border patrol agents to dissuade immigrants from entering the u.s. illegally. the republican president elect has also threatened to keep many immigrants out of the country by building a massive border wall he says mexico will pay for.

" china and vietnam avoided conflict over the south china sea on sunday when chinese president xi jinping met vietnam s general secretary nguyen phu trong, hours after u.s. president donald trump offered to mediate maritime disputes. relations between hanoi and beijing have been particularly strained since july, when china put pressure on vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area in the south china sea. vietnam s state television said the chinese president had told the vietnamese leader he wanted to work with southeast asian nations on a code of conduct in the sea. china s xinhua news agency said china and vietnam had agreed to properly handle maritime issues and strive to maintain peace and stability. reefs and islands in the south china sea are disputed by brunei, indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and taiwan as well as china and vietnam. since philippine president rodrigo duterte has grown closer to china, vietnam has emerged as china s main challenger in the area. china s move to pressure vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area in july brought relations between the communist neighbours to a low. xi and trump both held bilateral meetings with vietnamese officials in the wake of a summit of the asia pacific economic cooperation in the vietnamese city of danang. trump told vietnam s president tran dai quang that he was prepared to mediate between claimants to the south china sea and said china s position was a problem. trump and president quang issued a joint statement underscoring the importance of free and open access to south china sea, and saying parties should halt escalatory action.

" as americans vote for a new president on tuesday, hundreds of thousands of voters in california’s bay area and boulder, colorado, will also decide whether they want levies on sugary drinks, another step toward making soda taxes a norm. three cities in california   san francisco, berkeley and albany   and boulder, colorado, have become the latest battleground in a so called “war on sugar” that centers on sweetened drinks. over 800,000 voters will decide on ballot measures to introduce taxes of 1 or 2 cents per ounce on soft drinks on nov. 9, just weeks after the world health organization (who) advocated that governments should impose these types of levies.  the push for taxes on sugar and sodas has gathered momentum this year, as officials and health advocates seek ways to stem health epidemics of diabetes and obesity. on most ballots, the tax would not apply to diet sodas but does affect some juices, sports drinks and other beverages with added sugar. reducing consumption of sugary drinks is seen as a relatively easy way for people to cut down on added sugars, recommended by groups including the who, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the american heart association. the trend has prompted worry and millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying campaigns from beverage industry giants like pepsico inc and coca cola co that are facing declining sales of their flagship products in markets including the united states.  so far this year, britain and philadelphia decided to introduce levies on soft drinks and countries including south africa have proposed similar measures. this follows a decision by mexico to introduce such a tax in 2014. the broadening of these efforts raises the prospect of establishing them as the norm after numerous previous attempts failed, advocates say. “the more these taxes pass, the more they will be considered in other jurisdictions,” said jim o’hara, health promotion policy director with the center for science in the public interest in washington. both pepsi and coke have are increasing options for less sugary drinks, responding to changing consumer tastes. consumption of carbonated soft drinks hit a 30 year low in the united states last year, as water sales continued their climb, according to beverage digest. the majority of california voters support government measure to reduce consumption of sugary beverages, according to a field poll released in february. in san francisco, a 2014 bid for a similar tax failed to pass a two thirds vote, but is expected by many to succeed this time around, as only a simple majority is required. the votes in the other cities are expected by both advocates and opponents alike to be tighter. fighting for survival, big soda has been outspending advocates of the measure, but not by much. industry spending to oppose the taxes this year in the bay area alone has swelled to around $27 million to $28 million, versus around some $19 million by advocates, according to estimates from both sides. billionaires including michael bloomberg have joined the fray, contributing $15 million to pro tax campaigns in the bay area. the former mayor of new york waged an unsuccessful campaign in the city to cut soda sizes in 2014. opponents say the tax, which would be levied on distributors, is unfairly targeted at drinks makers and could raise food costs beyond just soda. “in effect, this is a grocery tax. it could be spread out on many items” by distributors, said joe arellano, spokesman for the “no grocery tax” campaigns in california’s bay area.  in the california cities, the measures would introduce a penny per ounce tax. in boulder, it would be 2 cents. “there’s no tax we will support to change behavior of consumers. we don’t think they work,” said susan neely, head of the american beverage association. she cited efforts by soda companies like reducing portion sizes. the group is suing to block philadelphia’s tax. she said it was unclear yet if the group would challenge the potential levies in california or colorado. it is unclear how long lasting the impacts of the taxes in places like mexico and berkeley will be, but some early research suggests partial pass through of the taxes from businesses to customers and an impact on per capita consumption.

" civil liberties groups on wednesday said they were filing a series of lawsuits against the u.s. government seeking details on how federal agencies enforced president donald trump’s ban on travelers from seven muslim majority countries. the lawsuits were filed by local chapters of the american civil liberties union against u.s. customs and border protection and the department of homeland security and cover their operations in 14 cities stretching from portland, maine, to san diego. the suits are an attempt to enforce requests filed under the freedom of information act (foia) just days after trump signed his first executive order limiting travel. that jan. 27 order, intended to fulfill a campaign promise to take a tough stance on immigration, first temporarily barred travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. the order, which also temporarily barred refugees, led to a weekend of chaos at u.s. airports with travelers barred from entering the country upon landing while thousands of people turned out to protest the measures. a federal judge ordered a halt to enforcement of that ban and trump followed up in march with a less sweeping order that did not limit travelers from iraq, but which has also been challenged in courts. opponents said the orders violated the u.s. constitution’s prohibitions on religious discrimination, citing trump’s campaign promises to impose a “muslim ban.” the trump administration said the restrictions are legal and are necessary to protect u.s. national security. the suits, filed in federal courts, seek disclosure of how many people have been detained or subjected to additional screening since the first executive order as well as the guidance that was provided to dhs staff about how to enforce the order. “customs and border protection has a long, rich history of ignoring its obligations under the freedom of information act and so these lawsuits are an effort to enforce its obligations,” said zachary heiden, legal director at the aclu of maine, in a phone interview. he noted that the aclu filed its foia requests for information on feb. 2. officials at cbp and dhs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suits. in addition to portland and san diego, the suits cover cbp operations in atlanta, baltimore, boston, chicago, detroit, houston, los angeles, san francisco, seattle, tucson, miami and tampa. one suit filed in florida covers the two cities in that state.

" president elect donald trump told the wall street journal he is considering retaining parts of president barack obama’s healthcare law including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing conditions. the republican businessman during the u.s. presidential campaign called for repealing and replacing the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, and labeled the 2010 law “a disaster.” in an interview published on friday, his first since winning tuesday’s election, trump told the journal a big reason for his shift was his meeting at the white house on thursday with obama, who suggested areas of the affordable care act to preserve. “i told him i will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, i will do that,” trump said. “either obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,” trump told the journal. some republican lawmakers and advisers have recommended keeping those two provisions in place even if they are able to repeal the law in congress, as they have attempted to do for years. the law has enabled millions of americans who previously had no health insurance to obtain coverage, but republicans oppose it and call it a government overreach. other urgent priorities during his first few weeks as president, trump said, would be deregulating financial institutions to allow “banks to lend again,” and securing the u.s. border against drugs and illegal immigrants. asked whether he would pursue a campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate defeated democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, trump told the paper: “it’s not something i’ve given a lot of thought, because i want to solve healthcare, jobs, border control, tax reform.” trump also told the journal he would create jobs through infrastructure projects and improved trade deals, and would preserve american jobs by potentially imposing tariffs on the products of u.s. companies that relocated overseas.

" u.s. president elect donald trump said on thursday night he would nominate retired marine corps general james mattis, known as “mad dog” and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan, to lead the pentagon. “we are going to appoint ‘mad dog’ mattis as our secretary of defense,” trump told a rally in cincinnati. he said the formal announcement would be made on monday. the choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that trump, a republican, intends to steer u.s. foreign policy away from democratic president barack obama’s increased reliance on u.s. allies to fight islamist militants and to help deter russian and chinese aggression in europe and asia. mattis is a revered figure in the marine corps and known for his distrust of iran. the washington post and cnn reported earlier that trump had chosen mattis, but trump spokesman jason miller said earlier on twitter that “no decision has been made yet with regard to secretary of defense.” while the nomination of the 66 year old mattis would likely be popular among u.s. forces, it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle.   because he retired only in 2013, mattis would need the u.s. congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the pentagon. his impressive combat record, however, may deter some senate democrats from trying to block his nomination. trump has described mattis as “a true general’s general.”  the new york real estate magnate famously asserted last year: “i know more about isis than the generals do.” mattis, whose past assignments include leading central command, which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and south asia, is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the u.s. armed forces: fighting wars. in one famous line in 2003 attributed to mattis, the general told marines in iraq: “be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” in a 2016 question and answer session, mattis appeared to be moved by a marine’s question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand, known as a “kill casualty radius.” “once you get to be a high ranking officer, the kill casualty radius is whatever your marines make it, and by the time i got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles,” he said in a video for the marine corps. still, such tough talk has gotten him in hot water. he was once rebuked for saying in 2005 that “it’s fun to shoot some people.”  his talk, however, belies a more thoughtful side. mattis once said the most important 6 inches in a combat zone was “between your ears.” now a fellow at stanford university’s hoover institution, mattis is also a scholar who was praised by then u.s. defense secretary robert gates in 2010 as one of the country’s great strategic thinkers.  mattis reads avidly, frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television.  after meeting mattis on nov. 19, trump described him as a strong, dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone’s face to simulate drowning.  trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding, which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under president barack obama, but bring back “a hell of a lot worse” if elected.  “(mattis) said: ‘i’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with torture.’ and i was very impressed by that answer,” trump told the new york times. the senate armed services committee will consider mattis’ nomination. in a statement on thursday night, its chairman, republican john mccain, called him “one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.”  mattis would be the first former u.s. general to become defense secretary since george c. marshall took the job in 1950. the decision adds to trump’s national security team another pentagon veteran who served during the obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it. officials who knew him before he retired in 2013 said mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed central command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from iran and to win more resources for afghanistan. trump has given the job of national security adviser to michael flynn, a retired three star army general who was pushed out of the top job at the defense intelligence agency in 2014 by obama’s administration.  flynn was fiercely critical of obama during the 2016 campaign, adopting much of trump’s rhetoric. along with flynn and trump’s choice for cia director, u.s. representative mike pompeo, mattis has been critical of the deal to curb iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program, saying the threat from tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about islamic state or al qaeda. “the iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the middle east,” mattis said. speaking about the iranian nuclear deal, mattis said: “hoping that iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible, modern nation is a bridge too far.” if mattis wins senate confirmation, he will work side by side with another marine   general joseph dunford, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.  having two marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite u.s. fighting force. it would also raise questions about how mattis and dunford might divide up tasks.  both dunford and mattis share battlefield experience, including in iraq. in 2003, mattis led the 1st marine division during the u.s. led invasion of iraq. he has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of falluja in 2004, something he feared would hurt morale, but did not. “we just don’t take refuge in self pity or any of that kind of stuff. and so as a result, the marine corps remains a very feared organization in this world. as it should be,” he said.

" u.s. president donald trump is using money donated to his re election campaign and the republican national committee to pay for his lawyers in the probe of alleged russian interference in the u.s. election, two people familiar with the matter told reuters. following reuters exclusive report on tuesday, cnn reported that the republican national committee paid in august more than $230,000 to cover some of trump’s legal fees related to the  probe.  rnc spokesperson cassie smedile confirmed to reuters that trump’s lead lawyer, john dowd, received $100,000 from the rnc and that the rnc also

wednesday. the trump campaign is due for a disclosure on oct. 15. the u.s. federal election commission allows the use of private campaign funds to pay legal bills arising from being a candidate or elected official.  while previous presidential campaigns have used these funds to pay for routine legal matters such as ballot access disputes and compliance requirements, trump would be the first u.s. president in the modern campaign finance era to use such funds to cover the costs of responding to a criminal probe, said election law experts. smedile said the rnc payments to trump’s lawyers were “from a pre existing legal proceedings account and do not reduce by a dime the resources we can put towards our political work.”  it was not clear how trump’s legal costs related to the russia probe would be allocated between the campaign and the rnc, one of the sources said.  dowd declined to say how the president’s legal bills were being paid, adding: “that’s none of your business.”  special counsel robert mueller is looking at possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia in last year’s election, and whether trump may have obstructed justice by firing federal bureau of investigation director james comey, among other actions.  moscow has denied meddling in the u.s. election, and trump has denied any collusion or obstruction. reuters could not determine how large a legal bill trump has incurred to date from his lawyers on the mueller investigation. trump hired his longtime new york lawyer marc kasowitz to head his defense team in may, but kasowitz stepped down in july, with dowd taking over the lead role, according to people familiar with the situation. special white house counsel ty cobb, who is a salaried staff member, is also working on the matter.  the trump campaign has paid law firm jones day almost $4 million, according to campaign filings, mostly for routine campaign legal expenses like ballot access disputes, vendor contracts, human resources and compliance with state and federal laws. it has also responded to russia related inquiries on behalf of the campaign by, for example, providing documents to congress. the reason trump is able to tap into his campaign funds for legal expenses is because for the past decade, presidential candidates have abandoned public financing for their campaigns. instead, they have built networks that collect millions of dollars from private donors, a move that comes with less restrictions on how the money is spent. barack obama in 2008 was the first to eschew public financing for his campaign, and all the major party candidates followed suit in 2012 and 2016, campaign filings show. trump also filed for reelection the day he took office in january, two years earlier than any previous president, ensuring a fund of millions in campaign cash would remain at his disposal. according to its most recent filing to the federal election commission, donald j. trump for president inc had almost $12 million on hand by the end of june, an increase of over $4 million since january. adav noti, a senior director at the campaign legal center, a watchdog group that describes itself as nonpartisan, said public campaign funds   as opposed to the private funds trump has raised   cannot generally be used for expenses arising from criminal investigations, or for any expenses that arise after the campaign is over. president bill clinton, who ran two publicly funded campaigns, had supporters start legal defense funds and used his own insurance to help pay legal bills during the whitewater investigation. he still wound up with millions of dollars in personal debt which he paid off through speaking fees he earned once he left office. hillary clinton, who ran a privately funded campaign, paid millions to campaign lawyers at perkins coie to handle routine legal matters, according to campaign filings. her campaign made no payments to the washington law firm williams & connolly, which represented her in the probes of her use of a private email server when she was u.s. secretary of state.  her lawyer, david kendall of williams & connolly, declined to comment on how he was paid. campaigns also have discretion to pay legal fees for others besides the president.  according to a july filing, the trump campaign paid $50,000 to the law firm of alan futerfas, who is representing donald trump jr. futerfas did not respond for requests for comment.  a number of other current and former trump staffers have also recently hired lawyers.

" north carolina republican lawmakers said late on wednesday they had reached a deal to repeal the state’s controversial law prohibiting transgender people from using restrooms in accordance with their gender identities. the compromise, reached with democratic governor roy cooper and set to go before the legislature for a vote thursday morning, would still ban local municipalities, schools and others from regulating bathroom access. it would also effectively forbid cities from offering their own job and restroom protections to vulnerable groups for nearly four years. “compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,” the state’s top republican lawmakers, senate leader phil berger and house of representatives speaker tim moore, said in a statement released late wednesday. the pair announced the deal at an impromptu news conference. the compromise with cooper, a staunch opponent of the bathroom law, was reached hours before the state was reportedly set to lose its ability to host any ncaa basketball championships.  the college athletic association is one of numerous organizations to sanction or boycott north carolina in the wake of the law’s passage last year. cooper said earlier this week that the measure could end up costing the state nearly $4 billion. he said he supported the compromise. “it’s not a perfect deal, but it repeals house bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation.” but it remained unclear whether the compromise would be acceptable to those who believe north carolina was unfriendly to the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. in an impassioned news conference before the deal was announced, several leading lgbt activists decried its provisions, including the bar on municipalities regulating employment practices and “public accommodations”. “this is a dirty deal,” said chad griffin, president of the human rights campaign. he vowed to continue fighting north carolina in court and in the public sphere if the new measure passes and is signed by cooper. on twitter wednesday night, san francisco based levi strauss & co., which has publicly opposed north carolina’s transgender bathroom law, urged lawmakers to reject what it called a “backroom” deal.    (this version of the story corrects griffin quote in paragraph 12, replacing “bill” with “deal”) ",0
" the u.s. senate passed legislation on tuesday that would allow families of sept. 11 victims to sue saudi arabia’s government for damages, setting up a potential showdown with the white house, which has threatened a veto. the saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly object to the bill. they had said they might sell up to $750 billion in u.s. securities and other american assets in retaliation if it became law. the “justice against sponsors of terrorism act,” or jasta, passed the senate by unanimous voice vote. it must next be taken up by the u.s. house of representatives, where the judiciary committee intends to hold a hearing on the measure in the near future, a committee aide said. if it became law, jasta would remove the sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on u.s. soil. it would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries. in this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in new york as lawyers try to prove that the saudis were involved in the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon. saudi foreign minister adel bin ahmed al jubeir has said his country’s objection to the bill is based on principles of international relations. “what (congress is) doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,” he said in a statement on tuesday. james kreindler, a prominent trial lawyer who represents 9/11 families and won large payouts for the victims of the 1988 bombing of pan american airways flight 103 over scotland, said he expected the bill to pass the house and become law. “it would be crazy for (president barack) obama to veto bipartisan legislation (which would) open (u.s.) courts to victims of the worst terrorist attack in u.s. history,” kreindler said. senator charles schumer, a new york democrat and a jasta co sponsor, said the bill is overdue. “today the senate has spoken loudly and unanimously that the families of victims of terrorist attacks should be able to hold the perpetrators, even if it’s a country, a nation, accountable,” schumer told a news conference. republican senator john cornyn, also a sponsor of the bill, said jasta does not target the saudis, although he alluded to a still classified section of a report on the sept. 11 attacks that saudi critics say might implicate riyadh. “we have yet to see the 28 pages that have not been yet released about the 9/11 report, and that may well be instructive,” cornyn said at the news conference. other lawmakers who have seen the 28 pages have said releasing them would quiet such rumors. cornyn said it was up to the court to decide whether the saudis were liable. “i don’t believe that this will be destructive of the relationship that we have with the kingdom of saudi arabia,” he said. the white house said obama still plans to veto jasta. “this legislation would change long standing, international law regarding sovereign immunity,” white house spokesman josh earnest told a daily press briefing. “and the president of the united states continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the united states vulnerable in other court systems around the world.” asked if senate democrats would back a veto, schumer said he would vote against obama. republican senator lindsey graham, who had opposed the bill, said the version passed on tuesday eased his worries that it might leave u.s. allies more vulnerable to lawsuits, for example if groups based within their borders but not supported by their governments were behind a terrorist attack. “we don’t want to alienate allies, but we do want to create redress if a nation state was involved in helping a terrorist organization attack american interests, and i think they should be held liable,” graham said in a brief interview.

" more than 50 female democratic lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives called on monday for a congressional investigation into allegations by various women of sexual misconduct against president donald trump, who has denied the accusations. “we cannot ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against mr. trump,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter, though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because republicans control the agenda in congress. the letter, spearheaded by the democratic women’s working group, which is composed of all the party’s female members in the house, was signed by 56 lawmakers. it followed a call earlier on monday by three women who have accused trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior. the lawmakers’ request for a probe was sent to leaders of the oversight and government reform committee, the main investigative committee in the house.  over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics. monday’s letter from the democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names. “the president’s own remarks appear to back up the allegations,” the letter said, saying trump had boasted “that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women.”  “the president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense,” said the lawmakers. the letter was addressed to oversight panel chairman trey gowdy, a republican, and top democrat elijah cummings. trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election, and said he had not done the things he talked about. more recently, trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his, the new york times reported recently. trump and white house officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. “these false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the american people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a white house spokesperson said in a statement on monday.

" the u.s. senate intelligence committee voted overwhelmingly on thursday in favor of president donald trump’s nominee to be director of national intelligence, former republican senator dan coats, sending his nomination to the senate floor. the vote, which took place in a closed hearing, was 13 2, the committee said. democratic senators ron wyden and kamala harris were the only two members to vote no. coats must still be confirmed by the full senate to be the top u.s. intelligence official. the popular former lawmaker, who also served as ambassador to germany, is expected to be confirmed easily. the office of the director of national intelligence was created after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee all 16 u.s. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. coats, 73, replaces james clapper, who retired as president barack obama left office. coats was a member of the senate intelligence panel until he retired from the senate at the end of last year. he pledged during his confirmation hearing on feb. 28 to support a thorough investigation of any russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. wyden, one of the senate’s leading privacy advocates, said he voted against his former colleague because he felt that the office of the director of national intelligence had not provided the committee with enough information about how many americans’ communication records have been subjected to government surveillance. “given that there has not been a firm commitment to deliver this critical information, i cannot support any dni nominee without that material,” wyden said in a statement. harris said that after consideration of coats’ record on a range of issues, she concluded she could not support his nomination. senators richard burr, the committee’s republican chairman, and mark warner, its top democrat, both said they were pleased the committee had backed coats. warner said he was confident that coats, as a former committee member, had respect for the panel’s oversight responsibilities.

" david rank, the chargé d’affaires of the u.s. embassy in beijing, has left the state department over the trump administration’s decision to quit the 2015 paris agreement to fight climate change, a senior u.s. official said on monday. a state department spokeswoman confirmed rank’s departure, but said she was unable to verify twitter posts that said he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to china of the u.s. decision last week to quit the agreement. “he has retired from the foreign service,” said anna richey allen, a spokeswoman for the department’s east asia bureau. “mr. rank has made a personal decision. we appreciate his years of dedicated service to the state department.” iowa governor terry branstad, president donald trump’s pick as the next u.s. ambassador to beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. a tweet from china expert john pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that rank had resigned as he could not support trump’s decision last week to withdraw from the paris agreement. another tweet from pomfret said rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the chinese government of the u.s. decision. a senior u.s. official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after rank announced his intention to retire on monday in beijing, he was told by the state department to leave his post immediately. the official spoke on condition of anonymity. on june 1, the u.s. state department accepted the resignation of its top personnel officer, who had been among its  few remaining senior obama administration political appointees, another u.s. official said. arnold chacon had served as the director general of the foreign service and director of human resources. the official said chacon had tendered his resignation when trump was inaugurated on jan. 20, along with all presidential appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the president and secretary of state. the acceptance of chacon’s resignation was first reported by the diplopundit website. it was not immediately clear whether he would be offered another post at the department.  other than secretary of state rex tillerson, his deputy john sullivan and undersecretary of state for political affairs tom shannon, the third ranking u.s. diplomat, most of the state department’s senior posts are currently vacant or filled by acting officials. chacon could not immediately be reached for comment.  contacted by reuters for comment, rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in beijing in january 2016, referred all questions to the u.s. embassy. jonathan fritz, the embassy’s economics councilor, would serve as chargé in his place, richey allen said. rank had been with the department for 27 years and served as the political councilor at the u.s. embassy in afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. trump’s announcement on thursday that he would withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord, saying it would undermine the u.s. economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. “the world has paid attention to the u.s. withdrawal from the paris agreement”, chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a regular news briefing on tuesday, but added that personnel changes were the united states’ “internal affairs”.

" diplomats from qatar and the four states boycotting it exchanged heated words at an arab league meeting on tuesday. tensions flared after qatar s minister of state for foreign affairs sultan bin saad al muraikhi discussed the boycott in his opening speech despite the gulf dispute not being on the agenda. he called the gulf monarchy s critics  rabid dogs .  even the animals were not spared, you sent them out savagely,  muraikhi said, referring to the thousands of camels left stranded on the border between qatar and saudi arabia after borders were closed.   saudi arabia, the uae, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest u.s. military base. the nations say doha supports regional foe iran and islamists. qatar denies the charges and calls the economic boycott a  siege  aimed at neutering an independent foreign policy it says promotes peaceful regional reform and fighting terrorism. kuwait has been trying to mediate in the dispute. during his speech, muraikhi referred to iran as an  honourable country  and said ties had warmed with its neighbor since the blockade.  in response, ahmed al qattan, saudi arabia s envoy to the arab league, said:  congratulations to iran and soon, god willing, you will regret it.  the exchange descended into a row during which muraikhi and qattan each told the other to be quiet.  muraikhi said saudi arabia was looking to depose the emir of qatar and replace him with foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani, who helped negotiate the entry of qatari pilgrims attending the annual haj pilgrimage into saudi arabia.  this is an improper thing to say because the kingdom of saudi arabia will never resort to such cheap methods and we don t want to change the regime, but you must also know that the kingdom can do anything it wants, god willing,  qattan said. egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry said muraikhi s comments were unacceptable.   we all know qatar s historic support for terrorism and what has been provided for extremist factions, and money in syria, yemen, libya and egypt that have lead to the death of many of egypt s sons,  shoukry said. qatar backed a muslim brotherhood government in egypt before it was overthrown by the military in 2013. the arab states have demanded qatar sever any links with the brotherhood and other groups they deem to be terrorist, ideological or sectarian.

" saudi arabian banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom as part of the government s anti corruption purge, bankers and lawyers said on tuesday. they added that the number is continuing to rise. dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain. since sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. the banker did not name the companies affected but said they included listed and unlisted firms across many sectors. he added that if the freezes stayed in place for long, they could start to hurt day to day business activities such as paying staff and creditors or making other transactions. a second banker said, however, that most of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals rather than companies, and that banks were being allowed by the regulator to continue to fund existing commitments. a central bank spokesman was not available to comment. among top business executives detained in the probe are billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal, chairman of investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se; nasser bin aqeel al tayyar, founder of al tayyar travel 1810.se; and amr al dabbagh, chairman of builder red sea international 4230.se. the stocks of all three companies, which have issued statements saying they continue to operate as normal, plunged between 9 and 10 percent on tuesday. one of the bankers speaking to reuters said the central bank had met with some foreign banks this week to reassure them that the freezing of accounts targeted individuals, and that firms linked to those people would not be damaged.

" about 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected islamic state militants have been moved to a new site north of mosul, iraqi authorities confirmed on monday, dismissing the concerns of aid organizations, who were not warned about the move.  they were transported to a safe location with better services, in tal keif, under the supervision of the iraqi forces and specialized committees,  said an iraqi military statement.  foreign aid officials in iraq said on sunday they were  gravely concerned  about the families, who had been held by iraq since aug. 30 in the hammam al alil transit camp, south of mosul.  these women and children are extremely vulnerable. regardless of what their family members may be accused of, they have a right to protection and assistance,  the norwegian refugee council said in a statement on monday.      none of the aid groups supporting the families at the camp, including the united nations, were told in advance about the move, according to the nrc spokeswoman in iraq, melany markham. the women and children were put on buses and taken away, with many leaving personal belongings behind. aid officials are asking the iraqi authorities for unfettered access to the families and calling on foreign governments to act quickly on behalf of their citizens.   humanitarian organizations and representatives from their home countries should be allowed to offer to them help,  the nrc said. more than 300 of the families came from turkey, many others from former soviet states, such as tajikistan, azerbaijan and russia, according to preliminary figures from the iraqi army. efforts to determine the nationalities of the families continued, said laila ali, a spokeswoman for unicef said.  thereafter, the family tracing and repatriation process is expected to begin.  most of the families had fled to tal afar after iraqi troops pushed islamic state out of mosul. iraqi forces retook tal afar, a city of predominantly ethnic turkmen that produced some of islamic state s senior commanders, last month. it is the largest group of foreigners linked to islamic state to be held by iraqi forces since they began driving the militants from mosul and other areas in northern iraq last year, an aid official said. thousands of foreigners have been fighting for islamic state in iraq and syria.

" under the gaze of a life sized cardboard figure of donald trump, some 200 of his supporters gathered at an exclusive club near the ritz hotel in london to celebrate friday’s inauguration of america’s 45th president. bunches of red, white and blue balloons, some of them star shaped, adorned the walls of the royal over seas league where trump’s appearance on the balcony outside the domed u.s. capitol was greeted with whooping and cheering. as he completed the oath, the room broke into a standing ovation complete with high five celebrations. later, trump’s inaugural speech was punctuated with cheers, especially his pledge to eradicate “radical islamic terrorism”, while at the end the room chorused along with trump’s trademark promise to make america great again. “the speech was great   mr trump just touched the most important subjects for america,” said polish born university professor victoria gorska rabuck. “his speech was very appropriate, very uplifting and promises a lot. we hope he can deliver what he promised,” she told reuters. businessman david pattinson said he thought trump would be a successful president. “i think he’ll succeed in cutting government spending although i don’t know whether he will be successful in getting rid of the establishment,” he said. “i wasn’t surprised when he won, i was satisfied,” he added. “i was expecting him to win. it was the same with brexit in how the polls got it wrong.” ",0
" a seoul court on friday found lotte group chairman shin dong bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years, leaving him free to try and revive the conglomerate after steep losses in china. the seoul central district court cleared the executive of some counts of breach of trust and one embezzlement charge.  i apologize to the public,  shin said as he left court, without commenting further. prosecutors had sought a ten year jail term for shin on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust after a probe since 2016 into the retail to chemicals group.       the ruling will come as a relief to lotte at the end of a tough year during which it became the highest profile corporate victim of a beijing seoul spat over south korea s installation of a u.s. missile defense system.  south korea s fifth largest conglomerate said,  we respect the court s decision. lotte group executives and employees will further unite to contribute to economic progress and do our best to meet our social responsibility.   the prosecution did not have an immediate comment. legal experts said the prosecution was likely to appeal. shin is the subject of another ongoing trial related to a bribery scandal involving former president park geun hye. prosecutors are seeking a four year jail term and a fine of 7 billion won ($6.49 million). in the meantime, friday s ruling means lotte, with 110.8 trillion won worth of assets, avoids a leadership vacuum for the time being as it navigates mounting china losses and an uncertain recovery. shunned in china, its key market, after it was pressed by seoul to provide land for the thaad missile defense system, lotte s third quarter china hypermarket sales were nearly wiped out to about $278,000 from around $264 million a year earlier.  nearly all lotte mart stores in china have been shut for much of the year with local authorities citing fire safety issues, and the group has now put the business up for sale.  but the sale is likely to be delayed past the end 2017 deadline lotte had sought, lotte corp official choi min ho said, without giving a reason.  lotte s businesses in south korea, including its major duty free operations, that had counted on big spending chinese tourists, remain under pressure amid curbs on chinese tour groups traveling to the country. south korea s credit rating agencies have downgraded or cut their outlook for corporate bonds of the group s flagship retailer lotte shopping and hotel lotte [htlot.ul], citing hurdles in improving their financial stability. lotte, which shelved plans for an estimated $4.5 billion ipo of hotel lotte amid the investigation, is now battening down the hatches as a difficult year draws to an end. lotte shopping has frozen wages for its department store business this year for the first time since 2009, three lotte officials said this week, declining to be identified as the matter was sensitive.  while lotte confirmed wages had been frozen, the retail to chemical conglomerate declined further comment.  however, one of the officials from the department store business said:  wages have been frozen due to various factors, but the thaad issue was one of them.

" after months of internal discord, republicans in the u.s. house of representatives on thursday approved a bill to overhaul the affordable care act, known as obamacare, which they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010.  two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill had collapsed in confusion, but republicans overcame their differences in a 217 213 vote that will send the bill to the senate, where its outlook was uncertain. obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of americans. an early estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers of the impact of the republican rollback bill, known as the american health care act, or ahca, said it would leave 24 million more americans without insurance coverage by 2026. here are the bill’s main provisions:  the republican plan would maintain some of obamacare’s most popular provisions. it would allow young adults to stay on their parents’ health plan until age 26. the bill would let states opt out of obamacare’s mandate that insurers charge the same rates on sick and healthy people. it would also allow states to opt out of obamacare’s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug costs.  the measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. the bill also would provide $8 billion over five years to help those with pre existing conditions pay for insurance. it would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. insurers won a provision they had long sought: the ability to charge older americans up to five times more than young people. under obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more.  the bill would end in 2018 obamacare’s income based tax credits that help low income people buy insurance. these would be replaced with age based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. while obamacare’s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the republican plan would be largely age based. the republican bill would abolish most obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high cost employer provided insurance known as “cadillac” plans. those taxes paid for obamacare. republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. the bill would also repeal the obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper income americans. it would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  under obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen republican states, expanded the medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. about half of obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. the bill would allow the medicaid expansion to continue until jan. 1, 2020. after that date, expansion would end and medicaid funding would be capped on a per person basis. state medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some obamacare mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a republican promise to return more control to the states.

" palestinian billionaire sabih al masri, jordan s most powerful businessman, returned to amman on tuesday after his release in saudi arabia secured when he agreed to pay an unspecified amount of money, sources close to the matter said.  masri was detained for questioning last week over his alleged links with saudi business partners among royals, ministers and officials who were rounded up last month in an unprecedented anti corruption purge. masri, chairman of amman based arab bank, jordan s largest lender, was taken into custody just before he was planning to leave saudi arabia after chairing meetings of saudi companies he owns, informed sources said.   he is at his home now in amman,  said a family source. masri later held meetings in the bank with senior officials. arab bank shares, which account for almost a quarter of the $24 billion market capitalization of the amman exchange, ended  1.48 percent higher as investors reacted favorably to the news of his return. masri has since taking the helm at arab bank in 2012 helped boost confidence in one of the arab world s largest private financial institutions.  the bank, first established in jerusalem in 1930 and one of the major middle east financial institutions, has a balance sheet of more than $45 billion and has earned a reputation of resilience in the face of regional political turmoil. masri, a saudi citizen, said from his home in riyadh on sunday after his release that the saudi authorities had accorded him  all respect . [l8n1oh05j] saudi officials have not commented on his detention. jordanian authorities privately said king abdullah intervened to secure his release. a source familiar with the matter said masri was freed after reaching a settlement to return an unspecified amount of money. there was no comment from the masri family.  there is no way masri has been freed without agreeing to some settlement. the saudis are telling anyone who has made huge sums of money that they have to pay back some of that wealth,  the source said. another source said riyadh saw these settlements not as blackmail but an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world s top oil producer over several decades. saudi authorities have already succeeded in reaching financial settlements with dozens of royal family members, senior officials and wealthy businessmen in the crackdown spearheaded by powerful crown prince mohammad bin salman. around 200 people in total have been questioned in the crackdown, authorities said last month. saudi authorities estimate they could eventually recover around $100 billion of illicitly held funds. they have been working on reaching agreements with suspects detained at riyadh s luxurious ritz carlton hotel, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom. masri s detention unnerved business circles in jordan and the palestinian territories as well as many arab magnates across the middle east who have made fortunes in saudi arabia, according to several investors who asked not to be named. his multi billion dollar investments in hotels and banking in jordan represent a cornerstone of the economy of the kingdom and he is by far the biggest investor in palestinian areas. a member of a prominent merchant family from nablus in the israeli occupied west bank, masri amassed a fortune by joining with influential saudi royals in a catering business to supply troops during the u.s. led military operation to retake kuwait from iraq in the 1991 gulf war. confidants said masri had been warned not to travel to the saudi capital after mass arrests of saudi royals, ministers and businessmen in early november. officials and businessmen had warned of the reverberations of the crisis on an aid strapped jordanian economy already plagued by high debts. saudi arabia is a major donor.

" the european commission proposed on wednesday ideas for deeper euro zone integration in an effort to help unite the broader european union, as eurosceptic sentiment grows across the eu and britain prepares to leave the eu in 2019. the commission, the eu s executive arm, presented a package of proposals aimed at giving the 19 countries sharing the euro better protection against future financial crises. but plans to tighten cooperation among the 19 euro countries have sparked concern among the eight non euro countries that they will become second class members of the eu, with less say   and less funds   in the future. to alleviate those fears, the commission stressed that all their proposals were open to all eu members, even though that clashes with the thinking of some euro zone leaders, such as french president emmanuel macron. macron has called for creating a euro zone budget of several hundred billion euros, a euro zone finance minister and a euro zone parliament. the commission proposed creating cash incentives for countries for structural reforms and special funds for non euro economies, all of which   except denmark   are obligated to adopt the euro at some point, to prepare for euro adoption.  but heavyweight germany was quick to pour cold water on one key part of the plans putting in doubt just how far they would get.   the commission backed the idea of setting up what it calls a euro zone  stabilisation function , because the monetary policy of the european central bank cannot deal with economic crises that hit only one or a few countries in the euro zone. that would be a pool of money to protect investment with loans and a relatively  limited grant component , the commission said. to be effective and credible, it should be big enough to pay out at least 1 percent of gdp and be allowed to borrow.  access to the  stabilisation function , managed by the commission, would be for those who stick to eu rules.  the money would come from loans from the eu budget, voluntary contributions from governments and loans from the euro zone bailout fund with guarantees from the eu budget. the commission said that for this to work,  a limited borrowing capacity could be constructed  in the next eu budget. germany expressed reservations though.  i don t think it makes sense to prejudge anything, but the outgoing government was not convinced that new buffers at the european level are necessary,  germany s acting finance minister peter altmaier said. instead of a euro zone finance minister, the commission called for naming a pan european minister of economy and finance, who would also be a senior member of the european commission and chair meetings of euro zone finance ministers. the minister would also oversee the work of the euro zone bailout fund as the chairman of its board, much like the head of euro zone finance ministers, the eurogroup, does now. the job might be created when the next european commission starts work in november 2019, the commission said, and whoever gets it would be accountable to the european parliament. under the current arrangement, the chair of the euro zone finance ministers, the closest thing the bloc now has to a single finance minister, often testifies before the parliament s economic committee, but it has no power over him or her. euro zone finance ministers have little enthusiasm for allowing the commission, which is only an observer at their monthly meetings, to chair their talks. other euro zone integration ideas, floated by germany, include transforming the euro zone s government owned and run  bailout fund into a european monetary fund. the commission backed that idea, but said the emf should become an eu institution, which would be overseen by the european parliament   an idea officials have said would not fly with governments.  the emf, which the commission hopes to get agreement on by mid 2019 from governments and the european parliament, would also provide a 60 billion euro backstop for the bank funded single resolution fund. the commission did not address the proposal of germany and backed by slovakia and the netherlands to create a sovereign insolvency mechanism that would put pressure on governments to conduct prudent fiscal policy. economists were not impressed with the commission proposals.  a first browsing of the documents allows us to conclude that hardly anything will change,  ing economist carsten brzeski wrote in a note to clients.  today s proposals go in the right direction but are not new and clearly not a game changer.

" german chancellor angela merkel opened what promised to be marathon coalition talks on friday, hoping to bring three opposing political camps into a stable government despite signs  there would be less money to paper over differences. merkel said she was optimistic as she entered talks between her conservative bloc, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and the greens, despite an assessment by her own party that the next government would have less fiscal room than expected. the outcome of the talks is keenly awaited both at home and across europe, with many fretting that the european union could be rudderless with the bloc s longest serving leader too busy to grapple with crucial issues like euro zone governance reform. highlighting the challenge, a report by merkel s christian democrats (cdu) found that there would be only 30 billion euros free for new projects over the next four years if parties stuck to their commitment to taking on no new debts. the shortfall will make all the more difficult the tricky three way pact, dubbed a  jamaica  coalition because the three parties  colors   black, yellow and green   match those of the jamaican flag, which is untried at national level. higher eu contributions as a result of brexit and lower central bank profits might reduce spending room by some 15 billion euros, according to calculations seen by reuters, an obstacle to the fdp s demands for tax cuts or the greens  hope for environmental and infrastructure spending. the talks between merkel s conservative bloc, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and the greens are styled as  exploratory , but negotiators aim to get down to details of tax and budget policy in their first full meeting together.  there will be many differences,  she said on her arrival at the berlin talks, adding:  there is readiness on my side to think about this creatively.  party delegations each made five minute presentations before breaking ahead of further discussions due on tuesday. fdp chief christian lindner had earlier said that no matter how good the  atmosphere and seriousness  the parties were far apart on 85 percent of the material to be discussed. after, fdp secretary general nicola beer said she continued to believe there was a  50:50  chance of a jamaica coalition resulting. merkel, weakened by a surging far right in last month s national election, needs to make the awkward alliance fly as her previous  grand coalition  partners   the center left social democrats (spd)   say they want to rebuild in opposition after  their worst election result in more than half a century. merkel has been able to steer europe through its euro zone and refugee crises in part due to her dominance at home. now that dominance is waning   her conservatives last month had their weakest election showing since 1949.  voters have given these parties the task of governing,  wrote newspaper die welt.  these possible partners should not be giving the impression that they are inching warily toward each other like strangers in a crammed lift.  an infratest dimap poll for ard showed 83 percent of germans wanted the parties to find a compromise deal. merkel, 63, has suffered two further setbacks since the national election: the cdu was defeated in a regional election in lower saxony on sunday, and the party s premier in the eastern state of saxony resigned on wednesday, saying younger, fresher leadership was needed to revitalize the conservatives. should the three party groups fail to form a coalition, some in their ranks fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the far right alternative for germany (afd), which entered parliament for the first time last month. if she cannot clinch a three way coalition pact, merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections   an unprecedented scenario. alternatively, she could try to team up again with the spd. the social democrats reject that option, though senior party official thomas oppermann has indicated they could reconsider on one condition: merkel steps aside.

" when hewlett packard enterprise ceo meg whitman announced last week that she wouldn’t vote for her party’s presidential nominee, donald trump, she pledged to raise money for the democratic candidate, hillary clinton, and to urge like minded republicans to follow suit. she won’t have to talk her fellow tech industry conservatives into spurning trump: they already have. his campaign has pulled in less than 6 percent of what republican nominee mitt romney had raised from tech donors by this point in the 2012 race.  but raising money for clinton may prove difficult. while the democrat has raised 25 times more than trump from tech donors so far, she has drawn less than half of what president barack obama had raised from tech employees by this point four years ago, and less than bernie sanders, her opponent in the democratic primary, collected before he left the race. tech industry employees – long a reliable source of presidential donations, especially for democrats – have refused to open their wallets for trump, and they’ve been stingier than usual with clinton, too, according to an analysis performed for reuters by crowdpac, a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that analyzes campaign contribution data.  trump and clinton together reported having received $3.5 million from tech workers as of june 30, compared with $11 million donated to president barack obama and his republican rival mitt romney through june 2012, according to the crowdpac analysis. in 2008, more than $8.3 million in tech donations had gone to obama and mccain by june 30. for a graphic tracking contributions from tech workers in the last three elections, see: tmsnrt.rs/2b3neuk the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this story. the clinton campaign asked for the methodology of the crowdpac analysis but did not comment on its findings. to quantify the tech industry’s political giving, crowdpac tallied contributions of more than $200   the federal election commission’s reporting threshold   from donors who listed technology companies as their employers, as well as individuals who work in related roles, such as software engineers and venture capitalists. contributions to campaigns, super pacs and joint fundraising committees were included. the analysis may have missed people who work at small technology companies not yet recognized by crowdpac, as well as individuals who have given less than $200. technology firms lobby the government on a range of issues, from privacy and encryption to immigration and trade, and they have a strong interest in who sits in the oval office. but this year, campaign finance records and interviews with more than two dozen people in the industry suggest that many would be donors in silicon valley remain unwashed by either candidate.  matt mcilwain, managing director of madrona venture group, gave money to romney in 2011 and to republican marco rubio in year’s presidential primary election. but he won’t support either trump or clinton in the general election.  “candidates need to have that embrace of innovation and articulate how it is a road for anybody in our society,” he said. “i’m not inspired by either of the major party candidates.”  democrats consistently draw more tech money than republicans, but the giving is unusually lopsided this year. trump has raised a mere $128,000 from 238 tech donors so far. clinton, by contrast, has raised $3.4 million from 2,976 individuals in the industry, according to crowdpac’s analysis.  at this point in 2012, romney had raised $2.3 million and obama had raised $8.8 million. silicon valley republicans say trump’s paltry donation totals are no surprise given his public statements attacking the tech industry.  earlier this year, trump called for a boycott of apple products after the company stopped cooperating with federal law enforcement efforts to break into the password protected iphone of one attacker in the mass shooting in san bernardino. trump also accused amazon ceo jeff bezos of orchestrating an online retail monopoly.  trump’s positions on limiting immigration and free trade run counter to some of the industry’s most basic interests. for clinton, having a long track record in politics is a liability with some donors in an industry that reveres innovation.  “she’s an incremental technocrat, and for people who are used to taking on the world, that is not very inspiring,” said gregory ferenstein, author of “the age of optimists,” a book about politics and silicon valley. to be sure, clinton has many friends in silicon valley, and she has had considerably more success than trump in wooing deep pocket donors in the industry.  venture capitalist john doerr, for example, has contributed $569,500 to the clinton campaign and affiliate super pacs and fundraising committees, and zynga co founder mark pincus has given $358,800, according to crowdpac. many in the valley reason that backing clinton is the surest way to thwart trump. “we want to make it clear what the risks are of a trump presidency, but it’s much more energizing to get excited about a candidate,” box chief executive aaron levie said in an interview. some of obama’s biggest silicon valley backers have yet to give money in this race, including pandora media chief executive tim westergren, who had donated $74,100 to obama and to fundraising committees and affiliated super pacs by june 2012, and venture capitalist vinod khosla, who had given $35,000, according to a crowdpac analysis of donations. reliable gop donors, too, have held back. tiger global management founder charles coleman and venture capitalist marc andreessen   both of whom had given $102,500 to romney and affiliated super pacs and fundraising committees by june 2012   had yet to donate by june 30. andreessen has endorsed clinton. westergren and khosla did not respond to requests for comment; coleman and andreessen declined to comment. carrie sheffield, founder of multimedia company bold, typically votes for republicans and donated to romney, but she says she won’t give to   or vote for   trump.  “i don’t think that he’s fit for office,” she said. both clinton and trump have also struggled to convert many donors who gave to their opponents in the primary.  bernie sanders raised far more in tech donations during the primary than clinton, pulling in $6.2 million before leaving the primary race, most of it in small contributions.  in the republican primary, marco rubio drew $5.3 million in tech donations, thanks to a handful of large gifts from top tech executives, including oracle’s larry ellison, mark hurd and safra catz.  josh smith, a sanders donor who does not plan to vote in the presidential election, said he was troubled by clinton’s comments in a debate last year urging tech companies to work with law enforcement to prevent attacks. the remarks left some in the industry feeling that clinton would not protect their livelihoods and did not share their beliefs about “the sanctity of information,” said smith, founder of code corps, which helps developers work on public software projects for social good.  sanders donor xiaohoa michelle ching said she will vote for clinton, but has had trouble supporting a candidate who has been readying her path to the presidency for so long.  “i am not going to go out of my way, even with the threat of a trump presidency,” said ching, who is chief executive of literator, an educational technology startup. ferenstein predicts that silicon valley donations to clinton will pick up.  “you’ll see much more money from silicon valley flow to clinton toward the end of the race,” he predicted, “because people are scared of a president trump.”  ",0
" the czech president s spokesman likened the european union to the third reich of adolf hitler on thursday while criticizing the bloc s executive over a regulation on food safety. jiri ovcacek made the comment while citing the case of an ingredient in a czech potato based alcohol locally known as  rum  that cannot be labeled that way due to an eu ban which says the term must be reserved for cane based spirits. the eu s food watchdog, the european food safety authority (efsa), has ruled that the ingredient, called rum ether, should be discontinued and replaced gradually from april 2018 on the grounds that it contains a material that can damage body cells. ovcacek shared an article from a czech news website on his facebook page on the issue, adding the comment:  the empire has decided that there will be no  tuzemak  (czech rum) to drink in the protectorate.   empire  in the czech context is often understood to refer to hitler s third reich, while the  protectorate  is what the country was called by the nazi regime during world war two. when asked about the comment, ovcacek said his words were warranted because such actions by some in the eu damaged its reputation.  it points to the absolute insensibility of the european commission,  ovcacek said. ovcacek s comments have led to controversy before, such as his outbursts against prime minister bohuslav sobotka and some of his ministers, and even against the czech media. czech president milos zeman has portrayed himself as a europhile and fan of a federal eu. but he has also expressed pro russian and anti immigration views and built up relations with china, in contrast to the pro western and human rights based style of czech foreign policy established by the late president vaclav havel.

" the check has been sent. that was the message from the white house on wednesday after the father of a slain u.s. army sergeant said a generous offer from president donald trump had not materialized. chris baldridge told the washington post that trump offered his family $25,000 after the death of his 22 year old son at the hands of an afghan police officer in june. but he told the newspaper the money never arrived. a white house spokeswoman said on wednesday the media was advancing a “biased agenda” by following up on the baldridge story. “the check has been sent,”  white house spokeswoman lindsay walters said in an email. “it’s disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the president, and using it to advance the media’s biased agenda.” the issue added to controversy over trump’s response to military families who have lost loved ones. on monday, trump  said some of his predecessors “didn’t do anything” to console relatives of fallen soldiers, drawing widespread criticism. trump offered no evidence to back up his claim, which was immediately shown to be false. on wednesday, trump denied an account by representative frederica wilson of florida that he had told the widow of sergeant la david t. johnson, who was killed in a firefight in niger, that the man knew “what he signed up for.” “i didn’t say what that congresswoman said,” trump told reporters earlier in the day. “i had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife who ... sounded like a lovely woman,” he said.  sergeant johnson’s mother, cowanda jones johnson, told the washington post on wednesday that she was present during trump’s  call to her son’s widow and she supported the congresswoman’s account of trump’s comment. “president trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,” jones johnson said.

" advisers to republican presidential nominee donald trump pledged to u.s. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on friday. eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with trump’s top agricultural advisers in washington on monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival democratic nominee hillary clinton in june. the presidential candidates’ agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net u.s. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. if that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. for trump’s team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against clinton for the nov. 8 election. he reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman paul manafort. agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included charles herbster, national chairman of trump’s agricultural advisory committee, and sam clovis, trump’s chief policy advisor, participants told reuters. former nebraska governor dave heineman, who is on trump’s advisory committee, also attended, they said. “there was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues,” said barb glenn, chief executive officer of the national association of state departments of agriculture.  also, there was a focus on “the concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government,” she said. clinton’s campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said jay vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association croplife america, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates. “both of them are quite interested in understanding where american ag is at,” he said. trump on tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six u.s. governors, a former u.s. department of agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the u.s. house and senate agriculture committees. the latest realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton 6 percentage points ahead of trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.

" george h.w. bush and his son george w. bush did not vote for fellow republican donald trump last year, says the author of a new book on the 41st and 43rd u.s. presidents in which they open up about their disapproval of the man now occupying the white house. the elder bush voted for hillary clinton, while his son voted for neither trump nor his democratic challenger, or “none of the above,” said mark k. updegrove, who wrote “the last republicans” with the cooperation of the two bushes. harpercollins will publish the book on nov. 14. in an interview with the new york times, updegrove said the elder bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of trump though he did not know him personally.  in an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, george h.w. bush told the author that trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service. the younger bush, 71, who served in the white house from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son.  during the campaign, george w. bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last republican elected president. “at the time, i think he was concerned that hillary clinton would win,” updegrove told the times.  “but if you look at his values and those shared by his father and ronald reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the republican party today, in particular the platform that donald trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency. updegrove could not be reached for further comment. “the american people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change   instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement. “if they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”  like many americans, george w. bush was surprised that trump fared so well in last year’s republican state primaries, where his brother jeb, a former florida governor, emerged as one of trump’s most frequent targets.  during the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in washington, a vow that extended to the republican establishment, which the bush family epitomized. the book follows a rare speech by the younger bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style. the 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.

" president donald trump’s administration on thursday proposed a 31 percent cut to the environmental protection agency’s budget, as the white house seeks to eliminate climate change programs and trim initiatives to protect air and water quality.  the epa would sustain the biggest cut of any federal agency in the white house 2018 budget, as trump seeks to clear away regulations he claims are hobbling u.s. oil drillers, coal miners and farmers. the proposed cuts are a starting point, and congress could temper them in its budget deliberations. the proposal would slash funding for enforcing regulations, fighting water pollution, cleaning up sites contaminated by toxic waste and promoting energy efficient appliances. it would eliminate 3,200 epa employees, or 19 percent of the agency’s workforce. it would effectively erase former president barack obama’s initiatives to combat climate change by cutting funding for the agency’s signature clean power plan aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. “consistent with the president’s america first energy plan, the budget reorients the epa’s air program to protect the air we breathe without unduly burdening the american economy,” a summary of the proposed epa budget said. some lawmakers from trump’s republican party praised the proposed cuts, but some expressed concern about cuts to programs affecting their region of the country. environmentalists blasted the plan, saying it would return america back to 1977 when smoggy skies and polluted rivers pushed lawmakers to strengthen federal clean air and clean water laws. scott pruitt, the epa administrator, disputes the scientific consensus that human actions are the lead cause of climate change. in his former position as attorney general of oil producing oklahoma, he sued the epa more than a dozen times. pruitt believes congress should determine whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant that needs regulation. with both chambers currently led by republicans, and influential committees headed by lawmakers from oil producing states, that is unlikely anytime soon.      the budget would also eliminate some $100 million in spending on research and international programs on combating climate change. trump also doubts the science of climate change and has said the country can reduce green regulations drastically without compromising air and water quality.  asked about climate change programs, mick mulvaney, trump’s budget director, told reporters “we consider that to be a waste of your money.”  “i think the president is fairly straightforward. we’re not spending money on that,” he said.    the epa had already faced sharp cuts under obama. janet mccabe, a former epa air official, said trump’s proposed budget would harm the epa’s ability to respond to emergencies and also hurt day to day efforts on keeping air and water clean to protect human health.  the proposed cuts would cut $427 million aimed at regional pollution cleanup programs, including in the great lakes and chesapeake bay. funding for the superfund program to clean up the nation’s most contaminated sites would drop by $330 million to $762 million. the summary said the budget seeks to give local and state governments responsibility for such clean up efforts. many states and municipalities also face severe budget constraints in the current fiscal environment.  trump’s proposal includes a 31 percent budget cut for the enforcement division, which fines companies for pollution. it would ax dozens of other programs including the popular energy star appliance efficiency program aimed at reducing u.s. energy consumption.  “turning back the clock to 1977 will not ‘make america great again’. it will ‘make america gag again,’” said conrad schneider, the advocacy director at clean air task force.  one area that would see a small boost is for state revolving funds, low interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure. the plan would add $4 million to the funds, bringing its budget up to $100 million. while employees at epa headquarters in washington worried about their jobs, some hoped opportunities might open up at the other side of the country.  representatives of california, where state energy commissions and a clean air agency are hiring, handed recruitment fliers to epa employees on their way to work. the fliers said: “fight climate change, work for california.” ",0
" u.s. senate democrats, seeking to capitalize on growing disclosures about the trump campaign’s contacts with russia, urged a top republican lawmaker on tuesday to obtain president donald trump’s tax returns as a matter of national security. it was the second request for trump’s returns by senate democrats in as many weeks, part of a democratic campaign to pressure republicans in congress into obtaining the documents that could reveal conflicts of interest posed by the president’s global business empire. trump has defied decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, saying his tax affairs were under federal audit. the internal revenue service has said that is no obstacle to releasing them publicly. in a letter on tuesday to senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch, two of the panel’s leading democrats said trump’s tax returns should be pursued in light of “critical national security implications” posed by contacts between russian ambassador sergei kislyak and trump associates, including u.s. attorney general jeff sessions. “there is no debate that the conflicts in question pose a threat to american national security and the integrity of the government of the united states, and more and more keep coming to light,” wrote senator ron wyden of oregon, the committee’s top democrat, and senator debbie stabenow of michigan. hatch and house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady rejected a request for the returns last wednesday by senate democrats, saying congressional actions that target individual tax returns would constitute an abuse of authority and set a dangerous precedent. on tuesday, a hatch spokesman said the utah republican had no further comment.  the two democratic lawmakers said national security had long been a focus of the senate finance committee oversight of issues involving trade, iran and terrorism. they also said the panel previously sought the tax returns of former enron corp executives, oil and gas companies and the association of community organizations for reform now, or acorn, as part of its oversight duties. wyden and stabenow said they wanted the committee to hold a closed session in which lawmakers could conduct a bipartisan review of trump’s returns.  they added: “if committee members identify ties or relations to foreign governments within these documents, we will respectfully request the chairman and members of the committee hold a vote to make that information available to the public.” ",0
" the united states and vietnam on tuesday signed an agreement allowing the u.s. peace corps to work in the country for the first time. the signing, which comes amid a historic three day visit by president barack obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a peace corps operation in vietnam. the program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows peace corps volunteers to teach english in schools in the country’s two largest cities, hanoi and ho chi minh city, said peace corps director carrie hessler radelet, who signed the agreement with vietnam’s ambassador to the united states, pham quang vinh. u.s. secretary of state john kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the united states and vietnam. “for 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship,” said kerry, who in 1968 served as a young u.s. naval officer in the vietnam war.  “this is normal, having the peace corps being able to move forward, having young americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach english in hanoi and ho chi minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the united states and vietnam,” he added. after the signing, hessler radelet turned to kerry saying: “you’ve waited for this for a long time.” ",0
" the top democrat on the u.s. senate banking committee told bankers gathered in washington on tuesday that his party would not support drastic changes to the dodd frank financial reform law. sen. sherrod brown said he was eager to work on areas of bipartisan agreement, but made clear big changes to dodd frank, created after the 2008 financial crisis, do not fit that bill. “what we will not do is a wholesale rollback of dodd frank,” he said at an american bankers association conference. “that would be counterproductive... the law is working.” brown argued that significant changes to the 2010 law, which republicans are seeking, would actually be problematic for the banking industry, even as he expressed a willingness to revisit specific parts of financial rules. “big changes create uncertainty, which is bad for everyone,” he said. shortly after president donald trump was elected, his transition team said it would “dismantle” the dodd frank legislation. as president, trump has voiced support for efforts by the republican chair of the house of representatives financial services committee, jeb hensarling, to rewrite the law. he has also directed agencies to review how dodd frank regulations affect banks and other financial services companies.  brown said he would not resist any and all efforts to revisit rules on the financial sector, expressing fondness for the new republican chairman of the banking panel, sen. mike crapo. “the days of the senate banking committee and its dysfunction and, let’s just say less than busy work ethic, i hope is behind us,” he said. “we both have a commitment to work on issues we can come together on.” on monday, crapo and brown jointly announced they were seeking public input on policy changes that could “foster economic growth.” efforts to relax certain rules, particularly for smaller community banks and credit unions, could be an area of common ground for the two. crapo took control of the panel from sen. richard shelby in 2017, after the end of shelby’s term as its head.

" two attackers shot several civilians on monday in the nahrawan area southeast of baghdad before one blew himself up and the other was killed by security forces, the iraqi interior ministry said, without providing official casualty figures. local media reported at least 17 people were killed and 28 wounded.  islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack, described by an interior ministry spokesman as  a terrorist attack by two terrorist suicide attackers who fired indiscriminately on citizens in the nahrawan area .  the sunni muslim militant group s amaq news agency said it had killed 35 members of one of the iran backed shi ite militias known as the popular mobilisation forces.  iraqi security officials say islamic state is likely to wage an insurgency after its self proclaimed caliphate collapsed and its militants were dislodged from territories they held across a swathe of iraq and syria.

" an ambitious asia pacific trade pact linking the united states and 11 countries lay in tatters on tuesday after u.s. president elect donald trump said he would kill the deal on his first day in office on jan. 20. trump’s statement appeared to open the way for china to assume the united states’ leadership mantle on trade and diplomacy in asia. the republican termed the trans pacific partnership (tpp) “a potential disaster for our country.” china, japan and south korea are already in the initial stages of discussing a trilateral trade deal, and beijing has been pushing its own limited asian regional trade pact that excludes washington for the past five years. japan and australia, washington’s closest allies in asia, pledged after trump’s announcement to push ahead without the united states, although removing the largest market for goods and services would shrink it dramatically. “pushing them forward is the idea that, if they don’t act, it will look like china’s very weak trade deals are the only game in town,” said derek scissors, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute, where he focuses on asian economies and trade. trump has pledged to redraw trade deals to win back american jobs, and has threatened mexico and china with punitive tariffs in a move that some economists have warned could spark a trade war that threatens to roll back decades of liberalization. ending the tpp was a key election pledge of trump’s and was also the policy of his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. the deal died in congress after trump’s nov. 8 election victory. the trans pacific partnership, a signature diplomatic initiative of democratic president barack obama, was intended to lower tariff barriers in countries that accounted for 40 percent of the world economy, as well as providing a bulwark against china. a major trade deal between the united states and europe is also now close to collapse after britain’s plans to withdraw from the european union prompted washington to demand better terms and opposition in france and germany has also all but scuppered it. japanese prime minister shinzo abe said “the tpp would be meaningless without the united states,” even as parliament continued debating ratification and his government vowed to lobby other members to approve it.  “it (the pact) just continues in a state of not being in effect,” said shinpei sasaki of the cabinet office’s tpp headquarters. australian trade minister steven ciobo told reporters in canberra that countries could push ahead with the tpp without the united states by amending the agreement and possibly adding new members.  “we could look at, for example, if china or indonesia or another country wanted to join, saying, ‘yes, we open the door for them signing up to the agreement as well.’” but singapore prime minister lee hsien loong said reopening negotiations would not be easy. “if you sign a fresh agreement, you have to go through it again. we haven’t crossed that bridge yet. we’ll cross it if and when we come to that.” china has pushed its own regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep), which notably excludes the united states. it is a more traditional trade agreement, involving cutting tariffs rather than opening up economies and setting labor and environmental standards as tpp would. the rcep was a focus of attention at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in peru over the weekend. tan jian, a senior member of china’s delegation at the summit, said more countries are now seeking to join its 16 member bloc, including peru and chile, and current members want to reach a deal as soon as possible to counter rising protectionism. china’s foreign ministry said on tuesday that beijing has an “open attitude” toward any arrangements that promote free trade in the region as long they don’t become “fragmented and  politicized.” foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the rcep was an initiative led by the 10 member association of southeast asian nations (asean), which china has been promoting. “we are willing to keep pushing the (rcep) talks process with all sides to achieve positive progress at an early date,” he said.  vietnam last week shelved its own ratification of tpp, after obama abandoned efforts to push it through a lame duck congress, while malaysia has shifted its attention to the rcep. at a u.s. china agricultural trade seminar in washington, senior obama administration officials and their chinese counterparts appeared to ignore the elephant in the room: the collapse of tpp and trump’s tough trade talk against china. u.s. agriculture secretary tom vilsack said he was focused in a u.s. china trade negotiators meeting in washington this week on reducing china’s regulatory and food safety barriers to american beef, poultry and genetically modified crops out of china. “there hasn’t been a discussion about the future, there’s really a focus on the present,” vilsack said when asked about what he was telling his chinese counterparts about the risks posed by an incoming trump administration. chinese vice premier wang yang did not address trump’s trade rhetoric at the discussion in washington, but warned that a closing of agricultural trade would be “unacceptable to our farmers.” “china is one of the most important markets for agricultural exports, accounting for nearly a fifth of u.s. agricultural exports. ... on average, every u.s. farmer exports about $12,000 of agricultural products to china” every year, wang said.

" democratic candidate hillary clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the electoral college and claim the u.s. presidency, according to the latest reuters/ipsos states of the nation project results released on saturday. in the last week, there has been little movement. clinton leads donald trump in most of the states that trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. according to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. the mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for clinton to 212 for trump. trump came off his best debate performance of the campaign wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed clinton winning the third and final face off on prime time tv. trump disputes those findings. and some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had clinton maintaining her solid lead. but the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for trump with 17 days to go until the nov. 8 election.  trump did gain ground in south carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss up. unfortunately for him, he lost ground in arizona, which is now too close to call. additionally, he is facing a challenge for utah’s six electoral college votes from former cia operative and utah native evan mcmullin. the independent candidate is siphoning votes away from trump in a state that is republican as any in the nation. in some polls, mcmullin is even leading. (the states of the nation is not polling on mcmullin.) utah, like almost all of the states, is a winner take all contest. clinton has also maintained a lead in florida and pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 electoral college votes. ohio remains too close to call. according to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits trump but his best hope for success is if republican turnout surges and democratic turnout is low. to examine these results and other scenarios, go to the states of the nation project here .

" the obama administration has rejected a plea by billionaire investor william koch to refund as much as $14 million in royalties on a now shut colorado mine, according to a letter explaining the decision. the interior department last week ruled that oxbow mining, a subsidiary of koch controlled oxbow carbon llc, is not entitled to a ‘royalty rate reduction’ since the move would do nothing to return the mine to life. reducing royalty rates has been a tool used by the federal government for decades when maximizing coal production was part of a national energy policy. oxbow closed its elk creek site in western colorado two years ago after setbacks such as a fire and partial collapse made working the underground mine too costly, according to the company and regulatory paperwork. oxbow has said it has no plans to reopen the facility, which once employed more than 200 people. machinery is being sold for scrap and the mine is ready to be sealed, according to regulatory paperwork. “these circumstances indicate that a royalty rate reduction will not expand recovery or promote further development of the leases,” the interior department’s bureau of land management wrote last week in a letter made public on monday. ‘royalty rate reduction’ and other such programs meant to promote coal production on public lands are now under scrutiny since president barack obama has vowed to curb the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming. william koch was an heir to the fred c. koch family fortune, and two of his brothers, charles and david, are leading figures in conservative politics. while william koch is not as politically prominent as his brothers, he has been a significant political donor to conservative causes in the past. a spokesman for koch and oxbow did not immediately respond to a call for comment. rocky mountain coal has been valued at $35 a ton or more in the last several years, according to a reuters review of energy information administration data. because the blm recommends a royalty rate reduction on 13.1 million tons of coal, the decision positions oxbow to receive at least a $14 million refund on fuel mined since 2012, according to a reuters calculation.",0
" the senate intelligence committee, investigating russian meddling in u.s. 2016 election, has asked president donald trump’s political organization to hand over all documents going back the campaign’s launch in june 2015, the washington post reported on friday, citing two people briefed on the request.  the letter from the senate panel seeking all documents, emails and telephone records arrived at trump’s campaign committee last week and was addressed to its treasurer, the post said. this marked the first time the trump campaign organization has been drawn into the bipartisan committee’s investigation into russian interference in the presidential election, it said. dozens of former campaign staffers are expected to be contacted soon to ensure they are aware of the request, the post said, citing the two people. the letter was signed by republican senator richard burr, the committee’s chairman, and senator mark warner, its top democrat, according to the post, which said representatives for burr and warner declined to comment. the senate panel’s investigation is among several in congress into russian interference in the election, and is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the justice department, former federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller. trump’s campaign committee, based at trump tower in new york, is now led by michael glassner, a former deputy campaign manager, and john pence, a nephew of vice president mike pence, the post said. glassner did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a white house representative had no immediate comment, the post said. trump’s administration has been dogged by concerns about its ties to russia and questions over whether trump associates may have cooperated with russians as they sought to meddle in last year’s election on trump’s behalf. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded in january that moscow tried to sway the november vote in trump’s favor. russia has denied involvement, and trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and russia. controversy has engulfed trump since he fired fbi director james comey on may 9 as comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and russia.

" libya put 142 illegal migrants on a flight back to guinea on wednesday with the help of the u.n. migration agency, officials said, as the north african country steps up deportations to ease severe overcrowding in its detention centers. the number of people stuck in libyan detention centers has risen dramatically this year after armed groups largely shut down the boat route to italy from the smuggling hub of sabratha. the international organization for migration flew the guinean migrants from two western cities to the city of misrata, from where they boarded a plane for conakry. the deportations come in the wake of a cnn report on migrants being sold for slave labor that sparked an international outcry. migrant flows through libya have surged since 2014. more than 600,000 people have crossed the central mediterranean to italy in the past three years, but departures from libya s coast dropped sharply in july when armed groups in sabratha began preventing boats from leaving. after clashes in the western city in september, thousands of migrants held near the coast emerged and were transferred to detention centers under the nominal control of the u.n. backed government in tripoli. amnesty international said this month that up to 20,000 people are being held in detention centers and are subject to  torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings . other human rights organizations have said similar things in recent months.

" two of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s closest allies have initiated legislation in what opponents say is a rearguard action to try to shield him from a police probe into corruption allegations against him. netanyahu is a suspect in two cases, one into alleged meddling in the media industry and the other into gifts he received from rich businessmen. he denies any wrongdoing. but, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate. two lawmakers who want netanyahu to stay in power have proposed two new draft laws that have alarmed the attorney general and the police. one would bar police from providing prosecutors with the investigators  conclusions on whether charges should be brought against suspects. the second, known as the  french law  because of similarities with legislation in france, would delay any investigation of a prime minister until he or she leaves office. netanyahu, a right wing leader now in his fourth term, has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation, but he has not ordered his coalition head, david bitan and his co sponsor of the bills, david amsalem, to withdraw the bills. bitan said that once police publish their findings, suspects are convicted in the court of public opinion even if they are eventually cleared. those who oppose the draft bills are more worried about toppling netanyahu than about democracy, he said.  they (the bills) protect democracy. suspects have rights too,  bitan told reuters.  the  french law  has not yet been brought before parliament. coalition partners are at odds over its phrasing but bitan says he will not shelve the legislation.  the bill, he said, would not apply to the present investigations against the prime minister. but if passed, it could potentially affect any future legal moves affecting netanyahu in at least one other case in which he is currently not a suspect. [l5n1nd240] parliament passed the first draft in an initial reading this month but both drafts may ultimately fall through before being written into law. the  french law  would not apply to any investigations under way, but the other proposed law would.  in comments leaked to the media, attorney general avichai mandelblit complained about  a multitude of proposals that are meant to harm us all .  lawmakers and cabinet ministers have a right to propose bills, he said in remarks broadcast on army radio. but, in comments suggesting they were politically motivated, added that   this batch is not innocent .  i m being attacked on all fronts with means that are not within the rules of the democratic game,  mandelblit said.      police also said, in a statement to reuters, that they had come under pressure from politicians.   police will keep with its determined fight against crime and corruption, keep serving the public and will not be deterred by any attempt to weaken it,  the statement said. the two investigations in which netanyahu is a suspect are  known as case 1000 and case 2000. case 1000 revolves around gifts he received from businessmen, including cigars and champagne. netanyahu s lawyers say they were simply presents from long time friends, with no quid pro quo. case 2000 focuses on suspicions netanyahu negotiated with the publisher of israel s best selling newspaper for better coverage in return for curbs on the competition. the prime minister s lawyers say netanyahu never seriously considered any such deal.    netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him:  there will be nothing because there is nothing.   the prime minister is under no legal obligation to step down if indicted, but some political analysts predict he would opt for new elections to renew his public mandate if charged. all four prime ministers of the past two decades have been suspects in police investigations but only ehud olmert was charged and convicted. he spent 16 months in jail for accepting bribes from real estate developers.   in high profile cases such as these, police usually say if they have gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects, before handing over to the justice ministry, where the attorney general and prosecutors decide whether to file charges. mordechai kremnitzer, a law professor and vice president of the israel democracy institute, said netanyahu s governing coalition was abusing  the power of legislation  to try to extricate him from his legal problems.  this has set a record and reflects a complete loss of restraint and total shamelessness,  he said.

senior figures in the nld on monday joined the criticism of how the two men are being treated. nyan win, a member of the nld s central executive committee and one of suu kyi s defense lawyers during her years of house arrest under junta rule, said it was  unfair  that the families of wa lone and kyaw soe oo were not allowed to contact them or be told where they are being held. he said the police were being  very secretive  and called for  openness , although said the nld was unable to do anything about the issue as it was not being kept informed. although an nld led civilian government took office in april last year the police and home ministry, which are driving the case, remain under the control of the military. win htein, another senior figure in the nld, who was also critical of the journalists  detention, suggested they had probably been set up by the police.  in my opinion this is a trap,  he said.  they met with two policemen and then they were arrested somewhere else with the documents.  police lieutenant colonel myint htwe, of the yangon police division, had no comment when asked about the criticism of the men s detention. asked on mizzima television what he would do for the detained journalists, information minister pe myint said:  when i know all the facts of the current case, i will work to do what i can.  pe myint is a former editor of the people s age in yangon and was wa lone s boss when the journalist worked at the paper in his first job as a reporter. the two journalists had worked on reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 rohingya muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in western rakhine state. the ministry of information said last week that they had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media , and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs.   it said they were being investigated under the 1923 official secrets act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. the ministry said at the same time that two policemen, police captain moe yan naing and police sergeant khin maung lin, had also been arrested under the same act. no details have been released on whether a case against them is also proceeding.   the authorities have not allowed the journalists any contact with their families, a lawyer or reuters since their arrest. the international commission of jurists (icj) called on the authorities to immediately disclose the whereabouts of the pair.  all detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,  said frederick rawski, the icj s asia pacific regional director, in a statement on monday.   authorities are bound to respect these rights in line with myanmar law and the state s international law obligations.    police told wa lone s wife on thursday that the reporters were taken from htaunt kyant police station in north yangon to an undisclosed location by an investigation team shortly after their arrest.   they added the reporters would be brought back to the station in  two to three days at most . it is now six days since they were detained and there has been no further update on their whereabouts. lieutenant colonel myint htwe and a second senior officer, lieutenant colonel min han of the criminal investigation department, said on monday they did not know where the journalists were being held.  you don t need to worry for their safety,  said lt col myint htwe.  the investigative team will proceed according to the law.

" british foreign secretary boris johnson, setting aside his previous hostility toward donald trump, said on thursday the u.s. republican’s presidential election victory offered economic opportunities and there was no need for europeans to be despondent about it. “i may respectfully say to my european friends and colleagues that it’s time we snapped out of general doom and gloom about this election,” johnson said after meeting serbian prime minister aleksandar vucic.       “he is after all a deal maker. he wants to do a free trade deal with the uk,” johnson told reporters. trump’s upset victory over democrat hillary clinton has delighted far right politicians in france, the netherlands and austria but worried some mainstream politicians who fear it may be part of a populist, anti establishment trend. “i believe that this is a great opportunity for us in the uk to build on that relationship with america that is of fundamental economic importance for us but also of great importance for stability and prosperity in the world,” johnson said. johnson was one of the leading proponents of the successful brexit campaign to get britain out of the european union. trump aligned himself with the brexit movement during his campaign.    on wednesday, johnson, the former london mayor, congratulated trump on his victory and tweeted that he looked forward to continuing the partnership between the two nations. johnson said last year that he feared going to new york because of “the real risk of meeting donald trump” after the new york businessman said parts of london were now so radicalized that police officers feared to go there. later on thursday, johnson said on his twitter account he had spoken to u.s. vice president elect mike pence. “we agreed on importance of the special relationship & need to tackle global challenges together,” he tweeted.

" the philippines on monday announced the end of five months of military operations in a southern city held by pro islamic state rebels, after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that has marked the country s biggest security crisis in years. offensive combat operations were terminated after troops put a stop to the last stand of rebel gunmen who clung on inside several buildings in the heart of marawi, and refused to surrender. artillery and automatic gunfire were still heard on monday and reuters journalists saw flames behind a mosque. the bodies of 40 fighters and two of their wives were found there and in two buildings close by.  ernesto abella, spokesman for president rodrigo duterte, said the philippines had prevailed against  the most serious threat of violent extremism and radicalism in the philippines and in southeast asia .  defence secretary delfin lorenzana said the security forces had  nipped the budding infrastructure  of extremist groups.   in crushing thus far the most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism in the philippines and in the region, we have contributed to preventing its spread in asia,  lorenzana said in clark at a meeting of regional defense ministers. the rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that islamic state loyalists have gained influence among local muslims and have ambitions to use the island of mindanao as a base for operations in southeast asia. those fears are compounded by the organization of the militant alliance and its ability to recruit young fighters, lure foreign radicals, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure 154 days of ground offensive and air strikes. the authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. the center of the picturesque lakeside town is now in ruins due to heavy shelling and aerial bombing. the deputy task force commander in marawi, colonel romeo brawner, said troops would secure the city from militant  stragglers  who might still be alive.  if we find them and they will attack our soldiers or even the civilians, then we will have to defend ourselves,  he told reporters.    after months of slow progress, the military has made significant gains in retaking marawi in the week since isnilon hapilon, islamic state s  emir  in southeast asia and omarkhayam maute, a leader of the maute militant group, were killed in a nighttime operation. another leader and possible bankroller of the operation, malaysian mahmud ahmad, was likely killed also, the military said. military spokesman, major general restituto padilla, confirmed there was still gunfire ongoing, but there were  no more terrorists  and the army s last battles were with an enemy decimated by the loss of its leadership.  they were formless, they had no place to run,  he said.      duterte had declared marawi city liberated six days ago, even though fighting was not actually over. on sunday, he said it was important to be vigilant because no country could escape islamic state s  clutches of evil .  i m not trying to scare you, but let s just be prepared for any event,  he said. lorenzana said six battalions of troops would remain in marawi and though the battle had been won, the enemy s radical ideology had not been completely annihilated.  he thanked the united states, australia, singapore and china for providing weaponry and technical support, including surveillance aircraft, and said the conflict would be a catalyst for closer international cooperation against extremism. the government estimates the rebuilding of the heart of marawi could cost in excess of $1 billion.

" republican house speaker paul ryan has told confidants he would like to retire after the 2018 congressional elections, politico reported on thursday, but the wisconsin lawmaker and an aide played down the report, saying he wasn’t quitting any time soon. “ryan has made it known to some of his closest confidants that this will be his final term as speaker,” politico said.  politico said it interviewed three dozen people who knew ryan   including lawmakers, congressional and administration aides, conservative intellectuals and republican lobbyists   and that “not a single person believed ryan will stay in congress past 2018.” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said president donald trump had spoken to ryan “and made sure that the speaker knew very clearly and in no uncertain terms that if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it.” “the speaker assured the president that those were not accurate reports and that they looked forward to working together for a long time to come,” sanders said. ryan is a long time champion of tax reform who has helped bring republicans in congress to the cusp of a tax overhaul for the first time in a generation. if passed, it would be trump’s first major legislative victory since he took office in january despite being helped by republican control of congress. when asked by reporters on thursday if he was planning to quit, ryan said with a chuckle: “i’m not, no.” asked later about the politico report, ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong did not directly deny it, instead saying: “this is pure speculation. as the speaker himself said today, he’s not going anywhere any time soon.” ryan would be unlikely to publicize any planned departure because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the house of representatives. a budget hawk who was mitt romney’s vice presidential running mate in 2012, ryan reluctantly took over as speaker in 2015 following the resignation of john boehner, who had held the post since early 2011 after republicans won control of the chamber from democrats. boehner’s tenure as speaker was marked by fractious divisions among competing groups within the republican party. ryan has tried to move the party beyond those disputes with only limited success.  party divisions earlier this year prevented republicans from delivering a promised overhaul of healthcare legislation, and the path toward tax reform has also been complicated by internal  disagreements and intense lobbying from industry groups.

" britain s queen elizabeth praised the resilience of london and manchester after  appalling attacks , in a christmas message that also paid tribute to her husband, prince philip, who retired from regular royal duties this year. the  powerful identities  of the capital and the northern english city had shone through after militant attacks as well as a devastating fire that destroyed the residential tower block grenfell tower in london, the queen said. the 91 year old monarch, whose televised address is an essential part of a traditional christmas in britain, said it had been a privilege to visit victims of the bomb attack at a pop concert in manchester, as she was able to witness the bravery and resilience of survivors first hand. on the 60th anniversary of her first televised christmas address, elizabeth said her reflections on the year had made her   grateful for the blessings of home and family , and praised her husband and his  unique  sense of humor. the 96 year old prince, also known as the duke of edinburgh, has been at the queen s side throughout her 65 years on the throne, and has often grabbed the headlines with his off color comments. elizabeth, the world s longest reigning monarch, celebrated her platinum wedding anniversary in november. philip retired from regular royal duties over the summer having carried out more than 22,000 solo engagements.  i don t know that anyone had invented the term  platinum  for a 70th wedding anniversary when i was born. you weren t expected to be around that long,  she said.   even prince philip has decided it s time to slow down a little   having, as he economically put it,  done his bit . but i know his support and unique sense of humor will remain as strong as ever.      philip has continued to make occasional appearances, and joined other members of the royal family at a christmas day church service on their country estate in sandringham. also joining them for the service was prince harry s fiancee meghan markle who is spending christmas with the royals. the american actress wore a distinctive brown hat as she arrived alongside the queen s grandson harry, his elder brother william and his wife kate.  as they left, both couples briefly chatted to some well wishers who had gathered to glimpse the royals on christmas morning. the queen, who missed last year s service with a heavy cold, said in her address that she was looking forward to welcoming new members into the royal family next year. as well as markle, who will marry harry in may, kate is expecting a third child. the royal christmas broadcast dates back to king george v in 1932 when it was on the radio. it was first televised in 1957.

" if democrats thought it was hard to stop president donald trump’s first u.s. supreme court nominee, it promises to be even tougher for them if he gets to fill another vacancy, potentially to replace the most influential justice, anthony kennedy. kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court’s liberals in key cases such as on gay rights and abortion, is one of three justices 78 or older. justice stephen breyer is 78 and fellow liberal ruth bader ginsburg is 84. former kennedy supreme court clerks said the justice, who turns 81 in july, may be pondering retirement either this year or in 2018. that would give trump a further chance to shape the court after his first nominee, neil gorsuch, was sworn in on monday for the lifetime job to replace the late conservative justice antonin scalia after overcoming fierce democratic opposition in the senate confirmation process. kennedy administered gorsuch’s judicial oath at a white house ceremony, and trump heaped praise on a justice who has spent nearly three decades on america’s top court, calling him “a great man of outstanding accomplishment.” gorsuch is one of kennedy former clerks. kennedy is planning a reunion of his clerks in june rather than next year as had been expected. kennedy, through a court spokesman, declined to comment on his plans. the implications for the court if kennedy were to step down are enormous. for the past decade he been its swing vote in major cases. gorsuch’s confirmation restored the court’s 5 4 conservative majority. if whenever kennedy leaves the bench he is replaced by a stalwart conservative, that would move the court further to the right. republicans possess a 52 48 majority in the senate. in order to secure gorsuch’s confirmation, they voted to prohibit a procedural roadblock called a filibuster that had required a super majority of 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote for supreme court nominees, leaving the minority democrats with little ammunition for the next nomination fight. “i think it will be very hard for democrats to get much traction to derail a future trump nominee without the threat of a filibuster,” george washington university political scientist sarah binder said. but democrats and republicans still are predicting a fierce fight over the next court vacancy. “for the life of me i don’t understand why the democrats made such a fuss about this one. they look stupid,” republican senator orrin hatch said last week of gorsuch’s nomination. “i expect armageddon on the next one because that’s going to change, assuming trump gets another one, the direction of the court. it would certainly keep the court in a more conservative mode for a long time.” a democratic congressional aide added, “the opposition to gorsuch could look weak compared to what a similarly conservative nominee would face, if it would tip the balance on the court.”  kennedy is the longest serving of the nine justices. he was nominated by republican president ronald reagan in 1987 and confirmed by the senate in 1988 after democrats thwarted reagan’s first choice, outspoken conservative robert bork, and his second pick, douglas ginsburg, withdrew from consideration. although he has sided with his conservative colleagues on many issues, kennedy has supported liberal causes such as gay rights, culminating in writing the landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same sex marriage nationwide. he also joined the liberals in upholding abortion rights. in 2016, kennedy joined the court’s four liberal justices in a ruling striking down a texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of u.s. abortion rights in more than two decades. he also authored a 2016 ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions, joined by the court’s liberals. university of georgia school of law professor lori ringhand said republicans may be wary of defending an extremely conservative court nominee with the midterm congressional elections coming up in 2018, if another vacancy arises. “it’s not clear it would be to the electoral advantage to republicans to have a hotly contested supreme court nomination right before the midterms that highlighted a nominee’s extremely conservative positions on social issues that the majority of the public have actually accepted,” ringhand said.

"no matter which candidate you support, this moment on the campaign trail is pretty awesome. trump has said he wants to support our veterans in a big way if elected. he showed he s a man of his word when he plucked a veteran from the crowd and hired her. instead of his catchphrase  you re fired,  mr. trump told the previously homeless black woman,  you re hired. just when you think the 2016 presidential race can t get more surreal, donald trump reprised his role from the hit realty tv show  the apprentice  at washington press conference monday and plucked an unemployed veteran out of the audience for an impromptu job interview.it was yet another unexpected twist in mr. trump s unconventional run that has defied the pundits, confounded the gop establishment and made him the front-runner for the republican presidential nomination.mr. trump summoned the washington press corps to the under-construction trump international hotel on pennsylvania avenue, just blocks from the white house. he said the one way or another he s coming to the nation s capital.the billionaire businessman boasted that the hotel, which is being refurbished from the city s historic old post office building, was being restored to the  highest level,  with luxurious suites and the largest ballroom in washington.he said the hotel would open ahead of schedule and under budget in september.when hands went up from reporters gathered in the cavernous atrium where the hotel lobby was being built, mr. trump called on alicia watkins. here s the encounter between trump and ms. watkins: ms. watkins, 38, a former air force staff sergeant who survived the 9/11 attack on the pentagon and served in iraq and afghanistan, was at the press conference as a freelance writer working on an article about jobs for veterans.she briefly described her situation and complimented mr. trump s stance of expanding employment opportunities for veterans, and then asked if the hotel would be part of a jobs program. we are doing some of that. what are you looking for, what kind of position,  mr. trump asked, and then invited her to come to the podium.pleased with her response, mr. trump directed her to one of his company s executives to work out a employment deal. if we can make a good deal on the salary, she s going to probably have this job,  said the real estate tycoon.asked why he did the on-the-spot job interview, mr. trump said that he  felt good about her. it s a gut instinct,  he said.  i have instincts about people. read more of this incredible story at: washington times ",1

" an expelled student shot dead six of his former schoolmates and a security guard at his school in northern kenya on saturday, and was then himself lynched by a furious mob, officials said. the attack took place at a school in the remote town of lokichogio in kenya s turkana region, close to the border with war torn south sudan. at least six other students were flown to hospital with bullet wounds. the assailant was a 17 year old from south sudan   one of thousands of refugee children who have been living in kenya and going to school there since civil war broke out in their country in 2013. he was detained in possession of an ak 47, the basic assault rifle of choice in conflicts across africa and the middle east.   the school was not attacked by bandits but an errant student on expulsion for disciplinary cases,  regional government official wanyama musyambohe told reporters. security officials said the assailant, whose name has not been disclosed, had been arrested, but then killed by a mob while in police custody.  the attack ... is a painful reminder of the state of insecurity along the border,  tweeted turkana county governor josphat nanok. close to 2 million people have fled south sudan since fighting broke out in december 2013, sparking what has become africa s largest cross border exodus since the 1994 rwandan genocide. some 75,000 of them are now in kenya. perennial conflicts have left the region awash with arms, which are smuggled across borders with relative ease.

" democrats on a congressional panel say members of its republican majority are trying to sabotage an investigation into suspected russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election, raising concerns the two parties will reach contradictory conclusions. republicans on the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee have coached witnesses, scheduled interviews without first requesting important documents, and many fail to attend witness interviews, four sources close to the investigation said. on one occasion, three sources said, republican representative trey gowdy told jared kushner, president donald trump’s son in law and white house aide, that he was testifying voluntarily and could leave whenever he liked. after about two and a half hours, one of the sources said, kushner took the cue and left before democrats had finished questioning him. kushner’s lawyer and gowdy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  the panel has heard from about 10 witnesses, the sources said. but given the lack of preparation and the absence of many republican members, hearings amount to “going through the motions” rather than a serious investigation, one source said.     two republican committee staffers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also criticized what they called a partisan effort to discredit rather than investigate allegations that some aides or advisers to republican trump’s election campaign may have colluded with russia, which has been under u.s. sanctions for several years. the conduct of the probe so far, those staffers and other sources said, threatens to undermine the committee’s reputation for bipartisanship under former republican chairman mike rogers, who led the committee from 2011 to 2015. representative jackie speier, a california democrat, said that while she would like to believe the panel “will come together unified in its conclusions and submit a joint report, i’m not overly optimistic that this will be the case.” another committee democrat, representative eric swalwell, said, “that is our north star, unity and consensus on what happened. now along the way we’ve seen disruptive behavior that has i think impeded our investigation, and despite that we still are doggedly trying to find out what happened.” asked for comment, jack langer, a spokesman for republican committee chairman, representative devin nunes, said in a statement: “with this article, reuters is acting as a loyal, obedient stenographer of the democrats’ utterly baseless complaints.” langer did not respond to reuters’ request to address  specific complaints made by the democrats. democratic members and staffers on the committee have said nothing publicly about the republicans’ possible motives for fear of destroying any chance to produce a bipartisan report, four sources said. democrats said that the republicans appear to want to undermine the credibility of fusion gps, a political research firm that commissioned former british spy christopher steele to produce a dossier on trump while he was running for president. investigators are attempting to confirm or dismiss the contents of steele’s dossier, which outlined russian financial and personal links to trump’s campaign and associates. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign of hacking and propaganda to undermine faith in the u.s. election, denigrate democratic nominee hillary clinton, and help trump. the kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations. trump disputes he and his associates colluded with moscow, calling probes by congress and a special counsel a “witch hunt.” panel chairman nunes, a trump ally, was forced to step aside  from leading the probe in april after the house ethics committee said it was investigating allegations that he disclosed classified information without authorization. democrats on the committee praise representative mike conaway, the republican who took nunes’ place leading the investigation. nevertheless, nunes is investigating fusion gps and steele on his own. on oct. 10, nunes subpoenaed the firm’s partners, a source familiar with the matter said. sources familiar with the origins of the dossier said steele received no money for his work on it from any russian entity or person or from the fbi. it has been widely reported that supporters of republican jeb bush, one of trump’s opponents for the party’s  presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by clinton supporters.     the house and senate intelligence committees, created in the aftermath of u.s. spy scandals exposed in the 1970s, have long traditions of avoiding partisan feuds. three sources familiar with the house committee’s workings said democrats had requested a meeting of all members to resolve  differences, but the republicans rejected the idea. if the rift cannot be healed, the sources said, the democrats could write their own report and seek to associate it with what is expected to be a bipartisan senate intelligence committee report. representative adam schiff, the house committee’s top democrat, wrote in the washington post last weekend that he still hoped members could arrive at a common conclusion. “this remains my hope   not consistency for the sake of consistency, or at the cost of incomplete work, but in the service of a public that has too often been forced to choose between competing narratives of the same events,” schiff wrote.

" u.s. senator jeff flake said on wednesday he expects more  republican colleagues to speak out against donald trump’s behavior and policies, one day after denouncing the republican president in a fiery speech. flake had accused trump of “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and said his “instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward looking people.” his condemnation in a speech on the senate floor came just hours after senator bob corker, another republican, lashed out at trump as “an utterly untruthful president” who was debasing the united states. flake, who is not seeking re election in arizona next year, said on wednesday he thinks other republican lawmakers will join him in standing up to trump. “privately a number of my colleagues have expressed concern about the direction of our politics and the behavior of the president,” flake told cnn. “there comes a tipping point where you realize we just can’t continue to normalize this kind of behavior so i do think we’ll have more people stand up in the coming months.” trump responded by saying flake’s feud with him probably would have cost him with voters and that he would have lost if he had sought re election. “he was against me before he ever knew me,” trump told reporters on wednesday. “he would have never won. he did the smart thing for himself. this way he can get out somewhat gracefully.” despite control of the white house, the senate and the house of representatives, republicans have yet to deliver any major legislative victories this year on priorities such as tax reform, healthcare and immigration. republican senator john mccain, who is fighting brain cancer, also has spoken out sharply against trump.  but most republicans in congress have either remained silent or tried to play down divisions inside their party as trump has attacked lawmakers, the media and others he sees as opposing or trying to undermine his presidency. “i think people should settle their differences personally,” republican house speaker paul ryan told reuters in an interview on wednesday. “i think it’s better that way. i think it’s in our interest to have party unity so that we can continue to work forward on an agenda.” so far, the fierce criticism from flake and corker has drawn more praise from democrats than from fellow republicans. “history will judge senator flake and senator corker as two men of the greatest conscience to have graced this chamber on either side of the aisle in a long time,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer said.

" the meeting between u.s. president donald trump’s son and a russian attorney, and the failure to disclose it, add new urgency to the push to pass a russian sanctions bill that has been stalled in congress, lawmakers and aides said on tuesday. “what happened with donald trump jr. just underscores how russia was operating,” said senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. cardin said the bill should have been passed because of russian interference in last year’s u.s. elections, occupation of parts of ukraine and georgia and support of the syrian government. the senate backed the sanctions legislation by 98 2 on june 15 but it has been stuck in the house of representatives, amid partisan squabbling between republicans and democrats. trump’s relationship with russia has been in particularly sharp focus this month because he had his first meeting last week with russian president vladimir putin. some democrats had accused trump’s fellow republicans of stalling the sanctions package at least until after that meeting, to please the president. republicans denied that. house republican leaders initially rejected the bill for procedural reasons, prompting the senate to tweak it. but democrats then objected to a change by the senate that they said weakened the bill by making it more difficult for the house to vote on any change in sanctions policy by trump. ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan, said democrats still were objecting to moving the bill in its current form. but both republican and democratic house aides said talks between the two parties were continuing and there was a decent chance for a quick compromise, more so because of the latest revelations about trump’s eldest son. donald trump jr. eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he believed was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic white house nominee hillary clinton, as part of moscow’s official support for his father, according to emails released on tuesday. “it certainly does not help the administration at this point,” a senior republican house aide said. steny hoyer, the no. 2 house democrat, predicted that the matter would be cleared up quickly and brought to the floor for a vote this week. the russia package, written as an amendment to an iran sanctions bill, puts into law sanctions previously established through presidential executive order, including some on russian energy projects and debt financing. it also imposes sanctions on russians convicted of human rights abuses or cyber attacks and would allow new sanctions on russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. trump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers to argue against some parts of the bill, including the requirement that trump obtain congress’ permission before easing any sanctions. they also objected to the fact that many of the sanctions are mandatory, meaning trump could not waive them for national security reasons. “this is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told a daily briefing. but many of trump’s fellow republicans said they wanted to move ahead nonetheless to send a strong message to russia. “any administration would prefer to conduct foreign policy 100 percent without involvement by congress. that’s just the way life is,” said senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee. ed royce, the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, will introduce his own russia sanctions legislation in the house if the senate bill remains stalled, a source familiar with his thinking said. royce’s thinking was first reported by politico.

" the trump administration’s budget proposal would convert some of the united states’ foreign military grants to loans, part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy, aid and programs abroad by more than 29 percent, the white house said on monday. the cuts to programs under the state department are in part meant to fund an increase in military spending. the white house budget documents showed total defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year at $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than president barack obama’s proposed 2018 fiscal year defense budget. the $603 billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the department of energy and other national defense programs as well as the department of defense.  the pentagon’s specific defense request is for $574.5 billion, an increase of 4.6 percent compared to fiscal year 2017. under president donald trump’s proposal, the united states would spend 29.1 percent less on the state department and “other international programs” in the 2018 fiscal year compared to 2017, a decrease of $11.5 billion. that decrease includes a re shaping of the way some countries receive military aid from the united states. foreign military financing gives countries loans or grants to buy u.s. military equipment. the state department decides which countries are given the financing while the pentagon executes the decisions. under the trump proposal, many current grants would instead be converted to loans. “we do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans,” said mick mulvaney, the director of the white house office of management and budget, in a briefing with reporters on monday. “our argument was instead of ... giving somebody $100 million, we could give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they could actually buy more stuff.” military aid to israel and egypt, two close u.s. allies in the middle east and the biggest recipients of u.s. military assistance, will remain unchanged, mulvaney said. the wall street journal, which first reported the proposal, said the foreign military grants could affect pakistan, tunisia, lebanon, ukraine, colombia, the philippines and vietnam. u.s. military assistance to partners and allies reached $13.5 billion in 2015, or 28 percent of all u.s. foreign aid spending that year, according to the congressional research service. most grants through the foreign military financing (fmf) program go to israel, egypt, jordan, pakistan and iraq. congress ultimately controls the government purse strings and may reject some or many of the trump administration’s proposals. republicans and democrats in congress have criticized the size of the cuts to the state department and u.s. agency for international development. mulvaney said that aid to pakistan would be reduced, though he did not give concrete details. “(the) state (department) still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that, but i do know that writ large we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program,” he said. todd harrison, a defense budget analyst with the center for strategic and budgetary assessments, said the switch from grants to loans for military aid may mean that countries will not be able to afford u.s. military equipment, forcing them to go elsewhere for supplies. “countries can buy from china or russia. they have other places to shop, and one of the ways that we build capacity with our partners is through these grants,” harrison said. “it’s in our interest to have interoperability with our allies, and these military grants are a part of that.” thomas spoehr, who directs the center for national defense at the conservative heritage foundation, said the conversion from grants to loans will be a challenge especially for smaller military aid recipient countries like macedonia and tunisia.     but “it’s a proposal whose time has come,” spoehr said, given u.s. budget deficits and high military spending overall.     “this is probably a prudent place to make some cuts given all the other investments we make in national defense,” spoehr said.

" when the u.s. supreme court on monday takes up a challenge brought by texas and other states to president barack obama’s executive action on immigration, the eight justices face a series of legal questions beginning with whether texas and the other state challengers even have grounds to bring the case.  obama’s november 2014 orders affect immigrants in the country illegally whose children are u.s. citizens or lawful permanent residents or who themselves have been in the united states since they were children.  here is a look at some of the key legal questions in the case:  legal standing to bring a case, challengers must first demonstrate that they have legal “standing,” arising from some injury or negative consequences. in this case, that means the states need to show that they would be hurt by the obama administration’s deferral of deportation for immigrant parents and children with deep ties to the united states but who are in the country illegally.  the state of texas has taken the lead in the lawsuit against the obama administration to block the president’s actions. texas asserts that it has standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants with new authorization to live in the united states.  texas subsidizes the cost of processing driver’s licenses and contends obama’s actions would cost it millions of dollars. the obama administration rejects that basis for standing to file suit, asserting that any such costs are “incidental” and could be avoided by the state. obama administration lawyers say texas could eliminate the subsidies for these driver’s licenses and eliminate the harm claimed by the state.  if a majority of the justices finds that texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue, the case of united states v. texas ends there and the obama administration wins.  rule making requirements if the justices agree that texas has standing to bring the case, they then would consider whether deferred deportation policies that were part of obama’s actions violated rule making requirements in a federal law called the administrative procedure act. under that law, federal agencies typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested parties a chance to comment.  obama administration lawyers say the deferred deportation practices are not binding rules subject to the administrative procedure act. rather, they characterize these policies as an outgrowth of the u.s. department of homeland security’s discretion in determining deportation priorities.  the administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his department's limited resources on deporting serious criminals and securing the border.  ’take care’ a final possible question for the justices is whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the u.s. constitution that presidents must “take care” to “faithfully execute” the nation’s laws.  texas and the other states that brought the lawsuit say obama, in taking executive action that bypassed congress, crossed that line because congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant.  the obama administration says it was faithfully executing the authority to determine priorities under immigration law.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on wednesday in the trump administration’s latest move to reduce regulations. oil interest groups, including the american petroleum institute and the texas oil and gas association, had petitioned the epa a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  the epa said in a statement that it would delay the rule’s june 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. under democratic president barack obama, the epa released the first methane limits on the facilities in may 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  scott pruitt, the epa chief in the administration of republican president donald trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil producing oklahoma. pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  michelle robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists, said epa was favoring industry over science. “instead of looking backwards to review well reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,” and extend methane limits, she said.  wednesday’s move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the trump administration in march halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. in late march, trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  pruitt said the epa is continuing to follow through with trump’s order. “american businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,” he said.

" a u.s. congressional proposal that would eliminate income tax exemptions for certain airlines could affect major gulf carriers, potentially worsening an international spat between u.s. airlines and their middle east rivals. u.s. airlines have been petitioning the federal government for years to intervene in what they see as unfair competition by the three major gulf carriers.    the proposal, tucked deep in the senate tax cut plan, calls for airlines headquartered in foreign countries to pay the u.s. incorporate tax rate if: 1) the carrier’s home country does not have an income tax treaty with the united states and 2) the carrier’s country of origin has fewer than two arrivals and departures, per week, operated by major u.s. airlines.  airways, emirates [emira.ul] and etihad airways have for years been accused by u.s. competitors of being illegally subsidized by their governments. the gulf carriers deny the accusation. they could not immediately be reached for comment on thursday. if the proposal passes, it could leave the gulf carriers more vulnerable because their home countries – the united arab emirates and qatar – do not have income tax treaties with the united states, according to the internal revenue service website. a number of nations could possibly also be affected at a time when perceived discrepancies in u.s. trade agreements are facing a critical eye from u.s. corporations and the federal government.       the language in the senate proposal sets the stage for a crackdown in tax leniency for these and other airlines. this would likely be well received by american carriers, which have for years petitioned the u.s. government to intervene in the dispute. under u.s. tax treaties, entities of foreign countries are either exempt or pay a reduced rate on their income, and vice versa for u.s. entities abroad. reciprocity agreements, however, are less formal deals that fall short of an official accord, according to tax attorney sam brotman of brotman law. “reciprocity agreements are usually with countries that are not necessarily 100 percent friendly with the u.s.” brotman said on thursday. “we’ll call it a handshake deal.” the bill’s wording stands to ramp up an already tense battle between u.s. airlines and gulf carriers.  the addition was introduced by u.s. senator johnny isakson of georgia. delta air lines (dal.n), one of the most vocal critics of gulf carrier practices, is headquartered in atlanta.  a spokeswoman for isakson did not mention the gulf airlines.    “this provision supports american jobs by providing a level playing field and mutual fairness in international passenger aviation,” isakson spokeswoman marie gordon said in an email on thursday.  “foreign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to u.s. companies.” delta declined to comment.

" leaders of the u.s. senate intelligence committee said on wednesday the issue of whether president donald trump s 2016 election campaign colluded with russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe into the matter. republican chairman richard burr and democratic vice chairman mark warner also warned about the risk to future u.s. elections posed by russia, including what is expected to be a closely contested election next month for governor of warner s home state, virginia. burr told reporters the committee plans to conduct 25 more interviews with witnesses this month, but described his goal of finishing this year the main congressional investigation into russian meddling as only  aspirational  at this point.  the issue of collusion is still open,  burr said, standing alongside warner at a press conference to provide an update on the investigation.  we have not come to any determination on collusion,  he said. burr said he wanted very much to conclude the investigation before the height of campaigning for november 2018 u.s. mid term elections, when all 435 seats in the house of representatives and one third of the 100 seat senate will be up for grabs. warner said the united states needed a  whole of government  approach to combating interference with u.s. elections.  the russian active measures efforts did not end on election day, 2016,  he said.  trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in january. a special counsel appointed by the justice department, robert mueller, is conducting a separate probe that could lead to criminal charges. russia denies meddling. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia interfered in the election to try to help trump defeat democratic candidate hillary clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. burr said the committee agreed with the intelligence community s conclusion that russia had interfered.  the committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,  burr said.  now, i m not even going to discuss initial findings because we haven t any. we ve got a tremendous amount of documents still to go through.  he said the panel has conducted more than 100 interviews lasting more than 250 hours in its nine month old probe, and  we currently have booked for the balance of this month 25 additional interviews.  those who have already come before committee members or investigators include the president s son in law and adviser jared kushner, former trump campaign manager paul manafort, and social media executives such as officials from twitter inc (twtr.n).  on wednesday, a representative for kushner and ivanka trump denied a report in usa today that the couple had re routed personal emails through their family s business. among witnesses who will appear at future public committee hearings are trump s personal attorney, michael cohen, and executives from facebook inc (fb.o), twitter and alphabet inc s (googl.o) google. warner and burr urged american election officials and political campaigns to take the threat of russian interference seriously.  you can t walk away from this and believe that russia s not currently active in trying to create chaos in our election process. and i assume that the same tactics that you saw in montenegro, in france, in belgium and in the united states will continue to be tested within our structure of the election process,  burr said. burr said the committee has  hit a wall  in its investigation of a former british spy s explosive dossier on purported russian support for trump s 2016 campaign. former mi6 officer christopher steele compiled the dossier, which trump was told by former fbi director james comey contained salacious material about the businessman turned president. trump and his associates have called the dossier s contents false.  we have, on several occasions, made attempts to contact mr. steele, to meet with mr. steele,  burr said.  those offers have gone unaccepted. the committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub sources,  burr added.

" the trump organization has no plans to build in buenos aires, a spokeswoman told reuters on tuesday, ending speculation a new trump office tower would soon appear near the landmark obelisk in the heart of argentina’s capital.  the city government said in late november it had declined to authorize a permit to build an office tower linked to the u.s. president elect, clarifying that developers would have to file new paperwork for it to be reconsidered. the “trump tower” project made international headlines after a local news report that trump mentioned the proposed office complex when argentine president mauricio macri put in a congratulatory call to him after his nov. 8 election.  the macri administration said the report was untrue and that the project was not mentioned during the call. macri knew trump from his days working as a businessman but had said before the election he preferred democrat hillary clinton.   “there are no plans to build in buenos aires,” said the trump organization spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. trump, a businessman who has never held public office, has real estate and leisure holdings all over the world, sparking concerns his investments could color his decision making after he becomes president on jan. 20.  he has said he will remove himself from day to day business operations before taking office, avoiding potential conflicts of interest by transferring control of his businesses to his three eldest children. his company pulled out of a hotel venture in rio de janeiro last month. developers yy development group, which built a nearly completed trump tower at the punta del este resort in uruguay, told the argentine paper la nacion this week that the buenos aires project had been called off for now. the buenos aires city government said in november the trump project first surfaced in early 2007 when a firm identified as kubic s.a. filed a building request for a plot of land now used as a downtown parking lot. the plan was approved, but expired when construction did not begin within a stipulated three year period, the city’s statement said. last august, the city said, a firm called repetto oeste sa sought to revive the 2007 plan, but the request was not authorized.

" senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on wednesday held firm on his refusal to act on president barack obama’s nominee to the u.s. supreme court even as some conservative activists called on senators to confirm merrick garland now that donald trump is the presumptive republican presidential nominee. “the leader’s position has not changed on garland,” mcconnell spokesman david popp told reuters. since obama nominated garland in march, mcconnell has refused to allow a confirmation vote, saying it should be up to the next president to fill the court’s vacancy left by the february death of conservative justice antonin scalia. some conservatives on wednesday urged the senate to confirm garland, a centrist federal appeals court judge, now that trump appears in line to win the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election. they are concerned democratic front runner hillary clinton will defeat trump in the election and pick a far more liberal nominee than garland for a lifetime court appointment. other conservative voices urged mcconnell to hold firm, saying that doing otherwise would alienate core republican voters, hurting the party’s election chances in the fall. senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley, who backs mcconnell’s hard line stance, has refused to hold hearings on garland’s nomination. with his victory in tuesday’s indiana republican primary, trump solidified his position to land the party’s presidential nomination at its july convention in cleveland. his closest challenger, texas senator ted cruz, quit the race after being drubbed in indiana. mcconnell has repeatedly refused to say which republican he supports for president. in an interview with newsmax on monday, before the indiana vote, mcconnell would say only that he intends to support the party’s nominee, “whomever that may be.” trump has said he would consult with the conservative heritage foundation think tank on possible supreme court nominees if he is elected president. leon wolf of the conservative redstate website predicted that republicans will lose the white house race in november with trump as their nominee, and likely lose control of the senate as well. wolf wrote in a blog post, “the choices, essentially, are to confirm garland ... or watch as president clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and 10 15 years younger” than the 63 year old garland. but erick erickson, writing for the conservative website the resurgent, said republicans should “resist the temptation” because rushing to confirm garland might “further depress republican (voter) turnout” that is important to keeping the senate under republican control.

" the white house on friday said there was no plan to utilize the national guard to round up unauthorized immigrants, after a news report asserted that the proposal had been under consideration by the trump administration. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters he couldn’t categorically say the move had never been discussed anywhere in the administration. the associated press reported the proposal to mobilize up to 100,000 national guard troops was part of a draft memo being circulated at the department of homeland security. spicer sharply criticized the report. “there is no effort at all to ... utilize the national guard to round up illegal immigrants,” he said. “this is 100 percent not true.” david lapan, a spokesman for dhs, said the department was “not considering mobilizing the national guard for immigration enforcement.” the ap said the draft memo, dated jan. 25, had been circulating among dhs staff for about two weeks and was addressed to the then acting heads of the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement and u.s. customs and border protection. it reported the 11 page document called for an unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement on the states bordering mexico   california, arizona, new mexico and texas   and also encompassed seven states contiguous to those four —  oregon, nevada, utah, colorado, oklahoma, arkansas and louisiana. the ap said the memo was meant to serve as guidance to implement the wide ranging executive order on immigration and border security that president donald trump signed on jan. 25. a dhs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the memorandum obtained by the associated press was an “early, early version” of a document being prepared by staff for homeland security secretary john kelly. discussion of the national guard was dropped before the memo ever made it to kelly’s desk, the official said. the memo being prepared for kelly has not yet been finalized but is expected to be finished soon, the official said.

" north korea has ratcheted up international tension and fear with its sixth and largest nuclear test on sunday, but south koreans feel increasingly doubtful it would start a war, a poll showed on friday. a gallup korea survey found that 58 percent of south koreans felt there was no possibility north korea will cause a war, while 37 percent said they thought it would. gallup korea began asking south koreans the question in 1992, and the percentage of respondents this time who thought the north would not start a war was the second highest since then. in the first poll in 1992, 69 percent of those questioned thought the north would start a war while only 24 percent thought it would not. the survey released on friday showed south koreans were considerably less concerned about war compared with june 2007, nine months after north korea conducted its first nuclear test, in september 2006. in 2007, 51 percent of respondents said they expected a war, while 45 percent did not. north korea says it needs to develop weapons to protect itself against u.s. aggression. it has been steadily pursuing its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international condemnation and has threatened more action in response to any new u.n. sanctions and u.s. pressure. despite the north s fiery rhetoric, south koreans are generally calm, going about their lives with no sign of panic.  the survey results show south koreans have likely grown accustomed to its repeated threats of provocation after over 60 years in a ceasefire state,  gallup korea said in a statement. south korea and the united states are technically still at war with north korea after the 1950 53 korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. the poll also found that 60 percent of those surveyed believed south korea should arm itself with nuclear weapons while 35 percent disagreed.  those in their twenties were most opposed to the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons, while respondents 50 and above said the south should have them. gallup also said 59 percent of respondents were against the idea of the united states attacking north korea first should north korean provocations continue, while 33 percent said it should. gallup korea said the poll was carried out from sept. 5 to 7. a total of 1,004 south koreans over the age of 19 were polled by telephone, it said.  the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

" saudi arabia said on monday that a u.s. law allowing citizens to sue the kingdom over the sept. 11 2001 attacks represented a threat to international relations and urged congress to act to prevent any dangerous consequences from the new legislation. the cabinet, at its weekly meeting in the capital riyadh, also said that the law, known as jasta, represented a violation of a leading principle preventing lawsuits against governments that regulated international relations for hundreds of years. “weakening this sovereign immunity will affect all countries, including the united states,” the statement by saudi information minister adel al toraifi, carried by saudi state news agency spa, said. “(the cabinet) expressed hope that wisdom will prevail and that the u.s. congress would take the necessary steps to avoid the bad and dangerous consequences that may result from the jasta legislation,” it added. the u.s. senate and house of representatives voted overwhelmingly last wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the united states to seek damages from the saudi government. fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals.    riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of islamist militant group al qaeda.  riyadh is one of washington’s longest standing and most important allies in the middle east and part of a u.s. led coalition fighting islamic state militants in iraq and syria. the saudi government lobbied strongly against jasta, which stands for the justice against sponsors of terrorism act,  in the run up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. but saudi officials stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed.

" u.s. senators called on president barack obama’s administration on friday to impose targeted sanctions on officials in the democratic republic of congo responsible for violence and rights violations amid rising political tensions. hoping to increase pressure on the government of president joseph kabila, three of obama’s fellow democrats, senators richard durbin, edward markey and christopher murphy, said on friday they had introduced a senate resolution this week calling on kabila’s government to fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power late this year. they called for targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, until kabila publicly commits to a peaceful transition of power. their action reflected growing international worry over the situation in the african nation. united nations secretary general ban ki moon on wednesday voiced concern about reports of rising political tension due to uncertainty about the presidential election.  dozens of kabila critics have been arrested since last year as part of what the united nations and rights groups say is an escalating crackdown on political dissent ahead of a presidential election scheduled for november. kabila is ineligible to stand for re election after serving two elected terms, but opponents accuse him of trying to delay the poll to hold onto power. congo’s highest court ruled last week that the president could stay in power if elections did not occur by the end of his mandate. on thursday, a protester and a police officer were killed in goma, in the eastern part of the country, during protests against a possible elections delay. the united nations said dozens of people were arrested. opposition leaders accuse kabila of stalling the vote in order to extend his 15 year rule, which the president denies. democratic congressional aides said they expected to add more co sponsors for the resolution after congress returns from its memorial day recess on june 6. there is bipartisan support for u.s. action to address the situation.  republican senator jeff flake, the chairman of the foreign relations committee’s africa subcommittee, told reuters in a brief interview this week that he felt sanctions would be appropriate and had discussed them with u.s. state department officials. “hopefully we’re together on this,” flake said. “i think we will be. we just want to make sure that whatever we do, pushes in the right direction.” ",0
" the u.s. congress approved a stop gap funding bill on wednesday that averts a looming federal government shutdown and provides urgently needed money to help battle an outbreak of the zika virus. passage of the bipartisan legislation came shortly after republicans and democrats ended a months long fight over whether washington should provide aid to the city of flint, michigan, as it struggles with a crisis over contaminated drinking water. separate legislation was approved by the house of representatives earlier in the day setting aid for flint. it must now be reconciled with a somewhat different bill passed by the senate.   the house voted 342 85 in a late night session on wednesday to approve stop gap funding to keep the u.s. government operating from oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, until dec. 9, when lawmakers will attempt to approve longer term money. with existing funds due to expire on saturday, house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers said the legislation “is a last resort, but at this point it is what we must do ... to keep the lights on in our government.” the senate voted 72 26 earlier on wednesday to adopt the short term spending bill. besides providing money to keep the government operating, the legislation also contains $1.1 billion to battle the zika virus that has hit puerto rico hard and spread to u.s. states, most notably florida. the disease can cause severe birth defects. funds would be used to develop a vaccine and reduce zika exposure. the bill also includes $500 million for flood relief in louisiana and other states. in a series of carefully orchestrated maneuvers after the senate approved the temporary funding, the house passed a wide ranging water resources bill containing $170 million to assist flint by a vote of 399 25. democrats have demanded action on the crisis, which stems from dangerous levels of lead in flint’s drinking water. a senate version of the bill contains $220 million for flint and other cities with problem water systems. the two chambers will have to hammer out compromise legislation after the nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. wednesday’s flurry of activity in congress came as lawmakers rushed to recess this week until after the elections.        conservative groups urged congress to defeat the funding bill. however, with house and senate members facing an imminent deadline for approving new money and lawmakers eager to go home to campaign for re election, the measure moved quickly through congress on wednesday. the white house said it was disappointed that the temporary funding bill continued a provision barring the securities and exchange commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies’ political spending. it also expressed disappointment that congress failed to take steps to ensure that the export import bank was able to fully operate its loan guarantee programs. nevertheless, president barack obama is expected to sign the bill into law.

" u.n. agencies said on monday they were trying to provide urgent help to large numbers of migrants held and then stranded in the smuggling hub of sabratha as rival factions battled for control of the city. at least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and housing to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on friday, the international organization for migration (iom) said. the u.n. refugee agency, unhcr, said some 6,000 had been held at the informal sites. hundreds of migrants who had left sabratha arrived in zuwara, about 25 km (15 miles) to the west, on foot along the beach, said sadeeq al jayash, head of zuwara s emergency committee.  they come walking in groups ... for example there were various groups that came on sunday   50, then 100 and 200 at night,  said jayash. there were about 1,700 migrants currently in zuwara  in desperate need of help , he said.  sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub saharan african migrants trying to cross the mediterranean by boat from libya.  but the number of crossings dropped sharply in july after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the u.n. backed government in tripoli to block departures, under pressure from italy and other european union member states. that set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions that left at least 43 dead and 340 wounded, according to a new health ministry toll, and ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. the migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.   we are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in sabratha,  othman belbeisi, iom libya chief of mission, said in a statement.    some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western libya that are nominally under the control of the tripoli government. iom officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.     alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in libya. in the meantime, iom continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,  belbeisi said.  local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the sabratha area. the head of sabratha s department for countering illegal migration told reuters on saturday that help was badly needed as some migrants had received no food or water for six days. the unhcr said it had approached libyan authorities to ensure that refugees among the migrants were freed from detention.

" the u.n. refugee agency has urged japan to resettle more asylum seekers, its chief said on monday, pressuring the country to  help solve a global crisis after giving refugee status to just three people in the first half of the year. japan is one of the developed world s least welcoming countries for asylum seekers. it accepted 28 in 2016, despite applications from a record 10,091 people. it has since 2008 given home to limited numbers of refugees through a so called third country resettlement scheme, resettling a total of 152 people   mostly ethnic karen people from myanmar living in thai and malaysian camps.  that program is very small, about 20 30 refugees a year,  u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi told a news conference in tokyo.  i have asked the government to consider whether it could be expanded.  japan s reluctance to accept refugees mirrors a wider caution towards immigration in a nation where many pride themselves on cultural and ethnic homogeneity.  its record at home has drawn sharp criticism from international human rights groups, and has been at odds with its traditional status as a major international donor on refugees.  but japan s donations to the unhcr have slipped: in the year to oct. 2, it was the fourth largest donor, giving $152 million, compared to the second largest four years ago.      contributions from the government to the unhcr have been declining a little bit every year since 2013,  grandi said.  what i asked the government to consider is that the needs of refugees and displaced people are increasing.  more than 2 million people fleeing wars or persecution have joined the ranks of the world s refugees this year. at the end of last year, the latest figure available, 17.2 million refugees fell under the unhcr s mandate. japan says that many people claim asylum in japan to find work, encouraged by access to renewable work permits for people applying for refugee status. it officially rejects unskilled migrant workers, even as a fast shrinking and ageing population blunts the potency of government efforts to rouse the economy from over two decades of sluggish growth and deflation. the justice ministry, which oversees refugee recognition, is weighing steps including restrictions on work permits for asylum seekers to curb what it deems  abusive  applications.

" marco rubio finished third in monday’s iowa caucuses, but his republican white house rivals are attacking him as though he were the victor, and on wednesday the u.s. senator from florida peppered his speech with humble caveats that seemed designed to deflect the hits. as the 2016 candidates looked ahead to tuesday’s new hampshire primary, new jersey governor chris christie has called rubio “the boy in the bubble,” suggesting he gives the same speech no matter where he goes. senator lindsey graham of south carolina, who is campaigning for former florida governor jeb bush, said rubio could not win a general election because of his positions on abortion and immigration. bush and ohio governor john kasich both said the country needed an experienced commander in chief, in what appeared to be a jab at rubio, a first term senator. in the run up to the iowa caucuses, republicans donald trump and ted cruz, two anti establishment candidates, had dominated the polls in the state while rubio lagged well behind. but on monday, he racked up a surprisingly strong third place finish, garnering the support of 23 percent of republican caucus goers, just below trump’s 24 percent second place finish. cruz, a senator from texas, won iowa with 28 percent. many pundits had predicted rubio would struggle to get much above 15 percent to 20 percent in the state. rubio struck a triumphant tone in his post caucus speech. “this is the moment they said would never happen,” he said, adding that the people of iowa had “sent a very clear message.” on wednesday, though, he gave a cautious outlook on his prospects in new hampshire and beyond. rubio said he was leaving his fate in the republican u.s. presidential primary contests in god’s hands, and added that he hoped his children would be proud of him “no matter how this turns out.” “i just want to do as well as we possibly can here in new hampshire,” rubio told reporters. after emerging as the leading “establishment” candidate competing with trump and cruz, rubio faces high stakes in new hampshire. his elevated stature in the race has given his rivals added incentive to attack him. some voters in the state seemed to be warming to him. grace freije, 63, of bow, new hampshire, said she had decided to support rubio after gravitating earlier toward christie. steve mcmahon, 65, said the same.  “he’s not a divisive person,” mcmahon said. “this guy’s got the best shot at winning.”   (reporting by emily flitter; editing by caren bohan and jonathan oatis) sap is the sponsor of this content. it was independently created by reuters’ editorial staff and funded in part by sap, which otherwise has no role in this coverage.",0
" russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday that any decision by the united states to supply defensive weapons to ukraine would fuel the conflict in eastern ukraine and possibly prompt pro russian separatists to expand their campaign there. on a visit to kiev last month, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said he was actively reviewing sending lethal weapons to ukraine to help it defend itself, an option that previous u.s. president barack obama vetoed. ukraine and russia are at loggerheads over a war in eastern ukraine between pro russian separatists and ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which russia denies.  putin, answering a question after a brics summit in china about the possibility of the united states supplying ukraine with heavy weapons, said it was for washington to decide whom it sold or gave weapons to, but he warned against the move, something kiev wants.   the delivery of weapons to a conflict zone doesn t help peacekeeping efforts, but only worsens the situation,  putin told a news briefing.  such a decision would not change the situation but the number of casualties could increase.  in comments likely to be interpreted as a veiled threat, putin suggested that pro russian separatists were likely to respond by expanding their own campaign.  the self declared (pro russian) republics (in eastern ukraine) have enough weapons, including ones captured from the other side  said putin.  it s hard to imagine how the self declared republics would respond. perhaps they would deploy weapons to other conflict zones.  putin also said russia intended to draft a resolution for consideration in the united nations security council, suggesting armed u.n. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) there.  it would help resolve the problem in eastern ukraine,  said putin, saying that a slew of preconditions would need to be met before any such deployment happened.

" britain will submit proposals on how to settle its divorce bill with the european union before an eu summit next month and is expected to negotiate hard, finance minister philip hammond said on sunday. the eu told prime minister theresa may on friday that there was more work to be done to unlock the brexit talks, repeating its early december deadline for her to flesh out britain s opening offer on the financial settlement.  we will make our proposals to the european union in time for the council,  hammond told the bbc, referring to the dec. 14 15 meeting of eu heads of government. he was speaking three days before he sets out britain s budget plan, where he will have to find room within tight fiscal constraints to help may convince voters that the conservative government is tackling britain s domestic problems at the same time as negotiating its exit from the eu.    last week, may met fellow eu leaders to try to break a deadlock over how much britain will pay on leaving the bloc, an issue threatening to derail british hopes for a negotiated exit and an agreement on a new trading relationship by march 2019.  may has signalled she would increase an initial offer that is estimated at some 20 billion euros ($24 billion)   about a third of what brussels wants. but hammond, who has been criticised by supporters of brexit for being too conciliatory towards brussels and lobbying for a  softer  exit, said britain would take a tough stance about how much it owes.  there are some things that we re very clear we do owe under the treaties, other things where we dispute the amounts or even whether something should be included,  hammond said in a separate interview with itv television.  of course we ll negotiate hard to get the very best deal for the british taxpayer.  asked about the prospect of brexit without a trade deal, hammond said he was  increasingly confident  that an agreement could be reached because it was in the interests of both parties. despite scepticism in brussels over the tight timetable, may and her chief negotiator david davis have been clear they want to have a full post brexit free trade deal sealed by the time britain leaves.  however, hammond set out a softer stance on the timing of the trade deal.  we hope that it will be agreed, certainly in principle, that the big elements of it will be agreed before march 2019 so that everybody knows where we are going,  he told itv.

" the eu s top diplomat pledged on thursday to reinvigorate diplomacy with russia, the united states, jordan and others to ensure palestinians have a capital in jerusalem after u.s. president donald trump recognized the city as israel s capital. the european union, a member of the middle east quartet along with the united states, the united nations and russia, believes it has a duty to make its voice heard as the palestinians  biggest aid donor and israel s top trade partner.  the european union has a clear and united position. we believe the only realistic solution to the conflict between israel and palestine is based on two states and with jerusalem as the capital of both,  eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini told a news conference. she said she would meet jordan s foreign minister on friday, while she and eu foreign ministers would discuss jerusalem with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in brussels on monday.  the european union will engage even more with the parties and with our regional and international partners. we will keep working with the middle east quartet, possibly in an enlarged format,  said mogherini, citing jordan, egypt and saudi arabia, as well as norway.  we remain convinced that the role of the united states ... is crucial,  she said. mogherini, who also spoke to palestinian president mahmoud abbas, threw her weight behind jordan s king abdullah, saying he was  a very wise man  that everyone should listen to as the custodian of the muslim holy sites in jerusalem.  trump s decision stirred outrage across the arab and muslim world and alarm among u.s. allies and russia because of jerusalem s internationally disputed status, and the palestinian islamist group hamas urged palestinians to abandon peace efforts and launch a new uprising against israel. mogherini stressed all 28 eu governments were united on the issue of jerusalem and seeking a solution envisaging a palestinian state on land israel took in a 1967 war, but policy divisions within the bloc have weakened its influence.  this is the consolidated european union position,  she said, saying eu foreign ministers made that clear to u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on tuesday in brussels. hurdles for the eu include its range of positions, ranging from germany s strong support for israel to sweden s 2014 decision to officially recognize the state of palestine. the eu is also perceived by some in israel as being too pro palestinian, partly because of the eu s long held opposition to israeli settlements in the occupied west bank, diplomats say.

" democrats in the u.s. house of representatives introduced a new version of a russia and iran sanctions bill on wednesday, hoping to send a message to president donald trump to maintain a strong line against moscow. seeking to force republican house leaders to allow a vote, democrats on the house foreign affairs committee introduced legislation unchanged from what passed the senate by 98 2 on june 15 but has been stalled ever since. while the new bill is identical to what the senate passed, it will be labeled as house legislation to avoid a procedural issue that prompted house republican leaders to send the measure back to the senate. however, there was no sign of support from trump’s fellow republicans, who control majorities in both the house and the senate and control what legislation comes up for a vote. ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for republican house speaker paul ryan, dismissed the democrats’ action as “grandstanding.” the measure was introduced by house democratic leader nancy pelosi and representatives steny hoyer, the no. 2 house democrat, and eliot engel, the ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee. democrats have accused house republicans of stalling the sanctions package because of trump administration concern about provisions setting up a process for congress to approve any  effort by the president to ease sanctions on russia. trump’s attempts to mend relations with russia have been hindered by allegations that moscow interfered in the 2016 u.s. election and colluded with trump’s campaign. russia denies meddling and trump says there was no collusion.     the issue has become even more heated since emails released tuesday showed that donald trump jr, the president’s eldest son, eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about hillary clinton, the democratic rival in the 2016 presidential election. lawmakers and aides said news of that meeting, and the failure to disclose it, added new urgency to the push to pass the russia package. “dilly dallying” house republican leaders said they had not taken up the original senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that all legislation affecting government revenues originate in the house, known as a “blue slip” issue. democrats and some republicans who backed the bill scoffed, saying the problem could have been quickly remedied. “dilly dallying around about the blue slip issue was just a ridiculous waste of time. we could have fixed it in five minutes,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, told reporters. the senate changed the bill to address that issue, but also tweaked it in a way that democrats said weakened a provision requiring congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on russia. the new bill introduced on wednesday would eliminate that change to allow house democrats, as well as republicans, to force a vote on a resolution of disapproval of any effort to ease russia sanctions. “i don’t believe that having the president’s party in a position to protect him from any oversight is good policy for our country,” hoyer told reporters. ryan told a news conference he wants to move a strong bill regarding sanctions on russia as quickly as possible but that the legislation still faced procedural and policy hurdles. the u.s. energy industry has been lobbying against the bill and some republican house members, particularly from oil producing states, have said they might want changes. the russia sanctions legislation was written as an amendment to a bill imposing new sanctions on iran over issues including its ballistic missile program. besides establishing the review process, it puts into law sanctions previously imposed on moscow via presidential executive order and introduces new sanctions.

" arizona voters have narrowly approved a plan to pump $3.5 billion into education coffers over the next decade and put an end to a long running legal battle, republican governor doug ducey said late on thursday. the measure, approved by state lawmakers and ducey last year, provides for arizona to tap its land trust fund and provide an additional $300 for each student, from kindergarten through 12th grade, in public and charter schools. arizona has historically ranked near the bottom of states in funding education. the latest unofficial results from tuesday’s special election showed the measure garnering 50.82 percent of votes cast throughout the southwestern u.s. state, and while some 30,000 votes remained to be counted, ducey declared victory. “this is a huge victory for public education in arizona,” ducey said in a statement. “after years of lawsuits and fighting, we are moving forward and funding our teachers, students and schools – instead of lawyers.” voter approval was required because the measure involved a change to the state’s constitution. the narrow margin of the result proved that a sizeable number of voters disliked the plan, said morgan abraham, chairman of the “no” campaign. “this tells me that voters want to fund education the right way, not through the trust fund, but with general funds,” abraham said, adding that he was disappointed by the outcome of the vote. much of the controversy during the campaign centered on the funding, with critics saying arizona was jeopardizing its future by taking too much money from its land trust fund. about 60 percent of the new money will come from the trust fund, and the rest from the state’s general fund. the governor’s office brokered the deal in a bid to end a 2010 lawsuit by a group of school districts and organizations that charged arizona with failing to fund mandated inflation adjustments to schools during a recent recession.      the state’s highest court already had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and the court case was being appealed by the state at the time of the deal.

" saudi king salman has ordered that women be allowed to drive, ending a restriction seen by rights activists as an emblem of the islamic kingdom s repression of women. here is a look at some of the biggest outstanding women s rights issues in saudi arabia: women must have a male guardian s approval for decisions in fields including marriage, travel, applying for a passport and even medical treatment and employment in some cases. many aspects of the guardianship system are not codified in law but stem from informal practice. the saudi ambassador to the united states has said women will not need permission from a guardian to get a driving license nor to have a guardian in the car. earlier this year king salman issued an order allowing women to benefit from services such as education and healthcare without the consent of a male guardian. rights groups say this is being implemented only on an ad hoc basis. women may testify in court, but in some cases their testimony is considered worth only half that of a man. the kingdom has removed requirements that a woman bring a male relative to identify them in court. saudi arabia licensed the first female attorneys to practice law in 2013, with the right to represent clients and to own and run their own law firms. it has improved women s access to government services in recent years, enabling women to secure their own identity cards and issuing divorced and widowed women family cards, which identify familial relationships and are needed for bureaucratic processes, according to human rights watch. women are required to dress modestly, but there is no specific written dress code and compliance varies in different regions and different situations. in practice, most saudi women are expected to wear the long, dark abaya robe and a headscarf. dress is monitored by religious police and women have been detained and released for immodest clothing. the requirements do not tend to apply to foreign women. unrelated saudi men and women are not supposed to mix, meaning that they are separated into male and family sections in restaurants or entertainment venues or in sex segregated areas at conferences.     in a business environment women can find themselves in areas where they have little or no access to senior officials and policymakers, who are mainly male. the strict segregation policies act as a disincentive to employers wanting to hire women. businesses and government agencies in saudi arabia are segregated, with the exception of oil giant saudi aramco and some foreign companies. saudi arabia allowed women into the national stadium for the first time this week as it launched celebrations to mark the 87th anniversary of its founding. there is no formal bar on women buying or renting property but it can be difficult for women to do so without a male relative, according to rights groups. the saudi government wants to encourage female participation in the workforce. authorities have removed restrictions on women s work in the labor code and ended formal requirements for women to obtain a guardian s permission to work, but some employers still demand this and are not penalized for doing so. saudi women have been moving into roles previously reserved for men such as retail, air traffic control and emergency call centers. but the vast majority of chief executives and senior government officials are male and all male workplaces can lack basic facilities like ladies  restrooms. conservative clerics have repeatedly said women who do physical exercise are immodest, even when they are not in public or seen by men. but saudi public schools will begin offering physical education for girls in this academic year, the education ministry announced in july, and the advisory shura council has opened the door to licensing women s gyms. the kingdom sent two female athletes to the olympics for the first time in 2012, and four to the 2016 games.

" malaysian prime minister najib razak vowed on friday to use every means to protest against u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital, a tough stand likely to win him support among muslim voters. najib has been embroiled in a graft scandal over a state run fund, and has faced unprecedented criticism from former ruling party stalwarts, making the support of members of the muslim, ethnic malay majority vital in a general election next year.  we will continue to fight on this issue, using every available means, through political and diplomatic channels, through discussion and prayer, until one day, god willing, jerusalem belongs to the palestinian people,  najib told a rally of about 1,500 in the administrative capital of putrajaya. he said he would not  sacrifice the sanctity of islam  despite his friendship with trump. najib visited the white house in september.  it is our first duty as muslims to uphold the religion. if jerusalem is a sacred land for muslims, then it is upon us to free it from the grasps of zionists,  najib said. najib and his ruling party have been burnishing their islamic credentials with the aim of boosting their chances in the general election, which must be held by mid 2018.  about 60 percent of malaysia s population is ethnic malay muslim, with most of the rest ethnic chinese and ethnic indian. najib, who did not mention the election in his speech at the rally, is hoping to win a third term despite the multi billion dollar corruption scandal at 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb) that has dogged his premiership for two years. u.s. attorney general jeff sessions this month described the scandal at the sovereign fund set up by najib as the worst form of kleptocracy. the u.s. department of justice has filed several lawsuits to seize more than $1.7 billion in assets believed to have been stolen from 1mdb. sessions did not identify any officials he thought were corrupt. najib, who served as chairman of 1mdb s advisory board, has consistently denied any wrongdoing at the fund, and malaysia s attorney general has cleared him of any wrongdoing. the ruling party united behind najib at a conference this month, letting him stand unopposed in a party leadership contest due next year. a rebounding economy and currency have also helped him improve his image. four years ago, the ruling party crept back into power despite losing the popular vote and registering its worst ever election performance. this time, the challenge is coming from the veteran former prime minister mahathir mohamad, who gave up the premiership in 2003 after 22 years in power and had been najib s mentor. mahathir, the chairman of the opposition coalition, last week called trump an  international bully  and a  villain  for his recognition of jerusalem. mahathir said on twitter the friday rally could  only be meaningful if it results in the bn government acting against donald trump and the united states , referring to the ruling barisan nasional coalition. malaysia was one of the 128 countries that defied trump on thursday and voted in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital.

" the heavily hispanic texas border county of el paso filed suit in federal court on monday to halt a new law backed by the state’s republican leaders to punish “sanctuary cities,” saying the measure was vague, cruel and unconstitutional. the law in texas, which has the longest border with mexico of any u.s. state, takes effect on sept. 1 and calls for jail time for police chiefs and sheriffs who fail to cooperate in u.s. immigration enforcement. the suit filed in a u.s. district court in san antonio on behalf of the county and its sheriff names republican governor greg abbott and others as defendants. it said the law would invite unlawful racial profiling in the county of about 800,000 people where more than 80 percent of the population is of hispanic heritage. “history and logic supports that all texans will not be equally subject to this harassment,” the lawsuit said. abbott has said the law known as senate bill 4 will keep criminals off of the streets. republican backers said there were no major sanctuary cities in texas and the law would prevent any from adopting such practices. it was the first such legislation approved by a state since republican donald trump, who has called for a crackdown on illegal immigration, became president in january.  the texas law allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention. supporters have said immigrants who do not break the law have nothing to fear, while critics contend it allows police to detain people for up to 48 hours for immigration checks, even for minor infractions such as jaywalking. earlier in may, the small texas border town of el cenizo, filed suit against the texas law in federal court, and many major texas cities and counties have said they also intend to sue to halt its implementation. the texas law has also faced criticism from the police chiefs of the state’s largest cities, who said it would divert resources from fighting crime to immigration law enforcement. they added it would widen a gap between police and immigrant communities and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving or preventing crimes. in a newspaper editorial last week, abbott along with the sheriff of hidalgo county, a border county with about the same population as el paso, said sb 4 specifically prohibited racial profiling and discrimination.

" the head of an iran backed iraqi shi ite militia has visited lebanon s border with israel accompanied by hezbollah fighters, a video released on saturday showed, in a show of iranian influence that lebanon s prime minister called illegal. qais al khazali, leader of the iraqi paramilitary group asaib ahl al haq, declared his readiness  to stand together with the lebanese people and the palestinian cause , in the video footage widely circulating on social media. his appearance at the frontier is likely to be seen in the middle east as an example of tehran demonstrating its reach, and could add to tension in lebanon, caught in a regional tussle between iran and saudi arabia. lebanese prime minister saad al hariri issued a statement saying the border visit by a paramilitary in uniform violated lebanese law. he had instructed security chiefs to  prevent any person from carrying out activities of a military nature on the country s territory and to prevent any illegal actions , and barred khazali from entering the country, it said.     lebanon is still recovering from a crisis triggered a month ago, when hariri announced his resignation while visiting saudi arabia, accusing iran and hezbollah of meddling in regional conflicts in violation of lebanon s policy of non intervention. hariri returned to lebanon two weeks later and withdrew his resignation last week, while his government restated its non intervention policy. hezbollah, a heavily armed shi ite group that fights openly in syria as an ally of iran, serves in the power sharing government with hariri, a sunni muslim politician with deep business and political ties to saudi arabia. a commander in an alliance between hezbollah, iran and russia, who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity, said al khazali was accompanied by officers from asaib ahl al haq and visited the entire border with  occupied palestine . the commander did not say when the visit took place. in the video, an unidentified commander, presumably from hezbollah, gestures toward military outposts in northern israel and explains to khazali that they were hit by hezbollah missiles in previous confrontations between the group and israel.  we are now on the border separating southern lebanon with occupied palestine with our brothers in hezbollah, and announce our full preparedness to stand united...against the israeli occupier,  khazali says in the video.  hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said in june that any future war waged by israel against syria or lebanon could draw in fighters from countries including iran and iraq. iran s revolutionary guards, who established hezbollah in lebanon in 1982, have mobilized shi ite militias from around the region in recent years. they have fought islamic state in iraq and helped president bashar al assad in the war in syria.

" a solution in yemen s two and a half year old civil war will likely come through military rather than political means, the country s saudi backed president said, blaming the iran aligned houthis of obstructing chances of peace. speaking in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly, president abd rabbu mansour hadi also told the saudi owned al arabiya channel that a plan to hand over control of the country s main port to a neutral party remained blocked by the houthis and their ally, former president ali abdullah saleh.  the military solution is the more likely one for the yemen crisis in light of the intransigence of the houthi and saleh coup militias which continue to take orders from iran,  hadi said in the interview, according to a text provided by the yemeni state run saba news agency.  despite that, the legitimate government continues to extend its hand for peace because it is responsible for the yemeni people and for lifting the suffering from it,  he added. more than 10,000 people have been killed in the war, which began in march 2015 when the houthis advanced on hadi s interim headquarters in the southern port city of aden, forcing him to flee the country and seek saudi military help. a saudi led coalition has since joined the fighting in a war that has also caused one of the world s worst humanitarian crises and shows no signs of ending soon. the houthis deny having significant ties to iran, and say the saudi backed coalition seeks to foment  destruction  inside and outside the region. hadi accused former u.s. president barack obama of turning a blind eye to what he described as iranian expansion that allowed the houthis to seize the yemeni capital sanaa as he was only preoccupied with the success of nuclear talks with tehran.  but the position under the current administration is better because it stands on the basis that there should be pressure on the houthis and iran so their expansion in the region would stop.  hadi said the houthis still had a chance to join the political process if they agreed to hand over weapons and formed a party to help pursue national reconciliation. the houthis say they are willing to hand over their weapons to a national unity government formed to represent the whole country.

" a prominent illinois republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake facebook and twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks.  “after some cyber security issues arose, i began to re evaluate my continued public service,” representative ron sandack, house republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated sunday and provided on monday by the republican caucus. sandack, known as an adamant defender of republican governor bruce rauner’s initiatives on the floor of the democratic dominated house, was up for re election in november against democrat greg hose. his resignation comes as both major u.s. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including friday’s leak of emails that have embarrassed democrats as they gather for the party’s convention in philadelphia this week. sandack had been battling since july 4 to remove multiple fake facebook and twitter accounts in his name, he told capitol fax, a respected political blog based in springfield, the state capital. it is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name. sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his facebook and twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, capitol fax reported. a spokeswoman for jim durkin, leader of the house republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace sandack as republican candidate for his seat. rauner did not respond to reporters’ questions about sandack following an event on monday morning.  sandack is a chicago lawyer and former mayor of downers grove, illinois. he was appointed in 2010 to the illinois senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban chicago district. in his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events.

" a group of 19 retired u.s. generals and admirals on thursday backed democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s position on the u.s. military prison in guantanamo and torture and called for an end to the “dangerous rhetoric” from her republican opponents. “the republican candidates have turned this into a game to see who can seem toughest. yet, how we combat our enemies and defeat isis is not a game, and these proposals would only make us weaker,” the retired officers said in a statement, using an acronym for islamic state, the militant group active in syria, iraq and elsewhere. republican candidates have opposed an obama administration plan to close the guantanamo bay prison in cuba. republican front runner and real estate mogul donald trump said this month he would bring back waterboarding, widely condemned as a form of torture, and would be open to even tougher measures in the fight against islamic state. clinton was secretary of state during president barack obama’s first term, when he banned the use of torture. she has supported the closing of the guantanamo prison for terrorism suspects, which obama says has become a recruiting tool for militant groups fighting the united states and its allies around the globe. the retired officers said expanding the use of guantanamo “is dangerous and has real negative consequences for our national security.” expanding the use of torture, they said, would compromise global u.s. leadership and put american troops and civilians at risk. “we applaud hillary clinton’s leadership on these issues and call on the immediate end to the dangerous rhetoric coming from the right,” the retired officers said.

" the white house on friday said it had asked congress for $44 billion in supplemental disaster assistance to help those hurt by recent hurricanes that hit puerto rico, texas, florida and the u.s. virgin islands, far short of the aid some officials have called for. the white house said it expected to seek additional funds after a fuller analysis. u.s. representative frank pallone and senator ron wyden, both democrats, called the request “a dereliction of duty by the trump administration to american citizens in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands that need our help. “this woefully inadequate funding request does not provide the necessary resources required to properly respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,” they added. puerto rico governor ricardo rossello asked for $94.4 billion to rebuild the u.s. territory’s infrastructure. texas was seeking $61 billion and florida had asked for $27 billion. the $44 billion would be in addition to about $50 billion congress previously approved for hurricane and disaster relief. white house budget director mick mulvaney said in a letter to house speaker paul ryan that the $44 billion “does not represent the final request” for assistance for the victims, especially in puerto rico and the virgin islands, where needs were still being assessed. “at this time, the administration is requesting an additional fiscal year 2018 funding in the amount of $44 billion and the necessary authorities to address ongoing recovery efforts,” mulvaney said in the letter. the administration also wants congress to approve new tax relief for victims of recent california wildfires, which mirror what congress awarded recently to hurricane victims. the white house also wants to make houses of worship eligible for disaster relief funding. senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 republican in the chamber, on thursday dismissed the latest request as “wholly inadequate” for his state. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders defended the request. “up until this point texas has not put any state dollars into this process. we feel strongly that they should step up and play a role and work with the federal government in this process. we did a thorough assessment and that was completed and this was the number that we put forward to congress today,” she said. she said the new request “primarily addresses texas and florida those storms took place ahead of puerto rico. the assessment for puerto rico hasn’t been completed yet. once that’s done, we fully anticipate that there will be additional requests at that time.” ",0

" brazil s army commander dismissed a general s suggestion that members of the army s high command endorse some sort of  military intervention  if high courts fail to stem political corruption, the online services of brazil s two biggest newspapers said. at a gathering of freemasons in bras lia last friday, general antonio hamilton mour o had suggested his fellows at the high command think the current timing is not favorable for military intervention but that it could eventually take place through  successive steps,  folha de s. paulo said.  either institutions sort out the political problem, through the judiciary branch of power and withdrawing from public life all those elements involved in illicit acts, or then we will have to impose that,  mour o was quoted as saying by o estado de s. paulo newspaper on sunday. army commander eduardo villas b as dismissed mour o s comments by saying there is  no possibility  of a military intervention in brazil. b as told estado that since 1985, when a 21 year military dictatorship came to an end, the military was  not responsible for any source of turmoil in the nation s life, and it will continue to be like that.  while mour o, currently the army s head of finance, hinted that there could come a time when the army would have to impose military action, he said it would not be to take power from civilians, folha said. an action would aim at  telling people,  beware, let s fix this now so the country can move forward and not continue the way it is,  the newspaper quoted him as saying. the army command did not immediately respond to request for comment. mour o could not be found by reuters to comment on his remarks. mour o, in the army since 1972, was discharged from brazil s south military command and transferred to the federal capital of bras lia in 2015 for administrative work after publicly criticizing former brazilian president dilma rousseff. rousseff was impeached last year after she was found guilty of doctoring budget accounts. her fall was accelerated by a three year corruption scandal known as operation car wash, which has ensnared top members of her workers party and her ruling coalition in bribery and graft acts.

" president donald trump said on thursday he will work with the u.s. congress to approve grants and loans to help rebuild puerto rico after it was devastated by hurricane maria a month ago. already mired in debt after years of recession, the u.s. territory faces storm related damages that some estimates have pegged as high as $95 billion, and has asked the federal government to make exceptions to rules that typically require states and local governments to shoulder part of the cost of recovery. trump did not give any specifics about how much money the government may give or loan to the cash strapped territory, home to 3.4 million u.s. citizens. “i have given my blessing to congress, and congress is working with you and your representatives on coming up with a plan and a payment plan and how it’s all going to be funded. because you are talking about some substantial numbers,” trump said to puerto rico governor ricardo rossello at the beginning of an oval office meeting. trump and some of his top aides suggested last week that there would be limits to how much help puerto rico could expect from washington. but on thursday, the president’s remarks were broadly supportive. the hurricane laid waste to the island’s power grid, destroying homes, roads and other vital infrastructure. the bankrupt territory is still struggling to provide basic services like running water. an oversight board charged with resolving puerto rico’s debt crisis has said the island’s government would run out of money by the end of the month without help. trump emphasized that repayment of federal loans and other storm related debt owed by puerto rico would come before repayment of the island’s existing $72 billion in debt. “any money that’s put in by people   whether it’s public or private   they’re going to want to come in first position,” trump said. “we’re going to coming before   far before   any existing debt that’s on the island,” he said. trump declined to opine on whether the process would be easier if puerto rico were a state rather than a territory   a hot button political issue on the island. “you’ll get me into trouble with that question,” he told a reporter. while in washington, rossello also met with senate leaders. the senate is expected to vote in coming days on an aid package that includes $18.7 billion for the federal emergency management agency, which has been helping texas, florida, puerto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands recover from three massive hurricanes. some senators would like to see more funds added to that package, senator john thune, a member of the republican leadership, told reporters.  senator marco rubio, a republican from florida who has been deeply involved in discussions over the aid, said earlier on thursday that he wants to tweak the bill so the island could more quickly access funds. congress is expected to consider another aid package by the end of december, but that could be too late for the island, which currently has no tax revenue, rubio said. “i know from experience the further away we get from these hurricanes, the less of a sense of urgency there is,” rubio said. rossello has asked the federal government for approval to use disaster aid to cover a broad range of costs. he has also asked the white house and congress for at least $4.6 billion in block grants and other types of funding. “the reality is that we still need to do a lot more for the people of puerto rico and that’s why we’re meeting,” rossello said. “this is not over, not over by a long shot.” ",0
" jason chaffetz, chairman of the house of representatives oversight and government reform committee, said on thursday that u.s. attorney general jeff sessions should “clarify his testimony” about his contacts with russian officials during the trump presidential campaign. chaffetz, a utah republican, said in a twitter post, “ag sessions should clarify his testimony and recuse himself.” democrats have called for an independent investigation into possible ties between russia and the trump campaign.  u.s. house democratic leader nancy pelosi called on sessions to resign on wednesday after the washington post reported he failed to disclose two meetings he had with russia’s ambassador before donald trump was inaugurated as president.

" nearly all of new york city’s millionaires would receive big tax cuts under president donald trump’s proposed tax overhaul, while  more than one third of moderate  and middle income families would face increases, according to a government report issued on thursday. city comptroller scott stringer said trump’s overall plan, as proposed during the republican president’s campaign, would give more than $5 billion of tax cuts to city dwellers. but almost two thirds of that would go to those earning more than $500,000, even though they bear just over one half of the total tax burden.  “we already have astounding wealth gaps across the city and across the country,” stringer told a news conference. “the trump tax code, if implemented, would only exacerbate it.” the lower taxes for wealthier residents would be achieved through lower marginal tax rates on ordinary and capital gains income and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (amt). last week, u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said trump’s objective is a tax cut for the middle class, not the top 1 percent. he said he is aiming for passage of a comprehensive tax overhaul by the time congress takes its august recess.  stringer’s office analyzed tax returns of 365,000 new york city households. it found that 92 percent of the city’s millionaires would receive, on average, a tax cut of at least $113,000. nearly half of single parents who make $25,000 to $50,000 would experience a tax increase, it said. the tax cuts, which would reduce federal revenue by more than $2 trillion over 10 years, are driving proposed budget cuts that would leave the city, home to 60,000 homeless people, with a weakened social safety net, stringer said. “i find it incredible that this guy, who comes from new york city, who has major investments here, can’t see what his proposal will do to his hometown,” he said. “and then when you scratch the surface, you realize that part of his agenda and who benefits from it is donald trump himself.” based on the limited information available from trump’s now public 2005 federal tax return, his proposal to eliminate the amt would have benefited him by $31 million that year. in contrast, under his tax plan, a single mother raising two children on less than $50,000 a year would face a tax increase of $464.

" pope francis called on thursday for decisive measures to resolve the political reasons that caused mostly muslim refugees in myanmar to flee to bangladesh and urged countries to help the dhaka government deal with the crisis. however, just as on the first leg of his trip, in myanmar, he did not use the word rohingya to describe the refugees, which is contested by the yangon government and military. in a speech before bangladeshi president abdul hamid and diplomats hours after arriving under heavy security in dhaka, the chaotic and dusty capital of 14 million people, francis instead spoke of  refugees from rakhine state . in his speech, francis, who used the term rohingya twice this year in appeals from the vatican, praised impoverished bangladesh s  spirit of generosity and solidarity  in helping  a massive influx of refugees from rakhine state . the exodus of some 625,000 muslim rohingya people from rakhine state to the southern tip of bangladesh was sparked by a military crackdown in response to rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on aug. 25.  scores of rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, and refugees arriving in bangladesh told of killings and rapes. the united states has said the campaign by mainly buddhist myanmar s military included  horrendous atrocities  aimed at  ethnic cleansing . the military denies the accusations.  none of us can fail to be aware of the gravity of the situation, the immense toll of human suffering involved, and the precarious living conditions of so many of our brothers and sisters, a majority of whom are women and children, crowded in the refugee camps,  francis said at the presidential palace.  it is imperative that the international community take decisive measures to address this grave crisis, not only by working to resolve the political issues that have led to the mass displacement of people, but also by offering immediate material assistance to bangladesh in its effort to respond effectively to urgent human needs.  even though his calls for justice, human rights and respect in myanmar were widely seen as applicable to the rohingya, who are not recognized as myanmar citizens or as members of a distinct ethnicity, rights groups such as amnesty international said they were disappointed he did not defend them by name. in studiously avoiding the highly charged term, the pope has so far followed the advice of church officials in myanmar, who feared it could set off a diplomatic incident and turn myanmar s military and government against minority christians. francis is due to meet a group of rohingya refugees in dhaka on friday. in his address to the pope, the president of bangladesh, which is predominantly muslim, used the term rohingya several  times and accused the myanmar army of committing  ruthless atrocities . he called for a  safe, sustainable and dignified return  of the refugees to their homes. myanmar and bangladesh signed an accord last week on terms for the return of rohingya, though rights groups are skeptical myanmar will follow through on the deal and have called for independent observers for any repatriation. there are concerns about protection for rohingya from further violence if and when they go home, and about a path to resolving their legal status   most are stateless   and whether they would be allowed to return to their old homes. the pope s visit to the south asian country unfolded under heavy security. while francis stuck to his custom of using a simple car, he was escorted by many armored military and police vehicles. the country was shocked on july 1, 2016, when gunmen stormed a caf  in dhaka s upscale gulshan neighborhood, killing 22 people, most of them foreigners, in an overnight siege. islamic state militants claimed responsibility.

" myanmar s government will manage the redevelopment of villages torched during violence in rakhine state that has sent nearly half a million rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh, a minister was reported on wednesday as saying. the plan for the redevelopment of areas destroyed by fires, which the government has blamed on rohingya insurgents, is likely to raise concern about prospects for the return of the 480,000 refugees, and compound fears of ethnic cleansing.  according to the law, burnt land becomes government managed land,  minister for social development, relief and resettlement win myat aye told a meeting in the rakhine state capital of sittwe, the global new light of myanmar newspaper said. win myat aye also heads a committee tasked with implementing recommendations on solving rakhine s long simmering tensions. citing a disaster management law, he said in a meeting with authorities on tuesday that redevelopment would  be very effective . the law says the government oversees reconstruction in areas damaged in disasters, including conflict. there was no elaboration on any plan or what access to their old villages any returning rohingya could expect. the minister was not immediately available for comment. human rights groups using satellite images have said about half of more than 400 rohingya villages in the north of rankine state have been burned in the violence. refugees arriving in bangladesh have accused the army and buddhist vigilantes of mounting a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving rohingya out of myanmar. in washington, lawmakers in the u.s. congress condemned the treatment of the rohingya and some questioned the former obama administration s decision to lift sanctions on myanmar after a civilian led government came to power. ed royce, republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, told a hearing the myanmar government s response to the crisis had been  appalling.  he said national leader aung san suu kyi had a duty to speak out and that her statements on the crisis had been  widely off the mark.   perpetrators of this ethnic cleansing must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,  he said. ted yoho, republican chair of the subcommittee, said the military crackdown had been characterized by  sickening crimes against humanity  and said washington should look at what policy options were available to stop the military violence and encourage the government to take a firmer stand against it. the trump administration has stepped up its criticism of the myanmar military s behavior, but has refrained from using the terms  ethnic cleansing  or  crimes against humanity  and given no indication of plans to re impose sanctions on the country where it competes for influence with strategic rival china. buddhist majority myanmar has rejected u.n. accusations of ethnic cleansing of rohingya muslims in response to coordinated attacks by rohingya insurgents on the security forces on aug. 25. it has also rejected accusations of crimes against humanity leveled this week by human rights watch. the government has said about half of rohingya villages have been abandoned, but blames insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army for attacking civilians. it says nearly 500 people have been killed since aug. 25, nearly 400 of them insurgents. the violence and the refugee exodus is the biggest crisis that the government of nobel peace laureate suu kyi has faced since it came to power last year in a transition from nearly 50 years of military rule. myanmar considers the rohingya illegal immigrants from bangladesh and bouts of suppression and strife have flared for decades. most rohingya are stateless. suu kyi has faced scathing criticism and calls for her nobel prize to be withdrawn. she denounced rights violations in an address last week and vowed that abusers would be prosecuted. she also said any refugees verified as coming from myanmar under a 1992 process agreed with bangladesh would be allowed back. suu kyi has little, if any, control over the security forces under a military drafted constitution that also bars her from the presidency and gives the military veto power over political reform. many refugees are gloomy about their chances of going home, saying they fear they lack the paperwork they expect would be demanded to prove they came from myanmar. myanmar is due to take a party of diplomats to the conflict zone on thursday to let them see the situation. a group of aid organizations said on tuesday the total number of refugees who had fled to bangladesh since aug. 25 had been revised up to 480,000, after 35,000 people were found to have been missed out of the previous tally. aid agencies say refugees are still arriving, though at a slower pace. they have an overall plan to help 1.2 million people, including 200,000 rohingya who were already in camps in bangladesh and 300,000 people in  host communities .  they have absolutely nothing,  u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi said in geneva after returning from a visit to the camps in bangladesh.  it is very clear the cause of this crisis is in myanmar but that the solution is also in myanmar,  he said.   the risk of spread of terrorist violence in this particular region is very, very high  unless the issue was resolved, he warned. grandi said he had not been informed about government plans for redevelopment but it had to include all communities.  if development is not inclusive, it will not be addressing the root causes and solve the problem,  he said.

" most republicans believe russia is attempting to influence the u.s. presidential election, according to a reuters/ipsos poll, despite comments by the party’s nominee, donald trump, downplaying the possibility. some 55 percent of u.s. adults, including 51 percent of republicans and 65 percent of democrats, said they thought russia was trying to tip the scales in the nov. 8 presidential election, according to the survey.  most american adults   62 percent of democrats and 48 percent of republicans   think putin is supporting trump for the white house, the poll found. some 71 percent of those who suspect russia of meddling believe moscow is doing so through the recent hacks of democratic emails, according to the oct. 18 24 survey. but 57 percent of those who suspect russian interference also believe trump has “no involvement in russia’s release of unflattering information” on his democratic rival, hillary clinton. the u.s. government has accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks targeting the democratic party that has led to the release of thousands of illegally obtained emails, revealing the sometimes unflattering inner workings of the party, clinton’s campaign, and her family’s charitable foundation.  clinton has said she believes the kremlin is trying to help trump, calling her rival a “puppet” of the russian leader. trump has declined to implicate the country in any wrongdoing. “i don’t think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the (democratic national committee),” trump said during the first presidential debate last month. he suggested the culprit could be anyone from russia, to china or even “a 400 pound person lying in bed.” russia has denied it sponsors or encourages hacking activity. russian president vladimir putin accused u.s. politicians on thursday of whipping up “hysteria” about a nonexistent threat in order to distract voters. putin, who has described trump as “very talented,” said on thursday the new york businessman “behaves extravagantly” to “get through to voters’ hearts.”  trump has said he is not close with putin, but has also said he believes the russian president is a stronger leader than u.s. president barack obama. already chilly relations between the united states and russia have deteriorated over disagreements over the conflicts in ukraine and syria.  u.s. officials say u.s. agencies have concluded that two russian intelligence agencies   the military’s gru and the civilian foreign intelligence agency, the fsb   are behind u.s. political hacking, particularly that directed against democratic party organizations and individuals. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english, and included 2,008 american adults. it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

" crucial details of the republican tax plan, including the proposed corporate rate, were in flux late on tuesday as negotiators from the u.s. congress rushed to finalize the plan ahead of a self imposed wednesday deadline. republican tax writers were tinkering with how to best reconcile differences between bills passed by the house of representatives and the senate, without exacerbating the deficit impact of legislation that could add as much as $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to independent estimates. with a meeting of the official bipartisan negotiating committee scheduled for wednesday, republicans were still weighing how to best scale back popular individual deductions for mortgage interest and local tax payments, and whether the proposed corporate rate of 20 percent in both bills may rise to 21 percent. “we’re still talking,” no. 2 senate republican john cornyn said of a possible 21 percent corporate rate.  both the senate and house bills proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent, eliminating or scaling back some taxes paid only by rich americans and offering a mixed bag of cuts to other individuals and families, some of which would be short term. republican senator orrin hatch, head of the senate tax writing committee and one of the negotiators, told reporters in reference to the corporate tax rate, “i hesitate to give any figure at this point because it’s still being debated.”   analysts have said that a 1 percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenue over a decade. shifting it even slightly could help negotiators who are attempting to keep the bill within preset budget parameters. congressional researchers have estimated the tax plans, as written, would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects. president donald trump wants to sign a tax bill by year’s end, potentially marking the republicans’ first major legislative victory since trump’s victory gave the party control of the white house as well as both chambers of congress. trump is scheduled to host republican tax negotiators at the white house for lunch on wednesday and to deliver a speech laying out his closing argument for the legislation alongside five middle class families who would benefit, senior administration officials told reporters on tuesday. trump is expected to counter claims that the tax plan largely benefits corporations and the wealthy by highlighting how it would also cut rates for lower  and middle income taxpayers, who could see additional benefits such as higher wages following the corporate rate cut, the officials said. independent government analyses by the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, which assists congressional tax writers, and the congressional budget office, which examines the budget impact of legislation, both concluded that wealthier taxpayers would disproportionately benefit from the republican proposals. when asked who stands to benefit most from republican tax legislation, more than half of american adults selected either the wealthy or large u.s. corporations, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on monday. senator susan collins, a key moderate republican whose support was critical to passage of the senate bill but who has said she will need to review the final package before casting another vote, was critical on tuesday about talks to cut the top individual tax rate. “there has been a lot of discussion” about lowering the top individual rate to 37 percent, and “having the corporate rate not be as low,” collins said. the house tax plan would maintain the top individual tax rate paid by the wealthy at 39.6 percent. the senate plan would cut it to 38.5 percent. “i don’t think lowering the top rate is a good idea,” collins told reporters.  ",0
" a u.s. appeals court on wednesday reversed a ruling that prevented arkansas from cutting off medicaid funding to planned parenthood following the release of controversial videos secretly recorded by an anti abortion group. the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals in st. louis reversed a ruling forbidding arkansas from carrying through with republican governor asa hutchinson’s directive to suspend medicaid reimbursements to a planned parenthood affiliate. u.s. district judge kristine baker in little rock had ruled in favor of three women who claimed arkansas violated their rights under the federal medicaid law to choose any qualified provider offering services they were seeking. but by a 2 1 vote, a 8th circuit said the provision of the medicaid law the women relied on does not unambiguously create a federal right for individual patients that they could enforce in court. u.s. circuit judge steven colloton wrote that the lack of such a right does not mean state officials have unlimited authority to terminate medicaid providers. “we conclude only that congress did not unambiguously confer the particular right asserted by the patients in this case,” he wrote. u.s. circuit judge michael melloy dissented, saying four other appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion and found a private right of enforcement existed. raegan mcdonald mosley, chief medical officer of planned parenthood federation of america, in a statement said the fight “is not over.” “we will do everything in our power to protect our patients’ access to birth control cancer screenings, and other lifesaving care,” mcdonald mosley said. arkansas cut off funds for planned parenthood after the anti abortion activist group center for medical progress released videos in 2015 it claimed showed the group’s officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts for profit.  planned parenthood has denied the allegation and says 13 states that investigated those claims have cleared it of wrongdoing. hutchinson, who was among republican governors nationally who targeted the organization following those videos, welcomed wednesday’s ruling. “this is a substantial legal victory for the right of the state to determine whether medicaid providers are acting in accordance with best practices and affirms the prerogative of the state to make reasoned judgments on the medicaid program,” he said in a statement. planned parenthood does not perform surgical abortions in arkansas, which forbids public funding of abortions except in cases of rape or incest. but it provides other gynecological services as well as birth control and breast examinations.

" afghanistan s telecoms regulator wrote to internet service providers this week ordering them to block the messaging services whatsapp and telegram but it was not immediately clear whether they had complied. use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in afghanistan over recent years. social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator atra was widely shared on social media.     some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the national directorate for security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the taliban and other insurgent groups. it was not immediately possible to confirm the reports. the acting minister for telecommunications, shahzad aryobee, posted a message on facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.  the government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,  he wrote. the letter by telecoms regulator atra, dated nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block telegram and facebook inc s (fb.o) whatsapp services  without delay  for a period of 20 days. however, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on saturday on both state owned operator salaam and private service providers. on friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with whatsapp services that were experienced in several countries. mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in afghanistan since the taliban were ousted from power by a u.s. led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage. whatsapp and similar services, including facebook messenger and viber, are widely used by afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own. the movement s main spokesman, zabihullah mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his viber number  in case whatsapp is not working .

" an election could be a year away in army ruled thailand, but anutin charnvirakul is already eyeing a role as a potential kingmaker with ties across the traditional political divide and to the politicized generals. a businessman and amateur pilot whose party came third in the last election, anutin, 51, has seen his political profile rise as parties start to map out a strategy for an election the junta has promised for the end of next year. pundits have tipped anutin as a possible prime minister in a coalition government made more likely by a new voting system expected to weaken the color coded parties behind more than a decade of turmoil leading to a 2014 coup.  i think it is better to be a kingmaker in this situation rather than an opportunistic prime minister,  anutin told reuters in a recent interview. the main support for anutin s bhumjaithai party is among farming communities in the lower northeast and he reckoned it could increase its share of seats to 50 out of 500 at the next election, from 34 in the last vote in 2011.  i have never been closer to the doorstep of government house,  he said, referring to the official prime ministerial offices. anutin said he had a good personal relationship with both major parties   a rarity in polarized thailand, where the army took power in a 2014 coup in the name of ending bloody protests. anutin was once a senior official in the party led by former prime minister thaksin shinawatra, whose  red  populist movement has strong support in the north and among the poor.  it has won every election since 2001 and it was a government led by thaksin s sister, yingluck, that was ousted in the most recent coup. but anutin also has links to thaksin s rivals, led by the  yellow  democrat party which draws support from the south and particularly from bangkok s elite. anutin s father   bhumjaithai s founder   served in the last democrat government.  there are major ideological differences between political groups and i no longer want to take sides,  anutin said.   the bottom line is, the country should not return to turmoil plagued by street demonstrations between different camps.  anutin was identified in 2009 as a close associate of thailand s then crown prince, who is now king maha vajiralongkorn, according to a u.s. embassy cable published by wikileaks.  thailand s king plays a powerful role behind the scenes. anutin did not comment on any relationship. the democrat party s deputy leader, ong art klampaiboon, said it was too early to comment on what might happen at the election. former deputy prime minister phongthep thepkanjana of the shinawatra linked pheu thai party shared a similar view. suspicions are rife that junta leader prayuth chan ocha, or another military backed candidate, will seek to become prime minister after elections. a new constitution guarantees the army a lasting say. anutin is the former chairman of sino thai engineering & construction pcl, thailand s third biggest building firm, which was founded by his father. his fortune has helped finance his political ambitions as well as his hobbies of flying light aircraft and collecting  antique tea sets and buddha statues.

[l5n1m119t] president uhuru kenyatta, who won the august vote only to have his victory annulled, has accused the supreme court of bringing the country close to  judicial chaos . opposition leader raila odinga and his supporters have turned their ire on the election board, accusing it of wrongly handing the august vote to kenyatta.  supporters from both sides have traded insults and accusations, raising fears tensions could boil over into ethnic violence, as in 2007 when 1,200 people were killed after a disputed election. in the capital of the east african economic powerhouse, police fired rounds of teargas at small groups over several hours in at least three locations in the downtown business district, a reuters witness said. after a meeting with the election board, british and u.s. diplomats condemned  inflammatory rhetoric  by politicians and said it undermined the voting authorities  preparations for the new election. in the first signal that western governments might take concrete action against hate speech, a british diplomat told reporters:  anyone who is found to be inciting or engaging in violence must be held accountable ... the uk reserves right to take appropriate action which may include refusing or revoking visas.  kenyatta and odinga have been sparring over proposed changes to the election system to prevent the supreme court from annulling the results again, raising doubts about the date of the re run, currently scheduled for oct. 26. kenyatta said on monday opposition supporters should accept the supreme court s timeline for the new poll.    you can t have your cake and eat it,  he said at an event in nairobi.  if you celebrated the court s decision to repeat the election you must also respect the court s decision to have (the election board) preside over the repeat election within 60 days.

" south korea and japan on tuesday welcomed u.s. president donald trump s move to put north korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, saying it will ramp up pressure on the reclusive regime to get rid of its nuclear weapons. the designation, announced on monday, allows the united states to impose more sanctions on north korea, which is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of u.n. security council sanctions. (graphic: nuclear north korea   tmsnrt.rs/2le5yjf)  i welcome and support (the designation) as it raises the pressure on north korea,  japanese prime minister shinzo abe told reporters. south korea said it expected the listing to contribute to peaceful denuclearisation, the foreign ministry said in a text message. north korea has vowed never to give up its nuclear weapons program, which it defends as a necessary defense against u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea, a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, denies any such plans. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said china had noted the reports on the u.s. decision.  currently, the situation on the korean peninsula is complicated and sensitive,  lu told a daily news briefing.  we still hope all relevant parties can do more to alleviate the situation and do more that is conducive to all relevant parties returning to the correct path of negotiation, dialogue and consultation to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue.  the move will further weigh on the  precarious situation  on the peninsula, china s official xinhua news agency said in an english language editorial.  the prospect of a nuclear free korean peninsula has been pushed farther away by one after another irresponsible action or blaring rhetoric,  it said. this year s rapid escalation of tension was largely down to a  game of chicken  between washington and pyongyang, it added.  trump s re listing of north korea as a sponsor of terrorism comes a week after he returned from a 12 day trip to asia in which containing north korea s nuclear ambitions was a centerpiece of his discussions.  in addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, north korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil,  trump told reporters at the white house.  this designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on north korea and related persons and supports our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime.  australian prime minister malcolm turnbull also backed trump s decision.  kim jong un runs a global criminal operation from north korea peddling arms, peddling drugs, engaged in cyber crime and of course threatening the stability of region with his nuclear weapons,  turnbull told reporters in sydney, referring to the north korean leader. trump, who has often criticized his predecessors  policies toward north korea as being too soft, said the designation should have been made  a long time ago . north korea was put on the u.s. terrorism sponsor list for the 1987 bombing of a korean air flight that killed all 115 people aboard. but the administration of former president george w. bush, a republican, removed it in 2008 in exchange for progress in denuclearisation talks. experts say the designation will be largely symbolic as north korea is already heavily sanctioned by the united states. on monday, south korean president moon jae in s special security adviser, moon chung in, told reporters any such designation would be  more symbolic than substance . the united states has designated only three other countries   iran, sudan and syria   as state sponsors of terrorism. north korea has said it plans to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. it has fired two missiles over japan and on sept. 3 conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test.

" federal election observers can only be sent to five states in this year’s u.s. presidential election, among the smallest deployments since the voting rights act was passed in 1965 to end racial discrimination at the ballot box. the plan, confirmed in a u.s. department of justice fact sheet seen by reuters, reflects changes brought about by the supreme court’s 2013 decision to strike down parts of the act, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. voting rights advocates told reuters they were concerned that the scaling back of observers would make it harder to detect and counter efforts to intimidate or hinder voters, especially in southern states with a history of racial discrimination at the ballot box. the supreme court ruling undercut a key section of the act that requires such states to obtain u.s. approval before changing election laws. the court struck down the formula used to determine which states were affected. by doing so, it ended the justice department’s ability to select voting areas it deemed at risk of racial discrimination and deploy observers there, the fact sheet said. eleven mostly southern states had been certified as needing federal observers by the department. federal observers can still be sent to monitor elections but only when authorized by federal court rulings. currently, courts have done so in five states: alabama, alaska, california, louisiana, and new york, according to the justice department. a justice department spokesman declined to comment on the fact sheet or say how many people will be deployed to monitor voting until closer to the nov. 8 election pitting republican donald trump against democrat hillary clinton. in recent presidential elections, the justice department has sent more than 780 people to watch elections around the country. they were split into three categories. the supreme court ruling reduced that to two, according to the document. one category is justice department staff, who have no statutory authority to access polling sites but still monitor voting nationwide. they must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. a second group are federal observers trained by the office of personnel management with unfettered access to polling sites. they are only deployed by federal court order. a third group — which the document said has been eliminated by the supreme court decision — are federal observers deployed to jurisdictions that the attorney general selected based on evidence of possible racial discrimination. they were also trained by the office of personnel management and had full access to polling sites. attorney general loretta lynch said on friday the justice department’s ability to deploy election observers had been “severely curtailed” by the supreme court’s decision. since congress passed the 1965 act, federal observers have gathered evidence of unlawful activity and prepared reports from polling sites that can be used as evidence in court. in the november 2004 presidential election, the last for which the justice department provided numbers of federal observers, about 840 federal observers and more than 250 department personnel were dispatched to polling sites in 86 jurisdictions in 25 states. “the mix of tools has shifted,” said justin levitt, who oversees the justice department’s voting section. the department still has the ability to send in personnel and take legal action against election officials where necessary, he said in an interview. but justice department staff who monitor elections have significantly less authority than federal observers. at any point on election day, justice department staff can be denied entry to a voting area or asked to leave, unlike a federal observer. that could make it more difficult to gather evidence of voting problems and potentially make it harder to prosecute cases of suppression, say voting rights advocates. suppression can take a number of forms, such as intimidating or misinforming voters, or denying them access to voting materials in their own language. relying on justice department personnel to monitor elections is “a far cry” from federal observers who are statutorily authorized to be inside the polling place, said gerry hebert, executive director of the washington, d.c. based non profit campaign legal center. hebert, a former senior justice department voting rights official, oversaw teams of federal observers in the u.s. south before leaving the department in 1994. federal observer reports have been cited in court cases by groups alleging voter fraud. in sandoval county, new mexico, federal observer reports showed that native american voters had difficulty getting voting information in their native languages during the decade between 1994 and 2004, according to a 2011 court order in a case the united states brought against the county. dale ho, director of the american civil liberties union’s voting rights project, said federal observers are especially needed this year because 17 states have tightened restrictions on voting since the last presidential election. “we’re very disappointed by the decision of the justice department,” said ho. the supreme court ruling did not mention the federal observer program specifically, “so i don’t think this decision was inevitable,” he added. anita earls, the executive director of the southern coalition for social justice and a former senior official in the justice department’s voting section, said the guaranteed ability of federal observers to examine voter registration rolls and remain inside polling stations makes them more effective than justice department staff at catching voter suppression.

" a group that wanted to draft house speaker paul ryan as a republican presidential candidate is shutting down, a day after ryan’s political operation sent the organization a cease and desist letter demanding it halt its campaign. in a statement on friday the committee to draft speaker ryan said it had become “increasingly clear that the committee’s efforts, however well intended, could become an unwanted distraction to the speaker’s current responsibilities.” ryan, a wisconsin congressman who was mitt romney’s vice presidential running mate on the republicans’ 2012 ticket, has said he does not want to run for president this year and disavowed the draft ryan group. with establishment republicans desperately searching for a way to stop real estate businessman and former reality tv personality donald trump’s march toward the party’s nomination for the nov. 8 presidential election, ryan’s name has been mentioned often as an alternative.  but ryan’s political operation, in a letter sent thursday, told the draft ryan group it should not be “misleading people into supporting your organization” and warned of legal risk, saying it believed the group’s actions “may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds.” in its statement friday, the committee acknowledged that neither ryan nor his allies had sanctioned the group. “nor was this, as it was incorrectly described in some media reports, an ‘establishment’ effort to oppose any candidate currently running for president,” the statement said. the effort had been funded by earle mack, a former u.s. ambassador to finland. mack had told the new york times that he would spend up to $1 million on the draft ryan committee.   the organization had wanted to advance the idea that if the  republican convention to formally nominate the party’s candidate was contested, “the best person to lead our country would be speaker paul ryan,” the statement said. it said the group had received a “resounding response from around the country” and was confident that if it had stayed in operation, it would have surpassed its goal of collecting 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft ryan. a spokesman for ryan said in response to friday’s announcement that ryan was grateful for mack’s “passion.” “he (mack) cares deeply about the future of our country. speaker ryan does too, and that’s why he is focused on advancing a bold policy agenda with his house colleagues to unify our party and turn around our country,” the spokesman said. the draft ryan group was only registered with the u.s. federal election commission last week as a super pac, an independent political action committee that may raise unlimited sums of money.

" lpga chief mike whan says the tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the 2017 us women’s open at a course owned by presidential nominee donald trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women. the united states golf association (usga) is facing calls to move the event from trump national golf club in new jersey in nine months’ time after a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. whan told reuters in an interview on saturday at the lpga/klpga co sanctioned keb hana bank championship in incheon that he was “lucky” not to have to make that kind of decision. the u.s. women’s open, the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf, is conducted by the usga.  “in a strange way i’m lucky that the lpga has no direct dealings with donald trump or donald trump properties,” he said. “like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides. i’m not here to be a politician, i know that what the players want is that i don’t get so political as to limit opportunities for women. “all i’ve said to the usga is this, ‘you have long since proven you support women’s golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then we’re right there with you.’” whan took over in 2010 when the lpga tour was buckling from the fallout of the u.s. recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuit’s resurgence. one look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the women’s game — the word “commissioner” emblazoned in english, korean, chinese and japanese. whan said he hoped the global flavor of the tour’s  schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home. “in the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio,” he said of a tour which makes stops in china, japan, malaysia, korea and taiwan in a late season asian swing. more than a third of the circuit’s tournaments are sponsored by asian firms or organizations. “it used to be that one u.s. economic downturn could really cripple the lpga,” he added. “i’m not saying that wouldn’t happen tomorrow, but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally.” whan said now that the tour had been put on a solid footing, with 33 official money events this year compared to 23 in 2011, the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones. “i think we need to be playing for $100 million in purse money,” he said of future targets. “i said that back in 2010 and people thought i was nuts, but that was when we were playing for $30 million. “now we’re play for $65 million and i think we’ll get there.” the decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule, the evian championship, was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the lpga but whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past. “sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional,” he added. “if we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward, then we would have a real problem.” ",0

" michigan governor rick snyder, facing protests, lawsuits and calls for his resignation over drinking water contamination in flint, on tuesday apologized to the city’s residents and called for the state to spend $28 million on fixes. “to you, the people of flint, i say tonight as i have before, i am sorry and i will fix it,” snyder said in his annual speech to lawmakers, adding that federal, state and local leaders had failed residents. snyder, a republican, asked lawmakers to authorize $28 million in spending on diagnostic tests, health treatment for children and adolescents, replacement of old fixtures in flint schools and day care centers and a study of the city’s water pipes. he also said additional funding would be needed. some people have reported rashes, hair loss and other problems since flint, under a state appointed emergency manager,  switched to flint river water in april 2014 from a detroit run water system to save money, attorneys for the residents said. complaints about the water began within a month of the switch, but flint did not return to detroit water until october 2015 after tests showed elevated levels of lead in flint tap water and in some children. the corrosive river water caused more lead to leach from flint pipes than detroit water did, increasing contaminants in the tap water. president barack obama met on tuesday with recently elected flint mayor karen weaver over the crisis, which has become part of the u.s. presidential debate with candidates on both sides questioning the slow response. the u.s. environmental protection agency said it acted too slowly to address the situation in flint. snyder promised to release his flint related emails from 2014 and 2015 on wednesday. he has rejected calls for his resignation by some protesters. “lansing failed in one of its most basic functions, ensuring the well being and health of our citizens,” state house democratic leader tim greimel said after the speech. at least 1,000 people protested at the capitol on tuesday, some holding baby bottles filled with brown water. “the governor has a business agenda and his business agenda was to take over the water to profit in it,” said lila cabbil, a demonstrator from detroit. several lawsuits have been filed. the latest on tuesday asks a judge to stop flint from issuing shutoff notices to residents, who are still receiving bills for water declared undrinkable. attorney cary mcgehee said lawyers have heard from more than 500 people reporting health problems and financial hardships.

" new zealand and australia have begun talks about screening procedures for asylum seekers holding out in a papua new guinea detention center, new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern said on monday, amid reports of worsening health conditions there. australia has been refusing new zealand s offer to take up to 150 of the detainees from the australian run camp on manus island, but ardern s comments have raised speculation that australian prime minister malcolm turnbull is ready to accept.  the center was closed almost three weeks ago after png s high court ruled it was illegal, but more than 400 detainees have refused to leave, citing concerns for their security if they were moved to transit centers as planned. more than 150 men at the center were seriously ill without access to basic first aid or medicine, said advocacy group asylum seeker resource centre (asrc), which is calling for safe resettlement of the men.  a team from the group, which is based in australia, visited the center last wednesday, a spokeswoman said.  the deteriorating state of the men s bodies was obvious to me as i was shown around,  said jana favero, the group s campaigns director.  this is a medical emergency festering inside a humanitarian crisis.    medical conditions requiring urgent care ranged from chest pain and undiagnosed episodes of unconsciousness to infections and chronic diarrhea among others, the group added. turnbull has been refusing new zealand s offer as he worries asylum seekers could view it as a  back door  to australia, undermining the country s tough immigration policies.  ardern said the conversations were about establishing the screening processes.   to be clear, we have not started that process,  she told radio new zealand.  but i think that certainly we re a bit further along than we have been before   we haven t even had officials having those discussions in the past.  the united nations, which has warned of a  looming humanitarian crisis , last week urged australia to accept new zealand s offer to take the men.  turnbull has insisted the priority was an existing refugee swap deal negotiated last year with former u.s. president barack obama. the men holed up in the camp depend on erratic food supplies smuggled in by supporters. they lack power and running water.  australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy that  refuses to let asylum seekers arriving by boat reach its shores has been heavily criticized by the united nations and human rights groups, but has bipartisan domestic political support.

" a massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the united states to build the proposed wall along the mexican border that is one of u.s. president elect donald trump’s most prominent campaign promises. “i can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall,” bristol county sheriff thomas hodgson said at his swearing in ceremony for a fourth term in office late wednesday.  “aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other americans upon release, can be very powerful,” he said. hodgson, who like trump is a republican, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration. trump, who will be sworn in on jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the mexican government to pay for the wall, though mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so. officials in the trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the united states has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated. the federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around the united states that produced about $500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended sept. 30, according to its financial statements. still, an attorney for the american civil liberties union in massachusetts said hodgson’s proposal could violate prisoners’ rights. “the proposal is perverse, it’s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional,” aclu staff counsel laura rotolo said in a phone interview. “it certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in massachusetts or their families. it’s about politics.” in response to a request by the trump transition office, the department of homeland security last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the u.s. mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by reuters.  the document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion.

" there is a  strong likelihood  philippine president rodrigo duterte will lift a suspension on police from his war on drugs, his spokesman said on thursday, a move likely to alarm activists who accuse police of committing murder under the guise of drug busts. amid international concern over the staggering death toll and several killings of youngsters, president rodrigo duterte last month suspended police anti narcotics operations for a second time and put the country s undermanned drugs enforcement agency, pdea, in charge. presidential spokesman harry roque reiterated duterte s concern expressed last week that the drugs problem could intensify and gains might be lost with the philippine national police (pnp) sidelined.  a decision will soon be made,  roque told a regular briefing.  that s the president s call. if he thinks it (the war on drugs) must be returned (to the pnp) then it must be, the pdea has been given enough time.  he added:  effectively he has manifested already a decision to return it to the pnp.  close to 4,000 mostly urban poor filipinos have been killed in what police say are anti drug operations. human rights groups and political opponents say executions of drug users and small time peddlers have been widespread, but police insist those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance. police have rebuffed criticism and cite 117,000 arrests as proof that their policy is to preserve life. they also deny links to at least 2,000 mysterious street killings of drug users. roque said duterte knew the police had flaws and would not tolerate abuses, but he still believed in them.  he suspended police in january and reinstated them five weeks later, arguing that drugs were pouring back to the streets. it is unclear why he removed them again on oct. 11. his directive was to  bring order  to the campaign, but in angry, at times incoherent speeches, he suggested he was trying to appease the international community. duterte last week oversaw his biggest international summit yet but there was no known challenge from other leaders to his war on drugs, including from u.s. president donald trump. the volatile duterte did, however, lash out afterwards about canadian prime minister justin trudeau, calling it an  insult  that he should express his concern to him. phelim kine, deputy director of human rights watch in asia, said people should  brace for more bloodshed  and called again for a united nations led international investigation.  until that happens, the number of victims denied justice and accountability will likely only continue to grow,  he wrote in a web posting.

" democrats in california’s state senate announced on tuesday a series of infrastructure funding bills that would invest billions in roads, bridges, housing and water projects. infrastructure investment has been at the forefront of political agendas this year, from president elect donald trump’s promise to unveil a massive national infrastructure spending plan to voters’ support of billions of dollars of infrastructure bonds in november’s election. both trump and his rival, hillary clinton, campaigned promising infrastructure investment. trump called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years, but it remains unclear how much would come from the federal budget. democrats in the california senate proposed five bills on tuesday, including one that would use $6 billion a year over the next decade to repair roads and bridges and improve transit systems across the state.  according to the proposal, the bulk of the money is to be raised through a phased in 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase, along with increases to the diesel excise tax and vehicle registration fees. california’s freeway system faces a $59 billion maintenance shortfall over the next decade and local governments face another $78 billion shortfall for local highways and bridges. the need for infrastructure funding is echoed across the country.  “our transportation infrastructure is in dire condition. the longer we wait to fix it, the more it will cost us,” state senator jim beall of san jose and sponsor of the transportation bill, said in a statement. two housing bills raise money for affordable housing, one of them through a $75 fee on real estate transaction documents. california is home to 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, and many parts of the state face serious housing shortages. another bill proposes to issue a $3 billion general obligation bond aimed at addressing the housing stock shortage. senator toni atkins of san diego, sponsor of one of the housing bills, said infrastructure was “at the top of the list” of challenges facing california, and tuesday’s package of bills would “go a long way toward improving quality of life for californians and grow our state’s economy.” another bill would fund state and local parks and water infrastructure through a $3 billion general obligation bond. despite recent rains, california is in the fifth year of  drought. in 2014, state voters passed a $7.5 billion bond to fund water infrastructure projects throughout california.  senate leader kevin de león of los angeles, sponsor of tuesday’s bill, noted that there is still “a high unmet demand for new water and natural resource investment.” ",0
" the kremlin may have spent years reviling america, but russians  hoping donald trump will usher in a new era of detente marked his inauguration on friday with parties and trinkets from commemorative coins to “matryoshka” nesting dolls in his image. washington was turned into a virtual fortress with an estimated 900,000 people — backers and protesters — descending on the capital. in london, anti trump activists draped a banner reading “build bridges not walls” from tower bridge. protests were planned across western europe on friday and saturday.  but according to gennady gudkov, a putin critic and former lawmaker, russia is in the grip of “trumpomania”, with state media giving the president elect blanket air time at the expense of more mundane and sometimes depressing domestic news stories. that, he said, was in part because the u.s. election, unlike elections in russia, had been unpredictable. the kremlin is hoping trump will ease sanctions imposed over the annexation of crimea, team up with russia against islamic state, and cut back nato military activity near russian borders. craftsmen in the city of zlatoust, east of moscow, have released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with “in trump we trust”   an allusion to the phrase on u.s. banknotes “in god we trust”. sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added trump dolls to their popular line up of items carved in the likeness of president vladimir putin, bolshevik revolutionary vladimir lenin, ex president mikhail gorbachev and josef stalin. and a shop selling russian military kit located opposite the u.s. embassy in moscow has unveiled a cheeky promotional campaign offering embassy employees and u.s. citizens a 10 percent discount on its wares to celebrate trump’s inauguration. some of trump’s opponents believe the kremlin helped him win the white house by staging a hacking campaign to hoover up embarrassing information about hillary clinton, his rival. the kremlin denies that, but few here make any secret of the fact that they are pleased that trump and not clinton triumphed.   relations between putin and barack obama had soured badly.   “trump’s election has generated enormous enthusiasm in russia because his warm words about russia and putin have given us hope that the usa and the west will stop their attack on russia,” sergei markov, a former pro putin lawmaker, said on social media. “we don’t know for sure if there will be an improvement (in relations) or not. but we russians are optimists ... so we are hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.” for russian nationalists, trump’s inauguration is an excuse to mix fun with self promotion. they are holding an all night party at what used to be the main soviet era post office in moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a  triptych of putin, trump and french front national leader marine le pen. konstantin rykov, a former pro putin lawmaker and one of the event’s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the “new world order.”       “washington will be ours,” he quipped.

" four u.s. senators   two democrats and two republicans   introduced a bill on tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market. senators charles grassley, chair of the judiciary committee, and patrick leahy, the top democrat, are sponsors of the bill along with senators mike lee and amy klobuchar, the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top democrat, respectively. the food and drug administration, which ensures the safety of the country’s food and drug supply, has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, called rems, which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely. but there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions. generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol, making it difficult to come to market. the bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol. “balancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task. it’s a consistent topic at my town meetings,” grassley said in a statement. “unfortunately, we’re seeing some brand name drug companies engage in anti competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market. this bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated.” there is a similar bill in the house of representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy. for example, it requires the generic company seeking a rems drug to get fda authorization to obtain the sample. in one of the rems disputes which is public, mylan pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in 2014 against celgene corp, accusing it of using rems to prevent generic copies of thalomid and revlimid to market. the senate judiciary committee’s antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on june 21. the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america, or phrma, which counts major drugmakers among its members, said it had no immediate comment. the generic pharmaceutical association was pleased to see the bill introduced. “it is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings,” said chip davis, gpha’s president. “continued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome.” ",0
" the four arab countries boycotting qatar added 11 more individuals and two other entities, including a major group of islamist scholars, to their  terrorist  blacklists for the gulf state, saudi state news agency spa reported on thursday. the lists now include the qatar based international union of muslim scholars (iums) which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the muslim brotherhood and is chaired by the influential sheikh youssef al qaradawi.  a statement issued by saudi arabia, egypt, the united arab emirates (uae) and bahrain said they also blacklisted the international islamic council (iic).   the two entities listed are two terrorist organizations that promote terrorism by using islamic rhetoric as a cover to facilitate terrorist activities,  the statement said. the move deepened the rift between the four countries and qatar, the world s top gas exporter and host to the biggest u.s. military base in the middle east. the countries cut ties with qatar in june, accusing it of financing militants in syria and allying with iran, their regional foe. the saudi led quartet also added 11 individuals to their lists, including the acting brotherhood leader mahmoud ezzat ibrahim. the muslim brotherhood movement led the arab spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the middle east and north africa. the gulf states  rulers see the group, whose political ideology challenges the principle of dynastic rule, as a security threat. the iums membership includes the saudi cleric salman al awdah, who was arrested by saudi authorities in september, the tunisian rached ghannouchi, head of the ennahda party, and moroccan scholar ahmed raissouni. mediation efforts of the qatar crisis led by kuwait and shuttle diplomacy by western officials, including u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, have failed to end what has become the worst rift between gulf arab states in years.

" in a telephone call, u.s. president elect donald trump told vietnam’s prime minister he wanted to further strengthen fast warming ties between the two countries, the government of the southeast asian nation said on thursday. vietnam has advanced ties with the united states to a new level under the obama administration as it faces down communist neighbor china’s challenge to its territorial claims in the busy waterway of the south china sea.    during wednesday’s conversation, vietnamese premier nguyen xuan phuc congratulated trump on his election win and stressed the importance of maintaining friendship and cooperation. “president elect trump spoke highly of the achievements of vietnam, as well as the positive developments in bilateral ties,” vietnam’s government said on its news website. “he also asserted his wish to cooperate with vietnam to accelerate the relationship between the two countries.” trump has had conversations with several leaders of countries locked in maritime disputes with china, among them japan, the philippines and taiwan. his trade platform runs counter to vietnam’s interests, however, with his opposition to a trans pacific partnership proving a major setback for southeast asia’s biggest exporter to the united states. trump and phuc discussed ways to promote economic ties, trade and investment, the government added. in a statement, trump’s transition team confirmed the conversation, saying the two men “discussed a range of shared interests and agreed to work together to continue strengthening the relationship between the two nations”. just days after trump’s win, phuc told parliament that ratification of the tpp would be shelved because of political changes in the united states, but vietnam still wanted good relations with washington.    in a separate development, a u.s. guided missile destroyer, the mustin, visited cam ranh international port on thursday in a routine technical stop, the u.s. embassy said.  the ship’s visit was “an example of the depth of our comprehensive partnership and the importance of strengthening our civilian and military ties,” said u.s. ambassador ted osius. vietnam has expressed support for the united states to maintain its security presence in asia. washington fully lifted a u.s. lethal arms embargo on vietnam in may, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises.

"during a sit down with trump voters, cnn got their take on the alleged president s first 100 days. with polls showing trump as the most unpopular president in history, some of the former reality show star s most ardent supporters have stood by him but others are fed up. one trump supporter has had it with trump s broken promises, such as the vow to work on the opioid epidemic spreading across america. another trump voter, scott mccommons, said that he was  disappointed  with trump s first 100 days, calling it was a  disaster. he s got enough time to get on twitter, and rant and rave, and on top of that lie on twitter,  he said.  i voted for the man to make america great again, and i m willing to give him a chance, but he s not doing what i thought, that he made promises at rallies that i went to. i expected him to work a little harder [on health care],  he continued.  be a little more reasonable instead of threatening people. that s unpresidential. i voted to send him to washington strictly because i thought he would make change, nobody would push him around. he s used his power against people, i think that s wrong. gt s been a disaster, i think, in the first 100 days. if i were to vote tomorrow, i would not vote for him,  he added.watch courtesy of cnn:as the cnn host pointed out, trump campaigned as the ultimate deal maker. one strong supporter of trump s blamed house speaker paul ryan for that. mccommons said trump  isn t willing to sit down at the table and negotiate. if only trump supporters were warned that the alleged billionaire was a con man. oh wait, they were. and now, here we are having to deal with a hot mess as donald trump once again targets millions of americans  health care while still insisting that mexico will pay for his vanity-wall.image via screen capture",1
" the top democrat on the u.s. senate intelligence committee said on wednesday there was “more investigating to do” after top intelligence officials declined to answer questions about whether president donald trump attempted to interfere in the investigation of alleged russian meddling in the u.s. election. “our intelligence leaders could have laid allegations against (trump) to rest. they chose not to and didn’t explain why they wouldn’t answer,” senator mark warner said in a statement on twitter after a committee hearing. “that tells me we have more investigating to do,” he wrote.

" britain s prince george, the great grandson of queen elizabeth and third in line to the throne, started school on thursday but without his pregnant mother kate to support him because she is suffering from severe morning sickness. george, 4, was taken by his father, prince william, from their kensington palace home to thomas s battersea school in southwest london, which says its most important rule is to  be kind  and charges almost 18,000 pounds ($23,490) per pupil per year.  we expect our pupils to make impressive progress as a result of their own hard work, the best efforts of their teachers, the judicious support of their parents and the encouragement of their peers,  the school says on its website. a nervous looking george, wearing a school uniform of dark shorts and a navy jumper with red trim, held his father s hand as the head of lower school, helen haslem, escorted the royal duo to his classroom.  his mother kate missed the occasion due to acute morning sickness and has canceled other engagements this week after the palace announced on monday that she was expecting her third child. like his parents, george and his younger sister charlotte have already appeared on the front covers of magazines around the world and this summer they traveled on official royal tours of poland and germany where crowds cheered them.

" european union leaders will promise during talks in brussels   sufficient and targeted funding  for migration projects in africa and elsewhere, according to a draft statement that shows they have yet to put their money where their mouth is.  the eu has spent billions of euros in recent years on keeping a lid on immigration from the middle east and africa after a 2015 peak in arrivals overwhelmed the bloc and fueled support for populist, right wing and anti immigration groups.     in 2016, the eu promised turkey at least 3 billion euros over two years for the syrian refugees it hosts in exchange for ankara cutting off the migratory route to greece. it has so far contracted to pay nearly 1.7 billion of that and disbursed 900 million.  the bloc has been giving money to greece and italy, the main eu countries of arrival for refugees and migrants crossing the mediterranean, spending on tightening external borders, as well as financing more deportations from europe and providing training and equipment to the libyan border and coast guard. italy has led eu s efforts on the lawless libya, where the bloc is also funding u.n. programs to send people back home further south in africa   so that they do not try to cross to europe   and improve the miserable conditions in camps where migrants are often stuck. the bloc decided to sponsor many other projects in africa, including in niger, to promote growth and slow emigration. but eu governments have been slow to chip in to the so called africa trust fund, with one senior eu diplomat saying on wednesday the shortfall is in the  high tens of millions  of euros.       if the situation is not fixed quickly, we might find ourselves in a position that we cannot carry out our policies,  the diplomat said.  some eu states have been hesitant to pay, saying not all projects proposed under the africa scheme were clearly tied to keeping a lid on migration to europe, or complaining about funds going to waste because of mismanagement or corruption.   you need to know what that money will be spent on and that has not been entirely clear so far. you need to know who will benefit from this money,  another senior eu diplomat said.  an eu official summed up the atmosphere around the table by saying:  there is no trust in the africa trust fund.   asked what does the eu   which will hold a high profile summit with african partners in abidjan on nov.28 29   need to solve this headache, the person added:  a big pot of money.  beyond discussing financing to keep immigration to the bloc under control, eu leaders meeting in brussels on thursday and friday will praise italy for its efforts in libya the eu has faced heavy criticism from rights groups that the bloc is turning into a fortress, deprives refugees and migrants of their rights and exposes them to even more suffering. brussels says investing in africa could help prevent migrants from seeking to trek north and risk their lives in deadly crossings through the sahara and the mediterranean. after more than a million people crossed the sea in 2015, the number stood at 363,000 in 2016 and is below 160,000 so far this year, according to data from the united nations and eu border agency frontex. frontex said on wednesday the 156,000 arrivals this year via all four main routes   leading to greece, italy, spain and south east eu states   mark a two third fall from a year ago. with emotions surrounding migration having subsided somewhat from the 2015 peak, eu leaders will also touch on how to handle those asylum seekers who make it onto european shores, an issue that has divided them for two years now.  frontline southern states and wealthy countries that receive most asylum seekers have sought to require other countries to take more in; eastern eu members have refused. estonia, currently the bloc s rotating chairman, will make anther proposal at squaring the circle days after the summit.   the positions have not changed much but there is a slight shift maybe for a broad agreement,  another senior eu diplomat said.  sources said the proposal to reform the bloc s asylum rules will still include some version of an obligatory or automated relocation scheme for times of high arrivals. that has long been opposed by poland, slovakia, hungary and the czech republic, and may be too watered down to win backing from greece or italy.

" officials with the conservative u.s. political network overseen by the koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the senate this week and will lobby for changes to it. at a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to charles koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, also known as obamacare. “we have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,” said tim phillips, president of americans for prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by charles koch and his brother, david. the senate’s 142 page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by senate majority leader mcconnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of president donald trump to repeal obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million americans since its passage in 2010. republicans view the law, formally called the affordable care act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. phillips and other aides to the koch network told reuters they want to see the senate bill do more to roll back obamacare’s expansion of the medicaid program for poor and disabled americans. they also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the u.s. healthcare system and cut costs. the aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote. similar concerns helped steer the house’s version of the bill in a more conservative direction. a primary mover of that effort, mark meadows, a republican congressman from north carolina, attended the koch donor event. meadows, chairman of the conservative freedom caucus in the house, said he is prepared to support the senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on trump’s desk is possible. however, meadows said the senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on obamacare’s insurance exchanges to offer less expensive plans that do not comply with that law’s coverage requirements. republican senator ted cruz of texas, who currently opposes the senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. cruz attended the koch event here, as did senators jeff flake of arizona and ben sasse of nebraska, who remain undecided. meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes. senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the july 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the house. if the senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the house, meadows said it is conceivable the house could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the senate and house bills. that, he said, could result in sending the bill to trump’s desk for his signature before the recess. getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult. five senate republicans, including cruz, have publicly voiced their opposition to the current senate draft. no senate democrats are expected to back it, which means mcconnell cannot afford to lose more than two senate republicans. as a sign of the koch network’s influence, phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as $400 million before next year’s congressional elections to advocate for the network’s conservative causes.

" president donald trump is more popular with likely voters than he is with the general public, according to a reuters/ipsos poll that underscores why republican lawmakers have largely stuck with the polarizing president despite his plunging approval ratings. the poll, released on wednesday, shows he polls better among people who voted in the 2016 presidential election than with the overall u.s. adult population – a group that includes both voters and non voters. only about 60 percent of the voting age public took part in last year’s election. in october, for example, 44 percent of 2016 voters said they approved of trump’s performance in office, compared with 37 percent of the general population. among republicans, 82 percent of voters approved of trump in october, compared with 75 percent of all republicans. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zoic1a) some 85 percent of those who voted for trump in 2016 said they would do so again, the poll found. the findings suggest that republican candidates in the 2018 congressional elections who shun the president risk alienating his followers, republican strategists and political scientists said. at the same time, those who embrace him in the early primary races that choose party candidates risk losing moderate voters in the general election. “it’s very difficult for any republican candidate to distance themselves from trump,” said michael mcdonald, an expert on voter turnout at the university of florida.  that dilemma played out in virginia on tuesday, when ed gillespie, the republican candidate in the governor’s race, was soundly beaten by his democratic opponent. gillespie had adopted some of trump’s hardline positions but had avoided campaigning with the unpopular president.  gillespie’s strategy had been closely watched within the party to see if it could provide a template for other republican candidates in 2018, when control of the house of representatives and the senate will be up for grabs. gillespie’s loss sparked debate among republicans on the way forward on wednesday. trump suggested in a tweet that the outcome could have been different had gillespie fully embraced him, but critics pointed out that exit polls showed that a third of virginian voters had turned out to signal displeasure with trump, double the number who cast ballots to express support for the president.  tuesday’s results clearly signal that opposition to trump has grown, even though he remains popular among 2016 republican voters, said elaine kamarck, an expert in presidential politics at the brookings institution.  for republicans, “the hurdle won’t be with getting out the base,” kamarck said. “it will be in getting anyone else to vote for you” in elections where republican voters are outnumbered. reuters/ipsos was able to compare the opinions of voters with the general public by creating two separate surveys: a poll of voters and a poll of the public.  for the voter poll, reuters/ipsos reconnected with people who took its exit poll on nov. 8, 2016, the day of the u.s. presidential election. those voters were sent additional questionnaires in may, july and october that asked if they approved or disapproved of the president.  their responses were then compared with the results of a separate survey – the reuters/ipsos national tracking poll – that surveys all adults in the united states. in may and july, the results of both polls were nearly identical, with about 40 percent of voters and the general adult population expressing approval for the president. the two polls diverged in october, however, with voters expressing stronger levels of approval than the general public.  jan leighley, an expert on political behavior at american university, said it makes sense that trump is more popular among people who voted in the 2016 election. they were more likely to be white and less likely to identify with democrats than the general public, she said.  the reuters/ipsos poll is conducted online in english throughout the country. some 1,206 of those 2016 voters took the  survey between may 10 12, followed by 1,296 who took the july 11 12 survey and 1,195 who took the survey between oct. 18 19.  individual responses were weighted so they would reflect the latest population estimates, as well as the support their presidential pick received in the election. each of the voter polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for republican voters.

" china has leverage to persuade north korea to go back to talks over its nuclear ambitions, french foreign minister jean yves le drian said on friday, after meeting with his chinese counterpart wang yi. north korea s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles has fueled a surge in regional tensions as united nations led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change its behavior. western diplomats have said that china is largely responsible for patchy enforcement. but beijing bristles at the notion that it should be doing more to rein in north korea, which does about 90 percent of its trade with china, saying it is fully enforcing u.n. sanctions and that everyone has a responsibility to lower tension and get talks back on track.  we want to force the negotiations ... and it s true that china is well placed to push,  le drian told reporters during a joint briefing with wang after arriving in beijing for a four day visit. a military solution was an  extreme  option, he said. china advocates for a  dual suspension  plan to address the issue in which pyongyang would halt its nuclear and missile programs and washington would stop military exercises with its allies in the region, though u.s. president donald trump has ruled it out. wang said the proposition is  realistic and feasible .  france thought it was a real proposition but that the conditions to realize it have not been met. but if we don t have the conditions we have to create the conditions,  wang said. le drian countered that he didn t see it as the right approach.   i don t believe much in the double suspension strategy, because first of all [north korea] isn t prepared to negotiate the very principle of this nuclear program,  le drian said. le drian has said previously that bellicose statements by trump and north korean leader kim jong un have created fears of a dangerous miscalculation, particularly since pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3. washington this week imposed sanctions on 13 chinese and north korean organizations washington accused of helping evade nuclear restrictions against pyongyang and supporting the country through trade of commodities like coal.  the u.s. treasury also put north korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism. but north korea last week ruled out negotiations with washington as long as joint u.s south korea military exercises continue, and said that pyongyang s atomic weapons program would remain as a deterrent against a u.s. nuclear threat.  the air forces of south korea and the united states are scheduled to hold a regular joint drill in december, which will include hundreds of aircraft and about 12,000 u.s. personnel.

" three georgian military personnel serving with the nato led resolute support mission in afghanistan were lightly wounded when their vehicle was attacked near an airbase north of the capital kabul, officials said. none of their injuries was considered life threatening, resolute support spokesman capt. tom gresback said in an emailed statement on thursday.  during a recent patrol south of bagram airfield yesterday afternoon, three georgian service members suffered minor injuries when a motorcycle borne ied (improvised explosive device) was detonated next to their patrol,  he said. the attack came as nato prepares to send more troops to afghanistan to support a new u.s. strategy aimed at breaking the stalemate with the taliban. georgia, one of the largest contributing nations to the 13,500 strong resolute support mission, has around 870 troops in afghanistan, behind only germany, italy and the united states. in august, a georgian soldier was killed and six other coalition personnel were wounded in an attack on a convoy in qarabagh district, the area in which wednesday s attack occurred.

" defying opinion polls and expert predictions, democratic hopeful bernie sanders aims to seize the party’s white house nomination from hillary clinton’s grasp with a last ditch come from behind triumph in california. by far the most populous u.s. state, california is the largest prize of the state by state nominating contests, and the vote on june 7 is one of the last before democrats convene in july to select a nominee for the nov. 8 presidential election. an aggressive schedule of large rallies is planned along with heavy purchases of tv, radio and online advertising in three languages and a “far, far more expensive” campaign effort than in any other state, sanders campaign sources disclosed. “i think they’re still riding rainbow unicorns if they think there’s a path,” said steve schale, a florida based strategist, of sanders’ bid for the white house. california has been a reliable source of campaign funds for clinton, and opinion polls show her ahead there by as many as 14 percentage points. the statistical analysis media site fivethirtyeight gives her a 91 percent chance of winning the state primary.         the sanders campaign push aims to net as much as a 10 point win in california, helping him deny the front running clinton the 2,383 convention delegates she needs to clinch the nomination and give him the momentum to force a contested convention where he can try to win over the “superdelegates,” those not decided by a state nominating contest and free to support anyone, the campaign sources said. sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, has eroded clinton’s lead in california, according to a field poll released on friday. clinton led sanders by only 6 points in that survey, down from a double digit lead earlier this year. “with california what we’re going to do is something that (sanders) really likes to do: barnstorm the place,” said tad devine, sanders’ senior adviser, acknowledging sanders’ underdog status against clinton, the former secretary of state. that means two or three large scale rallies a day for weeks, possibly starting in late april to target early voters, he said. such rallies are a sweet spot for the 74 year old new york born democratic socialist’s firebrand speaking style championing the working class and vowing to erase economic inequality. at a late march event in the bronx, he drew 18,500 people. clinton leads in pledged convention delegates   those allocated to candidates on the basis of the state primaries and caucuses   with 1,287 to 1,037 for sanders.  a candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. california has 475 delegates, to be divided proportionally according to the june 7 primary vote. the clinton campaign plans to put up a fight. local and national surrogates will speak out in english and spanish and staff will beef up offices up and down the west coast as the california vote nears, her campaign said. “we’re fighting for every vote by talking to californians about why hillary clinton is the only candidate in this race who will break down the barriers that hold people back and deliver real results,” amanda renteria, hillary for america national political director, said in a statement to reuters.  “headed into the june 7 primary, our volunteers and supporters are knocking on doors and hitting the phones to share with friends, family and neighbors hillary clinton’s plans to create more good paying jobs in california, keep our streets safe from gun violence, protect our environment, reform our immigration system and ensure all californians have access to a good education and quality affordable health care.” sanders has won seven of the last eight state nominating battles but faces a potentially rougher road in big states like new york, where clinton was a u.s. senator and which holds an april 19 primary. sanders aims to overcome the edge that clinton, wife of former president bill clinton, has enjoyed with minorities. larry cohen, a senior adviser to the campaign, said the campaign aims to match or outdo the 10,000 volunteers it enlisted in new york by drawing on the labor for bernie volunteer group, local and national unions and other groups. “we’ll certainly do spanish language advertising,” sanders’ campaign manager jeff weaver said. devine said that vietnamese was also part of the plan. the languages are nods to california’s large populations of latino and asian voters. weaver compared california to michigan, where sanders notched a surprise win in early march after advertising in arabic to woo the state’s

" republicans pressed ahead in their deregulatory push on tuesday, with the u.s. house of representatives rules committee officially adding a regulation on methane and one intended to root out pay discrimination to the list of rules the whole chamber will vote to kill on wednesday. on monday, the committee sent three other recently enacted rules on the environment, corruption and guns to the full house to axe under the congressional review act, which has only been used effectively once, in 2001.  the republican controlled house is expected to vote to overturn all five regulations on wednesday, and then hand them off to the senate. agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation, and democrats at tuesday’s committee hearing argued that house republicans were closing off the possibility of enacting regulations that could be needed in the future.  they also pressed for more time to consider rolling back regulations that often took months and years to craft. “what we’ve been doing today and yesterday ... i would characterize as mindless legislating,” said representative jim mcgovern, a democrat from massachusetts. “i worry that this whole process is going to subject a lot of vulnerable people, and a lot of working people, as well as our environment to some pretty dark consequences.” new york’s louise slaughter, the committee’s senior democrat, while talking about the methane rule during the one hour hearing bluntly said: “i disagree wholeheartedly with what you’re doing.” democrats, though, have little power to stop the overturning of regulations. only simple majorities in both chambers are needed to kill a rule. in the past, republicans’ nullification attempts were met with veto threats by former president barack obama, a democrat. now, a fellow republican occupies the white house, president donald trump. critics of the methane rule say the regulation, which covers emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and indian land, is not necessary. they cast it as a duplicative regulation that usurps state rights and slows down the distribution of natural gas through excessive red tape. supporters, meanwhile, say that the rule keeps oil and gas companies from polluting the environment, brings in royalties to the federal government, and reduces wasted methane. those wanting to see the pay discrimination rule overturned have similar complaints, saying that other rules already cover the area and that requiring federal contractors to collect information on their employees will be expensive and time consuming.

" president barack obama will propose tailoring the controversial “cadillac tax” on expensive private health insurance plans to reflect regional differences when he releases his 2017 budget plan next week, a senior white house adviser said in an article released on wednesday. obama's proposal would reduce the bite of the unpopular tax by raising the threshold where it takes effect in areas where healthcare is particularly expensive, according to the article in the new england journal of medicine co written by jason furman, chairman of the white house council of economic advisers. (bit.ly/1qdgldg) the tax on high cost employer based healthcare plans, passed as part of the president’s 2010 affordable care act and set to take effect in 2018, has generated growing opposition in part because labor unions say it could encourage employers to cut back on health insurance plans for workers. the tax was expected to raise some $87 billion a year to help pay for the reform generally known as obamacare.   white house officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" the legal battle over transgender rights between the state of north carolina and the u.s. government has moved the country closer to settling one of the last frontiers in civil rights law.  at issue is whether transgender people deserve the same federal protections that have been extended to groups such as blacks and religious minorities. backers of the north carolina law, which requires people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity, say it will protect women and girls from predators. transgender advocates say that claim is unfounded and ignores a modern understanding of people who identify with a gender other than the one assigned at birth.  the next step is likely to be a federal judge’s decision on whether to impose an injunction, or temporary ruling, to void the north carolina law pending a trial. regardless of how a judge might rule on an injunction, the case stands to add to a growing body of legal decisions that have tended to side in favor of transgender rights but not enough to dissuade states like north carolina.  a handful of u.s. states and cities have attempted to enact measures affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, but north carolina is the first state to focus on transgender people’s use of public bathrooms.    “this is absolutely a critical moment in terms of the focus and the answers that will come through these cases about the established scope of protections for transgender people,” said jennifer levi, a lawyer with glbtq legal advocates & defenders. the north carolina law is the subject of four lawsuits in federal court, two on each side. the u.s. justice department and an advocacy group, the american civil liberties union, have each sought to strike it down, saying the law violates the landmark civil rights act of 1964, which jolted a divided nation into applying full rights to african americans a century after the abolition of slavery. north carolina’s governor and legislature both sued on monday to protect their law, saying the justice department was trying to strike down a “common sense privacy policy” meant to protect the state’s public employees. state officials also said if the obama administration wants protections for transgender people, it should appeal to congress to amend existing laws. at least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex — title vii of the civil rights act, which covers and employment, and title ix of the education amendments of 1972. the issue before the courts is whether “sex” also applies to gender identity. the obama administration has taken a firm stance that transgender people are protected, a point that attorney general loretta lynch emphasized on monday. “the entire obama administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward,” lynch told transgender people in remarks at a news conference.  lynch also threatened to withhold federal funding to the north carolina department of public safety and the university of north carolina while the legal case proceeds. north carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down from the law, according to an analysis by lawyers at the university of california, los angeles law school. unless north carolina backs down, any ruling by a trial judge would likely be challenged and end up in a virginia based federal appeals court that only weeks ago issued an important ruling in favor of transgender rights. that court, the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit, said a transgender teen from virginia could sue his high school for being barred from using the boy’s bathroom. the court noted that federal education officials have interpreted title ix to apply to transgender people but did not directly rule on the issue.  so far, only one appeals court has explicitly ruled that the civil rights act prohibits discrimination against transgender people, in a 2005 case brought by a police officer. at least five other appeals courts have suggested that they agreed, some in cases involving other federal discrimination laws. the u.s. supreme court could help settle the matter, but experts said it was unlikely to take up any precedent setting case any time soon.

" illegal miners in south africa are swallowing unrefined gold and platinum in condoms as a new tactic to avoid arrest for smuggling that is costing the industry $1.5 billion a year, the police told parliament on friday. illegal mining has plagued south africa s mining sector for decades, and extends from small time pilfering to global organized crime networks.  the crime costs the industry and government an estimated 20 billion rand ($1.5 billion) a year in lost sales, taxes and royalties, the chamber of mines, an industry body, says.  they are ingesting the amalgam concealed in condoms and this is done for two principle reasons. one is to be able to bypass mine security and the other is also to prevent being robbed by opposing groups,  brigadier ebrahim kadwa, a commander in south africa s hawks organized crime unit, said, showing parliament slides of gold filled condoms in miners  x rays. potentially toxic clumps of mercury and gold concentrate  can be refined to extract gold once passed through the body. illegal mining in south africa involves a complex criminal web that extends from desperate unemployed workers, many from neighboring countries, to gun toting gang bosses and front companies exporting refined products to global markets.  the threat posed by illicit mining and related crimes continues to proliferate across the country,  kadwa said, adding that the majority of incidents were in gold mines owned by harmony gold and sibanye. however, hundreds of incidents occurred throughout the country and targeted other minerals such as diamonds and chrome. high rates of unemployment and a stagnant economy helped entice illegal miners to the dangerous work, which is also being driven by rising commodity prices.  kadwa said a weakening of the rand currency between december 2015 to april 2016, saw the relative gold price rise, encouraging illegal smuggling. in february, 22 illegal miners were given lengthy sentences after being found guilty of 577 charges, ranging from theft of gold to racketeering and money laundering.  this is a landmark moment in the fight against illegal mining in the country,  kadwa said.

"trump s new un ambassador nikki haley just held her first press conference following the un security council s monthly meeting on middle east issues, and this was no ordinary press conference. after watching this video, it s easy to see why president trump chose her to represent the us in hopes of redefining our support for democracy in the middle east, while identifying nations who support terrorism. here s an excerpt of her speech to the press:   the security council just finished its regular monthly meeting on middle east issues. it s the first meeting like that that i ve attended, and i have to say it was a bit strange. the security council is supposed to discuss how to maintain international peace and security. but in our meeting on the middle east, the discussion was not about hezbollah s illegal build up of rockets in lebanon. it was not about the money and weapons iran supplies to terrorists. it was not about how we defeat isis.  it was not about how we hold bashar assad accountable for the slaughter of hundreds and thousands of civilians. no, instead the meeting focused on criticizing israel, the one true democracy in the middle east. i am new around here, but i understand that s how the council has operated month after month for decades. i am here to say the united states will not turn a blind eye to this anymore. i am here to underscore the iron-clad support of the united states for israel. a star is born is our reaction to the first press briefing by president trump s new ambassador at the united nations. the ex-governor of south carolina was ridiculed by the left when the president first sent her nomination up to the hill, owing to her alleged lack of foreign policy chops. she certainly rang the wake up gong for that crowd this morning, after emerging from her first security council monthly meeting devoted to the middle east. tough as nails but with a smile and a layer of southern charm.the ambassador had just come from the regular monthly security council on middle east issues. she said it was her first such meeting, and  it was a bit strange.  the security council, she said, is supposed to discuss how to maintain international peace and security. but the meeting, she said, was not about hezbollah s illegal buildup of rockets in lebanon, it was not about the money and weapons iran provides to terrorists, it was not how we defeat isis, it was not how we hold beshar al-assad accountable for the slaughter of thousands of civilians. no,  she said,  instead the meeting focused on criticizing israel, the one true democracy in the middle east. i am new around here, but i understand that s how the council has operated month after month for decades. i am here to say the united states will not turn a blind eye to this anymore. i am here to underscore to the ironclad support of the united states for israel. i am here to emphasize that the united states is determined to stand up to the u.n. s anti-israel bias. the ambassador made clear that the trump administration will not support the kind of resolution from which the obama administration s ambassador   samantha power   shamefully abstained, though mrs. haley was too polite to name the humiliated ms. power.  the outrageously biased resolutions from the security council and the general assembly only make peace harder to attain by discouraging one of the parties from going to the negotiating table. incredibly,  mrs. haley said,  the u.n. department of political affairs has an entire division devoted entirely to palestinian affairs. imagine that. there is no division devoted to illegal missile launches form north korea. there is no division devoted to the world s number one state sponsor of terror, iran. the prejudiced approach to israeli-palestinian issues does the peace process no favors, and it bears no relationship to the reality of the world around us. the double standards are breathtaking. the ambassador warned that it is  the u.n. s anti-israel bias that is long overdue for change,  and said america will not hesitate to speak out in defense of its friend in israel. all this was going on while the press was questioning president trump on what he was going to do about anti-semitism. if his ambassador to the world body is any example, the answer is plenty. she has the principles of a daniel patrick moynihan, the grit of a john bolton, and the star power of a jeane kirkpatrick, and in her first press briefing she certainly made her point.   editorial of the new york sun",1
" senate agriculture committee chairman pat roberts is turning up the heat on the u.s. derivatives and commodities regulator over an accounting error that could mean it has deficient funds. roberts, a kansas republican, sent a letter dated feb. 3 to timothy massad, head of the commodity futures trading commission, calling for answers on the error, according to the committee. the letter included a list of 11 questions for the cftc to answer and a request for a detailed briefing before feb. 17. pressure has mounted on the agency since last month after reuters reported that auditing firm kpmg took the extremely rare action of withdrawing nearly a decade of financial opinions about the agency’s accounts when it learned of a significant material error related to leases. the auditor estimated the cftc had understated liabilities by $194 million in the year to sept. 30, 2015, and by $212 million the previous year. lawmakers are concerned that the cftc has violated a federal law prohibiting government agencies from obligating or spending federal funds in excess of the amount available. the nonpartisan federal watchdog, the government accountability office, is  investigating whether the leasing errors put the cftc afoul of the anti deficiency law. “what i find particularly troubling is in 2011 the u.s. securities and exchange commission faced a similar dilemma concerning its leasing practices and how it accounted for its leases,” roberts wrote, referring to the top u.s. securities regulator. “considering the similarity between the agencies, the similarity of the issues, the public congressional inquiries and the gravity of errant accounting, i am bewildered as to how cftc finds itself in this current state of affairs.” the questions roberts posed revolve around how much guidance kpmg and the white house’s office of management and budget provided the cftc. he also asked about the accounting practices the commission uses and how closely it monitors its books.

" u.s. hedge fund managers began warming to president donald trump soon after his surprise election ignited a powerful stock market rally. now, his dramatic tax cut plans give them even more reasons to cheer. trump, looking to make good on pledges for sweeping tax reform, on wednesday unveiled plans for a cut in the tax rate to 15 percent for so called pass through businesses. while the proposal is being billed as a boon for small businesses from pizzerias to investment management firms, one clear winner looks to be the hedge fund set, where owners can earn hundreds of millions in income a year, tax experts, managers, and their lawyers said on wednesday. “for hedge funds, this is an unmitigated benefit as their tax liabilities could drop significantly,” said robert willens, an independent tax consultant. “obviously, they are quite enthusiastic and there may be a few fist bumps along the way.” a manager whose hedge fund earns $50 million a year, for example, would be paying some $19.8 million in taxes, or 39.6 percent, under the current rules. that could drop to as little as $7.5 million if the rate were cut to 15 percent. to be sure, trump’s plan has a long, hard road to becoming reality, but that didn’t stop fund managers from blitzing their tax lawyers with calls about how to play it. most attorneys advised patience, saying they would need to wait at least until early june, when a bill with more specific language might be hammered out. “if the goal is to get people talking, then it is working,” said jeffrey parker, a partner at law firm eisneramper. “a proposal is just a proposal. the final version often differs significantly from the final draft.” aside from the pass through proposal, an open question is what kind of treatment will be given to so called carried interest. that allows managers to pay a tax rate as low as 20 percent, a loophole that trump has railed against in the past. similarly, there is no clarity on whether businesses would be required to pay “reasonable compensation” to their managers, income that could be taxed at a higher rate, experts said. including that could help trump appeal to his base and mollify critics who say the plan is a giveaway for millionaires. “who needs to worry about carried interest going away if you have a 15 percent pass through tax rate,” said hedge fund manager jim chanos, who runs kynikos associates. “this should really be called the ‘put rich guys back on top tax act of 2017.’” tax reform has been a signature goal for trump since the campaign and his closest aides, including former goldman sachs (gs.n) president gary cohn who now directs the national economic council, are pushing to get it done this year. but in the wake of other stalled initiatives, plenty on wall street expect the plan to hit some roadblocks.  “so the first draft   prepared quickly just like his failed travel ban and healthcare proposal before the 100 days runs out   will be push backed and maybe dramatically changed by the democrats and members of his own party,” said douglas kass, who runs hedge fund seabreeze partners management.

" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on wednesday his government s future was at risk if it lost a sydney by election this weekend and failed to regain its one seat majority, forcing it to rely on independents to survive in power. turnbull s conservative voter base in the harbourside seat of bennelong, usually a safe blue ribbon seat, has collapsed, according to an opinion poll on tuesday. the newspoll in the australian newspaper said turnbull s liberal national coalition and the opposition labor each have a 50 percent chance of winning on a two party preferred vote, with liberal voters deserting to a newly formed conservative party.  it is a tight race. it is very high cost. if labor were to win in bennelong, then (labor leader) bill shorten would be very close to becoming prime minister,  turnbull told reporters in sydney. if turnbull loses bennelong, it would only take the loss of support from key independents in a vote of no confidence to see his minority government topple. centre left labor has not held power since 2013. turnbull has led a minority government since october after his deputy prime minister was forced to quit parliament for holding dual citizenship. under australia s constitution, national politicians can only have australian citizenship. the deputy prime minister was re elected on dec. 2 after renouncing his new zealand citizenship, but turnbull failed to regain his one seat majority because bennelong s liberal incumbent, former tennis champion john alexander, quit parliament because he believed he might hold dual australian british citizenship. turnbull s future now rests on the voters of the affluent bennelong electorate, where 13 percent of electors were born in either china or hong kong. but a strain in relations between australia and china in the past week may cost turnbull votes. turnbull announced last week a ban on foreign political donations aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics. he singled out china in announcing the ban, prompting a rebuke in china s people s daily newspaper.  australia must recognise china is now leading the world. the government s attitude towards china will cost them votes, said cao gui dong, a candidate for the christian democrat party in bennelong. a loss in bennelong would also see turnbull s grip on the prime ministership again come under scrutiny, with one liberal politician already calling for him to quit before christmas. turnbull has fought off leadership speculation for most of 2017, amid a slump in polls as voters flock to far right parties, but has vowed to lead his government to the next election due in 2019.

" israeli leaders welcomed the u.s. airstrikes in syria, saying they sent a strong message that the trump administration would not accept the use of chemical weapons and was a warning to other hostile states, including iran and north korea. prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel stood fully behind the decision to fire more than 50 cruise missiles at the airfield from where washington said president bashar al assad’s forces launched a deadly chemical attack this week. “in both word and action, president trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated,” netanyahu said in a statement.  “israel ... hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the assad regime’s horrific actions will resonate not only in damascus, but in tehran, pyongyang and elsewhere.” during the six year conflict in syria, israel has largely stayed on the sidelines, carrying out only occasional airstrikes when it feels threatened, including by the movement of weapons to lebanese hezbollah militants on its frontier with syria. israeli officials said the united states had informed them about the airstrikes ahead of time, but it was not clear whether israel provided intelligence or any other form of input to the white house to support carrying out the attack. israeli defence minister avigdor lieberman called the u.s. move an “important, necessary and moral message”. “the american notification to the israeli military and defence establishment before the strike is additional proof of the strength of the deep ties,” he said.  yaakov amidror, israel’s former national security adviser, said the calibrated response by the united states had sent a message that washington was reengaged in the region and that russia did not have free rein in syria.  “the americans are telling the russians: ‘you are not alone any more, not in syria not in the middle east, and we are ready to take all the steps to be involved, and if you neutralise the u.n. security council, we will know how to act without its permission’,” he said on a conference call with reporters.  “yet again, military action is an option that will be used when the americans decide that it should be used and (tell hostile states): ‘watch your behaviour and your attitude towards american interests’.” asked about the risk of retaliation, he said: “the chances for an attack initiated by either syria or hezbollah is even less today than before because now it is understood that if they violate the interests of the united states of america ... this administration is ready to take action.” as for israel stepping up its actions in syria, amidror said it would only engage if either of its two red lines are crossed: if strategic weapons are passed to hezbollah units or if launch sites for attacks are set up in the golan heights, where israeli occupied territory borders syria. “we will stay on the sidelines because our strategic decision was not to take part in this war. if there is something specific that we can do militarily or from an intelligence point of view and so on, i’m sure that israel would be more than happy to contribute to such efforts.”        ",0
" south africa s president jacob zuma has filed an appeal against a court ruling that his appointment of a state prosecutor to decide whether to reinstate corruption charges against him was not valid, local media reported on thursday. the high court ruled last week that zuma s appointment of head prosecutor shaun abrahams should be set aside immediately and that deputy president cyril ramaphosa should appoint a new public prosecutor within 60 days. the ruling was among a series of judicial blows to his administration, which has been hit by a series of scandals. zuma filed papers saying that people exercise presidential powers at the same time, according to television station enca.  zuma s spokesman could not immediately comment. the national prosecuting authority (npa) has also said it will appeal the ruling. in october the supreme court of appeal upheld an earlier decision by a lower court that the nearly 800 corruption charges filed against zuma before he became president be reinstated.  it then fell to abrahams, appointed by zuma, to decide whether or not the npa would pursue a case against him. the charges against zuma relate to a 30 billion rand  ($2.22 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s and have amplified calls for zuma to step down before his term as president ends in 2019.

" forty house democrats, led by the party’s top member of the house of representatives financial services committee maxine waters, voiced opposition on friday to a u.s. labor department proposal to delay the start of a controversial retirement regulation. in a letter sent on the final day of the proposal’s roughly two week long comment period, the group said that a 60 day delay of the dol’s fiduciary rule would deprive workers and families from unbiased financial advice. set to take effect on april 10, the fiduciary rule requires retirement advisers to put the interests of clients ahead of their own.  some of wall street’s largest brokerages have already leveled the commissions charged on certain investment tools, in an effort to eliminate any unintended incentive for advisers to select one fund over another. other brokerages have begun to phase out commissions paying retirement accounts altogether. despite that preparation, which began in earnest last year, president donald trump asked the labor department in february to re examine the cost of implementing the rule. the labor department proposed the delay to give themselves time to conduct such an economic and legal analysis. “it is unacceptable that now—roughly a month before implementation of the final rule is scheduled to begin—the dol is carelessly proposing to delay it,” the democrats wrote in their letter, noting the regulation was the product of six years of research and negotiation. “workers and retirement savers deserve better and have waited long enough,” the group wrote.

"hillary took a jab at saudi arabia during her statement on the terror attack in orlando but now we find out that the saudis are major contributors to her campaign. it s the height of hypocrisy for clinton to make claims of saudi arabia while taking their millions. thank goodness for social media and all the resources we have to expose this corrupt and hypocritical hag grifter in what may be the pinnacle of hypocrisy, moments ago hillary clinton, while speaking live on national security and addressing the orlando shooting took some time from her constant bashing of the second amendment and calling for a ban on assault rifles, to say some less than kind words about saudi arabia whom it accused of supporting radical organizations. this is what she said:the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by isis and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the united states and europe. for starters, it is long past time for the saudis, the qataris and the kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. and they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism. we also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online. this is something that i spend a lot of time on at the state department.there is nothing wrong with that statement, as it is the whole truth   saudi arabia s involvement in supporting terrorism stretches from sept 11 all the way through to isis   however, where there is a big, and potentially law-breaking, problem is what jordan s official news agency, petra news agency, reported on sunday citing the saudi crown price, namely that saudi arabia is a major funder of hillary clinton s campaign to become the next president of the united states.as mee notes, the petra news agency published on sunday what it described as exclusive comments from saudi deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman which included a claim that riyadh has provided 20 percent of the total funding to the prospective democratic candidate s campaign.the report was later deleted and the news agency has not responded to requests for comment from middle east eye. however, the deletion took place too late, as the washington-based institute for gulf affairs managed to capture the report and has re-published the original arabic petra report, which quoted prince mohammed as having said saudi arabia had provided with  full enthusiasm  an undisclosed amount of money to clinton.read more and view report: zero hedge",1

" the top u.n. human rights official said on wednesday he was  appalled  that iraq had hanged 42 men on sunday, almost certainly without a fair trial, and that he feared more would follow. the executed prisoners had been convicted of terrorism charges ranging from killing members of the security forces to detonating car bombs.  i am appalled to learn of the execution of 42 prisoners in a single day,  u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said in a statement.  we are extremely concerned at reports that iraq may be planning to expedite the process of executing prisoners already sentenced to death, and that this could result in more large scale executions in the coming weeks.  zeid said it was  extremely doubtful  that strict due process and fair trial guarantees, including the men s rights to effective legal assistance and a full appeals process as well as to seek pardon or commutation of their sentence, had been met in every one of the 42 individual cases. the hangings came after sunni suicide attacks killed at least 60 people near the southern city of nassiriya, a shi ite area, on sept. 14, prompting shi ite demands for tougher judicial action. iraqi officials have said that about 1,200 of the estimated 6,000 prisoners held in nassiriya have been sentenced to death, the statement said. zeid said iraq s use of the death penalty raised  massive concerns  and he called on the government to establish an immediate moratorium on its use. members of terrorist groups who were proven to have committed serious crimes should be held fully accountable, he said.  however, iraq s use of anti terrorism legislation to impose the death penalty for a wide range of acts does not appear to meet the strict threshold of  most serious crimes .  no information about those hanged on sunday has been released, such as their names, places of residence, crimes, trials, or date of sentencing, the statement said. iraqi officials have said all their appeals processes had been exhausted, the statement said.

" donald trump is taking some of his potential vice presidential running mates out for a test drive this week, meeting in private and trotting them out in public as he seeks to make his choice before the republican national convention less than two weeks away.  republicans close to the campaign say trump and his team are considering announcing his running mate pick next week ahead of the convention, to be held july 18 21 in cleveland, to try to get maximum media buzz from the decision. as his aides vet the people on his short list, trump is getting an up close look at some of the candidates and talking about it publicly, dispensing with the usual tradition of keeping secret the process of choosing a running mate. trump, who is to be formally nominated at the convention as the republican candidate for the nov. 8 election, met privately on tuesday with one possible pick, u.s. senator bob corker of tennessee, at trump tower in new york. on tuesday night, the two appeared together at a trump rally in raleigh, north carolina. trump introduced corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, as “a great friend of mine, somebody respected by everybody.” then it was corker’s turn.  “i’ve figured out the reason why you love him so much,” the senator told the crowd. “the reason you love him so much is because he loves you. he loves you and he wants the best for you.”      on wednesday, trump is to be joined for an event in cincinnati by newt gingrich, a former speaker of the u.s. house of representatives who is another possible pick by trump for the no. 2 position. gingrich has been a close trump adviser and is well regarded at trump tower. on monday, trump met on monday with u.s. senator joni ernst of iowa, another candidate on his short list. others on trump’s running mate list include indiana governor mike pence, who trump met with on saturday, new jersey governor chris christie, oklahoma governor mary fallin and u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama. christie, a former trump rival for the republican nomination, and sessions are among trump’s earliest supporters in the party and closest advisers.

" the republican tax plan unveiled on thursday stirred anger at u.s. universities, which said its proposals to tax endowments of private institutions and repeal a deduction for student loan interest payments would hurt institutions and students. the bill in the republican led house of representatives would increase students’ cost of attending college by more than $65 billion between 2018 and 2027, according to an analysis by the american council on education (ace), the lead lobby group for higher education. the plan “would discourage participation in postsecondary education, make college more expensive for those who do enroll, and undermine the financial stability of public and private, two year and four year colleges and universities,” ace president ted mitchell said . house speaker paul ryan, the most powerful republican in congress, told a news conference the tax plan would allow the typical family of four to save around $1,182 a year, which could go toward college savings. the plan would establish a 1.4 percent tax on the earnings of large, private school endowments. it would also scrap a deduction for interest paid on student loans, which congressional analysts said would increase federal revenues by $47.5 billion over 10 years, if other smaller tuition related tax breaks also end. president donald trump and fellow republicans have locked horns with colleges and universities, which they say force liberal values on students. private college endowments total $350 billion, according to the national association of college and university business officers (nacubo). the tax would only apply to endowments with at least $100,000 in assets for each student enrolled. since most universities must balance their budgets, they may raise tuition or cut programs and financial aid in order to cover a new tax, said nacubo federal affairs director liz clark. princeton university uses earnings from its $22 billion endowment to provide aid to more than 60 percent of students  and pay for academic programs, facilities and research, said bob durkee, vice president and secretary at the new jersey school.  families with incomes below $160,000 pay no tuition, he said. those with incomes less than $56,000 also forgo paying room and board. ending the interest deduction would hurt people’s ability to afford an education, said justin draeger, president of the national association of student financial aid administrators.  “for us, it’s one thing to talk about whether these funds are the most effective use of government money to help people afford college,” he said. “but it’s another to use them as an offset in an unclear tax overhaul.”  ",0
" u.s. president donald trump’s order temporarily banning visitors from seven muslim majority countries shows that his administration does not understand its counterterrorism duties, chinese state media said on wednesday. trump’s jan. 27 order, which he says is necessary for national security, sought to bar entry by travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days, and by all refugees for 120 days, except for refugees from syria, who face an indefinite ban. the move, which sparked protests and chaos at u.s. and overseas airports, has been suspended by a federal judge in seattle and is now under intense scrutiny from a u.s. federal appeals court questioning whether it unfairly targeted people over their religion. china’s government has offered mild criticism of the ban, saying immigration policy was a sovereign right but “reasonable concerns” must be considered. but the official xinhua news agency said trump’s order “shows that his administration has no correct recognition of the responsibility it needs to shoulder in a global fight against terrorism”. “radical elements around the world could use the ban to further justify their ruthless causes, and to gain more recruits,” xinhua said in a commentary. “that is a grave threat not only to the safety and security of the united states, but that of others worldwide. “banned countries on the list, such as iraq, libya and syria, have been victimized by terrorism because previous u.s. governments and other western powers deliberately intervened for self interests,” it added. such commentaries from xinhua do not equate to government policy, but often reflect official thinking. the world’s most populous nation generally accepts few refugees. china offered permanent residence to 1,576 foreigners in 2016, the public security ministry has said, but such openings are largely reserved for experts and professionals. china, which says it faces a serious threat from terrorism, has often rebuked the united states and other western countries for what it considers their double standards on terrorism. nervous about being implicated in possible human rights abuses, western nations have been reluctant to cooperate in china’s campaign in its far western region of xinjiang, where  officials say islamist militants aim to set up a separate state. rights advocates say ethnic violence in the region in recent years is a response to repressive government policies affecting the largely muslim uighur people who call xinjiang home, though china denies rights abuses there.

" germany said on friday it had ordered a second vietnamese embassy official to leave the country, after the alleged kidnapping of a vietnamese businessman who had applied for asylum and was facing corruption allegations back home. germany last month accused vietnam s intelligence agency of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh, who is wanted in the southeast asian country on charges of financial mismanagement that caused losses of around $150 million. officials at vietnam s ministry of foreign affairs were not immediately available for comment on friday. vietnam last month denied the accusations and said thanh had returned home voluntarily.  we have also declared a second employee of the vietnamese embassy persona non grata,  a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said in a statement.   he now has four weeks to leave germany with his family.  the foreign ministry also said german officials had informed the vietnamese ambassador on thursday that germany was temporarily suspending the strategic relationship between the two countries. it added that vietnam had not complied with demands to make an apology and provide assurances such incidents that broke german and international laws would not happen again. federal prosecutors in august took over an investigation into the alleged kidnapping, citing new evidence that thanh and a companion were likely taken to the vietnamese embassy in berlin before going back to vietnam.  german media reported last month thanh had been taken from the tiergarten, a large forested park in central berlin, by armed men on july 23. foreign minister sigmar gabriel said in august he had been  taken out of germany using methods which we believe one sees in thriller films about the cold war . czech authorities have arrested and extradited to germany a vietnamese intelligence agent suspected of involvement. berlin and hanoi in 2011 signed a strategic partnership declaration seeking to strengthen economic, political and cultural ties. germany is vietnam s main trading partner in the european union.

" when mike sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing. he settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.   i think there is a coal comeback,  said the 33 year old son of a miner. despite broad consensus about coal s bleak future, a years long effort to diversify the economy of this hard hit region away from mining is stumbling, with obama era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under president donald trump s proposed 2018 budget. trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal obama era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.   i have a lot of faith in president trump,  sylvester said. but hundreds of coal fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. the appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the appalachian regional commission.  although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978. a white house official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers. what many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch 22: coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. the stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity. federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. they include west virginia and kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted. but in southern pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. in southern virginia s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.  part of our problem is we still have coal,  said robbie matesic, executive director of greene county s economic development department.   out of work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. they say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.  in pennsylvania, corsa coal opened a mine in somerset in june which will create about 70 jobs   one of the first mines to open here in years. and consol energy recently expanded its bailey mine complex in greene county.  but consol also announced in january that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. and it has commissioned a recruitment agency, gms mines and repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour   half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. the program sylvester signed up for was set up by gms. the new hiring in pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry s main business. some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of australia. officials for u.s. coal companies operating in the region, including consol and corsa, declined requests for comment.   the coal industry has stabilized, but it s not going to come back,  said blair zimmerman, a 40 year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for greene county, one of pennsylvania s oldest coal regions. we need to look at the future.  the pennsylvania department of labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal power program, an initiative of former president barack obama to help retrain workers in coal dependent areas. but the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use. in greene and washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said ami gatts, director of the washington greene county job training agency. in westmoreland and fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.  i can t even get them to show up for free food i set up in the office,  said dave serock, an ex miner who recruits in fayette county for southwest training services. programs administered by the appalachian regional commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region s economy, have had similar struggles. one $1.4 million arc project to teach laid off miners in greene county and in west virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said. greene county commissioner zimmerman said he d like to see a big company like amazon or toyota come to southwestern pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.  but he knows first the region needs a ready workforce. amazon spokeswoman ashley robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in western pennsylvania. toyota spokesman edward lewis said the company considers local workforce training an  important consideration  when deciding where to locate facilities.  sean moodie and his brother steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.    i am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,  said sean moodie. coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. like sylvester, the moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by consol s recruiter, gms. bob levo, who runs a gms training program, offered a measure of realism: the point of the training is to provide low cost and potentially short term labor to a struggling industry, he said.   that s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,  he said.  they rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.  clemmy allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the united mineworkers of america s career centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery. he s placing his hopes for the region s future on retraining. umwa s 64 acre campus in prosperity, pennsylvania   which once trained coal miners   will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.  unlike when i worked in the mines,  he said,  if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.  follow trump s impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at the trump effect   www.reuters.com/trump effect (refiles to remove repeated words  the company  in paragraph 26) ",0

" republican lawmakers are pressing forward with an investigation into the 2010 sale of a canadian uranium company, which owned 20 percent of u.s. uranium supplies, to a russian government firm, despite five congressional inquiries having found no evidence of wrongdoing. copies of letters by the heads of two u.s. house of representatives committees released on wednesday showed they were seeking documents and other material on the deal from the fbi, the treasury and state departments and the office of the director of national intelligence. the letters set a deadline of nov. 30. devin nunes, chairman of the house intelligence committee, and trey gowdy, chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee, opened investigations on oct. 24 into the agreement struck during the previous administration of president barack obama, a democrat. the committees “have questions ... about the review and approval” of the sale of uranium one   which owned 20 percent of u.s. uranium supplies   by the u.s. committee on foreign investment in the united states, or cfius, according to the letters. the committees also want to know if the fbi “had evidence that russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering,” the letters said. although hillary clinton was not mentioned by name, the letters reflect unsubstantiated allegations by u.s. president donald trump, republican lawmakers, and right wing media that the 2016 democratic nominee masterminded the approval of the sale in return for donations to the clinton foundation. five committees in the u.s. house and senate found no evidence that clinton was behind the cfius’ approval of the deal, according to congressional records. in twitter posts, trump has called for an investigation of the sale, and attorney general jeff sessions said on tuesday he is evaluating whether to appoint a special counsel.  democrats and other critics say the allegations are baseless, and that trump and his supporters are fanning them to distract attention from special counsel robert mueller’s probe into whether there was any collusion between the trump election campaign and russia. while clinton was secretary of state at the time of the sale, her department has only one of nine votes on cfius, which is chaired by the treasury department and approved the sale unanimously. in addition, the state department cfius seat was occupied not by her, but by jose fernandez, then assistant secretary for economic, energy, and business affairs, who has said clinton played no role in the decision. the sale also was approved by the nuclear regulatory commission and obama. in a related development, representative elijah cummings, the top oversight committee democrat, objected on wednesday to the republicans’ refusal to give democrats access to an unidentified fbi informant whom republican lawmakers say has new evidence in the case.  in a letter to gowdy, cummings said republican lawmaker ron desantis told fox news on oct. 22 that he thought the informant could link the approval of the uranium one sale to “millions of dollars” that “sources connected to uranium one” donated to the clinton foundation.

" an order by president donald trump that could scale back enforcement of some obamacare provisions is unlikely to sink health insurance stocks, but shares of hospitals and medicaid providers could be under pressure over fears more poor people would lose coverage, analysts said. president trump signed an executive order on friday urging government departments to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions of the affordable care act, known as obamacare, that imposed fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. while the order lacked details, it signaled the start of an effort by trump and republicans to repeal and replace the program, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people. obamacare has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers, including unitedhealth group inc and aetna inc, largely pulling out of the system. shares of unitedhealth and aetna were little changed in early trading on monday. the equity markets dislike uncertainty and trump’s executive order introduces at least a modest level of new uncertainty, j.p. morgan analyst gary taylor wrote in a note on monday. the new administration may no longer enforce an affordable care act rule requiring individual americans to pay a penalty for not carrying health insurance, kellyanne conway, counselor to the president, said on abc’s “this week” program on sunday. the healthcare exchange system that is the cornerstone of the affordable care act depends on premiums from healthy, younger individuals, typically between ages 18 to 34, to offset higher expenses for covering older, less healthy individuals. the scrapping of enforcement was “a real risk” for 2017 insurance exchanges enrollment, sheryl r. skolnick, a healthcare analyst for mizuho securities usa inc, said in a research note on saturday. “we have to wonder why the hospital companies and investors who have pushed the stocks back up to pre election levels would be so enthusiastic,” skolnick wrote. but young people did not buy health insurance at desired levels, even when penalties increased for not having the coverage, said ana gupte, a healthcare services analyst for leerink partners llc in new york. “fundamentally, i don’t think it’s going to make a difference,” if the so called ‘individual mandate,’ requiring individuals to buy coverage or pay a penalty, is scrapped, said gupte. some experts also question whether the obama administration itself was vigilant about enforcing the rule. “we’re not sure as to how vigorously it was being enforced anyway,” said les funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for e squared capital management. still, trump’s plans could pressure shares of insurers such as molina healthcare inc, centene corp and wellcare health plans inc, who administer state medicaid plans, over concerns that the number of insured, especially among the poorest, would shrink.    molina’s shares were down 0.7 percent, while centene’s shares were down 0.5 percent. if medicaid funding becomes less than what states are receiving now, “it will put pressure on the number of people who are covered through medicaid expansion,” gupte said.   hospitals may also be on the hook for more unpaid medical expenses as the number of uninsured individuals increase and seek emergency room treatment, gupte added.  longer term, though, the hospital industry is lobbying to get more money for unpaid expenses and “it looks like they will get what they want,” gupte said. shares of hospital operators such as hca holdings inc, tenet healthcare corp and community health systems inc were down about 1 percent. “in reality, the executive order is just a sideshow to the main event – the repeal/replace legislation that republicans are expected to introduce this year,” taylor said.

" the bullet riddled body of a news photographer was found in central mexico on friday, state officials, putting 2017 on track to become the deadliest year yet for journalists in the notoriously violent country. edgar daniel esqueda, 23, who worked with metropoli san luis and vox populi slp in the state of san luis potosi, was found in the state capital with at least three bullet wounds in the back of his neck, authorities said.  the news outlets where esqueda worked reported had reported his abduction from his home by gunmen on thursday morning.  san luis potosi s governor, manuel carreras, told a press conference an investigation was underway. he did not say whether  esqueda s murder was linked to his work as a journalist.  with esqueda s killing, 2017 could become the bloodiest  year yet for reporters in mexico, according to press freedom and journalists  advocacy group articulo 19. the photo journalist was the 11th reporter killed so far this year, the group said. that matched the total in 2016, which was the highest number on record in a country torn by runaway levels of criminal and drug related bloodletting. over the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in mexico, 38 of them under the current government of president enrique pena nieto.  reporters without borders and the committee for the protection of journalists (cpj) both rank mexico among the deadliest countries in the world for reporters. activists have repeatedly criticized mexican prosecutors for failing to fully investigate many journalists  murders, allowing the killers to operate with impunity. mexico s human rights commission has asked state authorities to provide protection for esqueda s family members, who were at home with the photographer when he was taken by force, according to articulo 19. witnesses who spoke with the group said esqueda asked his kidnappers for their identity when they broke into the home where he was asleep with his wife, and they responded that they were police officers. the state police force said via twitter that  there has not been any police action against a reporter in the capital.   criminals, sometimes connected with state actors, know that they can get away with killing journalists in mexico because of  chronic impunity for these crimes. until that changes, the violence will continue,  alexandra ellerbeck, the cpj s program coordinator for north america, said in a statement. esqueda had reported threats months ago to a government run human rights group in san luis potosi, one of his colleagues told reuters.

" the international committee of the red cross said on thursday it had access to more than 1,300 foreign wives and children of suspected islamic state militants following concerns expressed for the safety of the families held by iraqi forces near mosul. the neutral aid agency called on all sides in the wars in iraq and syria to treat detainees in line with international law that prohibits torture or executions and enshrines the right to a fair trial. more than 300 of the detained foreign families in iraq came from turkey, many others from former soviet states, such as tajikistan, azerbaijan and russia, according to preliminary figures from the iraqi army.  currently we visit and provide humanitarian assistance to some 1,300 women and children of several dozen nationalities who are detained in iraq near mosul,  patrick hamilton, icrc deputy director for the middle east and north africa, told a news briefing. last month, foreign aid agencies in iraq said they were  gravely concerned  about the fate of the families. the women and children have been in iraqi custody since august 30 following the fall of the city of tal afar.  it is the largest group of foreigners linked to islamic state to be held by iraqi forces since they began driving the militants from mosul and other areas in northern iraq last year. the icrc denounced some authorities and militias in the iraq and syria wars against islamic state who have vowed to  annihiliate  the enemy, but declined to name names. such  dehumanisation  of the enemy could lead to unlawful torture or executions, hamilton warned.  talk of annihilation or extermination contributes to perpetuating the problem rather than solving it.  international humanitarian law protects civilians and former combatants, he said. the icrc has a  good level of dialogue  with iraqi authorities and has visited detention facilities in iraq holding 44,000 people so far this year, hamilton said. thousands of foreigners have been fighting for islamic state in iraq and syria and an unknown number of them are now detained. hamilton said the icrc was already in talks about potential repatriation of foreign fighters.  we are ready to play the role of a neutral intermediary to assist these states in carrying out that, the return of their individual citizens,  he said.  indeed we have been in dialogue with a number of different states and the iraqi authorities in relation to this over recent weeks, he said. hamilton, asked about media reports of executions by u.s. backed syrian democratic forces (sdf) following the fall of the jihadist capital in raqqa, syria, said that an icrc team had been in the  chaotic  northeastern city last week.  no, we frankly don t have first hand information in regards to extrajudicial killings or any such like ... clearly we remain concerned in the aftermath of raqqa as we do after mosul, hawija, tal afar and so forth,  he said.

" president donald trump’s administration is preparing an executive order that will require all u.s. food aid to be transported on american ships, according to four sources with knowledge of the deliberations. currently, 50 percent of such aid must be transported on u.s. flagged vessels. the sources said trump is considering going as far as doubling that to 100 percent, a move likely to stir opposition from both republicans and democrats. “an executive order is being drafted by the white house,” one source with knowledge of discussions told reuters, adding that it was being discussed among government lawyers. although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative touted as part of trump’s “america first” platform may slow food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said.  aid groups, and members of congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. the united states, the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. about half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. the conservative leaning american enterprise institute said in a november report that shipping food aid on u.s. flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer.     supporters say trump’s initiative would not only create new u.s. jobs in the shipping industry but that u.s. controlled food shipments are important for national security because the u.s. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. critics argue the order would create few, if any, jobs. food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military.   the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower cost international carriers, requiring more u.s. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people, they say. a spokesman for usaid, which oversees u.s. humanitarian programs, declined to comment, referring the question to the white house.  natalie strom, a spokeswoman for the white house said, “we don’t comment on any potential eo’s (executive orders) that may or may not be in the works.” trump has submitted a budget outline that proposed steep cuts in spending on foreign aid, which accounts for just 1 percent of all u.s. spending. members of congress from both parties said they opposed that plan. with the world facing four potential famines, and struggles to care for millions displaced by conflicts in syria, iraq and afghanistan, critics have been pushing to eliminate what they see as an unnecessary regulation that already adds $50 million a year to the cost of providing aid. tom hart, north america executive director at the one campaign, a non profit group co founded by u2’s bono to fight poverty, said the regulation would hinder getting life saving food assistance to the people americans are trying to help.     “millions of people could be denied the food aid they need to survive if the cargo preference requirement is doubled,” said hart. senator bob corker, the influential republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, has been an especially vocal critic of the shipping requirement. he and another committee member, democratic senator chris coons, have filed legislation to ease the requirement.  after hearing about the potential order, senators from both parties called senior administration officials to let them know this would not be supported in congress, a senate aide told reuters. “they’ve been warned,” the aide added.

" virginia governor terry mcauliffe on friday signed compromise gun legislation that recognizes concealed carry permits from all states while making it illegal for someone under a permanent protective order to possess a firearm. mcauliffe, a democrat, struck the deal with the republican controlled legislature last month. some lawmakers and gun rights groups had objected to attorney general keith herring’s decision in december to stop honoring concealed handgun permits from 25 states. “virginians elect their leaders to work together to get things done, and today i am proud to say we did just that,” mcauliffe said in a statement. mcauliffe, a former democratic national committee chairman, called the package the biggest step forward on gun safety in more than two decades. under the new laws, virginia must recognize concealed handgun permits from all other states, a rollback of herring’s stance. virginia can confiscate firearms from anyone who is under a permanent protective order for domestic violence offenses. the legislature had rejected such measures for years. virginia state police also will attend gun shows to provide voluntary background checks for private sellers. because of the compromise, mcauliffe has come under criticism from gun control advocates, including everytown for gun safety, the organization founded by former new york mayor michael bloomberg. everytown for gun safety had poured money last year into virginia, the home of the national rifle association gun lobby, in a failed bid to have democrats take control of the state senate. reacting to mcauliffe’s approval of the legislation, the coalition to stop gun violence praised the domestic abuse provision as a step in the right direction. but it said the concealed carry law would let virginians who are not eligible for a permit to circumvent it by getting a permit from another state and then carry a gun in virginia. “in addition to the public safety concerns, this new approach sends a terrible message that virginia is unwilling to enforce its own laws,” the group said.

" prosecutors said on thursday they had charged three senior  members of a swiss muslim group with making and promoting propaganda films for al qaeda. the indictment targeted three committee members of the islamic central council of switzerland (iccs), which describes itself as the country s largest islamic organization and says it focuses on representing the local population. iccs spokesman abdel azziz qaasim illi, who told reuters he was one of the three men charged, dismissed the case as a  political show trial,  and said authorities had misunderstood the video at the heart of the case. the indictment did not name the suspects, but the iccs said in a statement the other two were its chairman, nicolas blancho, and its cultural production head, naim cherni. the office of the attorney general said that the council had made films in syria in 2015 with a leading al qaeda member and posted two films on youtube that were promoted by the three committee members. the state prosecutor said it alleged  that the accused offered the leading al qaeda member in question a prominent multilingual multimedia platform from which to advantageously portray and promote both himself and the ideology of al qaeda.  qaasim illi called the indictments  clearly politically motivated  and said the interview had been with a senior saudi cleric who denied having links to al qaeda.  the point of the interview was to counter (islamic state) propaganda with a credible figure from the moderate syrian rebel spectrum. the interview itself never concerned al qaeda,  he added in an email.     the attorney general s office said the indictments were part of criminal proceedings first launched against the council in december 2015, after the posting of the videos. the case was launched as switzerland was in a heightened state of alert after attacks in paris that killed 130 people.  switzerland has not seen the kind of islamist attack that have rocked other western states, but authorities say they still see a significant threat. the attorney general s office said it was involved in around 60 criminal proceedings linked to jihadists, most of them related to  to propaganda in support of terrorist organizations .

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has the unenviable task of exploring u.s. russian cooperation following washington’s latest sanctions on russia and moscow’s expulsion of u.s. diplomats. tillerson and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov meet this weekend at a regional forum in manila, their first face to face talks since president donald trump reluctantly signed into law sanctions that russia said amounted to a full scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. the sanctions, which passed both houses of congress by overwhelming majorities despite trump’s objections, in part target the russian energy sector, with new limits on u.s. investment in russian companies. in retaliation, moscow has ordered washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff in russia and is seizing two u.s. diplomatic properties there. speaking to reporters on tuesday, tillerson held out hope for better ties. “there’s been no belligerence,” he said of his dealings with lavrov. “i think he is as committed as i am to trying to find ways that can bring this relationship back.” analysts and former u.s. officials were skeptical that much progress is likely any time soon on areas such as reducing the violence in syria’s civil war or calming the conflict in eastern ukraine, let alone reversing russia’s annexation of crimea. “the backdrop for that is obviously horrible given the russian anger over the sanctions bill and the continued day to day revelations in the russia probe,” said carnegie endowment analyst andrew weiss, referring to investigations into potential collusion between the trump campaign and russia during the 2016 u.s. presidential election. russia has denied seeking to sway the u.s. election and trump has denied any collusion. “the russians are probably in no mood to even allow us to show progress because if they (did) they would be saying you can go ahead and sanction us without consequences,” said a former u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “there is an incentive for them to have a lousy meeting.” tillerson and lavrov are likely to discuss the “de escalation zone” the nations agreed to establish in southwestern syria. russia and iran are the main outside backers of syrian president bashar al assad while washington supports some of the rebel groups seeking to topple him in a six year civil war. a second former senior u.s. official said he thought the best the two might achieve would be to prevent further deterioration. “do no harm is the other side of the coin,” said the former official who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he would expect the two men to review those areas such as the arctic, space and arms control where u.s. russian cooperation continues. one of the few areas where washington and moscow could make progress is on nuclear and conventional arms control, something they have achieved throughout their long history of tensions. tillerson and lavrov agreed in principle in april to resume so called strategic stability talks on disputes ranging from nuclear arms and missile defense to conventional military deployments in europe. the last formal talks were held in 2012. last month, the sides agreed to “exchange scheduling proposals in the near future” for that dialogue and for talks on extending new start, a 2010 accord that requires them to cut deployed strategic nuclear forces to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery systems by feb. 5 2018. it expires in 2021, but can be extended by five years if the u.s. and russian presidents agree.

" clinton s radicalized rhetoric has championed both bans on what she calls  weapons of war,  and the  australian model  of gun buybacks under the threat of government force.actual  weapons of war machine guns and selective-fire firearms have not been manufactured for the civilian market for 30 years, and cannot be, due to the hughes amendment to the firearm owners protection act of 1986 (fopa).yes, you heard that correctly. despite serial lies by democrats and the mainstream media, actual military rifles are not manufactured for the american market and haven t been on over a generation.what clinton actually wants to ban are the most common firearms sold in the united states. this includes common hunting rifles, target rifles, many popular handguns, standard rifle and pistol magazines, and if clinton follows massachusetts attorney general maura healey s deranged lead, could result in the majority of firearms designed in the past 100 years being banned.the threat of new federal gun laws is even more pronounced if gun owners unhappy with their choice of presidential candidates, opt to sit the 2016 elections out entirely, and democrats manage to gain seats in the house and senate, or even win majorities outright.in the 1990s and early 2000s, the brady campaign (former called the national council to control handguns and handgun control, inc.) used deep-pocketed gun control supporters to finance what was known as  lawfare. anti-gun attorneys would look for people to use as patsies to serve as plaintiffs in frivolous civil lawsuits against gun dealers, distributors, and manufacturers. the goal of these suits were always transparent, and always the same. these gun control supporters didn t really care if they won or lost their cases, or if their plaintiff patsies were ripped to emotional shreds; their goal was then (and remains now) to force gun dealers, distributors, and manufacturers to have to hire expensive attorneys and spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in legal fees to defend themselves in court.plcaa was passed into law specifically to keep a handful of gun control supporting billionaires from bankrupting the american gun industry from top to bottom with frivolous lawsuits. hillary clinton wants to repeal plcaa so that her allies, such as michael bloomberg, can then finance wave after wave of lawsuits to bankrupt gun companies with exorbitant legal fees.if clinton is successful in her goal of repealing plcaa which she could very conceivably do if she is elected in a  wave  that sees democrats pick up seats in the house and senate then no gun dealer or manufacturer, or sporting goods store, or ammunition company, would be immune to frivolous lawsuits, and all would be sued out of business.you would not be able to buy new guns, because there would be no manufacturers or importers after they were targeted, one-by-one.in many states where universal background checks are required, you would not be able to buy, sell, or trade existing guns, as dealer after dealer would be sued out of business.you would not be able to buy ammunition for your existing guns, as ammunition companies would also be targeted for extermination, as brady tried to do against lucky gunner as recently as last year (only to have their case struck down by a judge citing plcaa).this truly is an  all or nothing  election, folks.if you own any firearm of any kind, for any reason, or ever want to own a firearm for any reason, electing hillary clinton is simply non-viable.i know that there are republicans, democrats, third-party voters and political agnostics who aren t thrilled with their choices of presidential candidates this year. i m certainly not.i will tell you that if she is elected, hillary clinton will seek to destroy not just your right, but your ability to own, trade, and shoot the most common firearms in the united states.all of them, without exception.this includes your bolt-action deer rifle, your pump shotgun, your grandfather s heirloom revolver, the pistol you purchased for self defense, and the little .22 rifle you learned to shoot as a kid.consider yourself warned, and vote strategically to protect the constitution and the right to bear arms against the most dangerous and corrupt candidate to ever be nominated for president.  bearing arms",1
" the obama administration’s plan to set federal borrowing on a sustainable path relies on stronger economic growth than what is seen by other big government agencies, which in turn have been lowering their expectations. the administration’s view, laid out on tuesday in its annual budget proposal, is that gross domestic product will grow 2.3 percent each year over the long run.  the median policymaker at the federal reserve, however, sees long term growth at 2 percent, which is the same rate seen by the non partisan congressional budget office. the differences are modest but show white house economists are being slower to downgrade their view of america’s growth potential. while the fed and the cbo have been cutting their views on long term growth in recent years, the white house has held steady in each budget submitted since early 2013.  over the same period, the cbo has cut its view from 2.2 percent and the views of core fed policymakers have gone from a 2.3 2.5 percent range to a 1.8 2.2 percent range.      it is impossible to make a full apples to apples comparison between the administration’s view with those of the fed and cbo. the administration’s projections are based on the assumption its budget is fully enacted, which is unlikely to happen.  proposed immigration law changes would make the workforce younger and more productive while infrastructure investments would also boost efficiency, the administration said in the budget. prominent academics including former treasury secretary lawrence summers and northwestern university economist robert gordon have warned that u.s. growth may have shifted persistently lower in recent decades.  a stronger growth view allows the white house to project that the national debt will stay around 75 percent of gdp through 2026. the cbo by comparison sees debt on an upward path over the period, hitting 86 percent in 2026.  white house economists acknowledge slower growth would put pressure on the budget, saying in tuesday’s proposal that a 1 percentage point slowdown in gdp growth would add $3.1 trillion to the deficit in the decade through 2026. the budget also assumes a modest pace of health care inflation, easing strains on the budget created by an aging society, while arguing that proposed investments and immigration reform will help productivity growth. but the proposal notes that slower productivity growth and higher health care costs could result “in a debt explosion, with debt to gdp reaching over 500 percent by (around 2090).” ",0
" india will provide myanmar with $25 million for development projects including prefabricated houses in troubled rakhine state to enable the return of rohingya muslims who have fled the area, the foreign ministry said on thursday. more than 600,000 rohingya have escaped to bangladesh after attacks by insurgents on myanmar security forces in august triggered a military crackdown that the united nations has called ethnic cleansing.  the international community demands the rohingya be allowed to go home in safety, and bangladesh and myanmar have begun talks on repatriation, but huge doubts remain about the rohingya ever being able to return in peace to rebuild homes and till fields. india, which is concerned about the influx of the refugees into its territory, has stressed economic development of the rakhine region as a way to help lower tensions.  foreign secretary subrahmanyam jaishankar held talks with myanmar leaders on wednesday and signed a memorandum of understanding to support development of rakhine and help create jobs.   this is intended to help the government of myanmar achieve its objective of restoration of normalcy in rakhine state and enable the return of displaced persons,  the indian foreign ministry said in a statement.  under this mou, government of india proposes to take up, among others, a project to build prefabricated housing in rakhine state so as to meet the immediate needs of returning people.   india will spend $25 million over the next five years on development of the impoverished region, foreign ministry spokesman raveesh kumar said.  besides housing, the proposals include building schools, healthcare facilities and building bridges and roads.  india has been trying to promote economic cooperation with myanmar to try to push back against china s expansive involvement in infrastructure development across south asia.  beijing has also stepped into the rohingya crisis and proposed a three phase plan including a ceasefire, bilateral talks and then tackling poverty long term.

" president donald trump’s son in law and senior adviser jared kushner on monday gave details in a statement made public before his closed door meeting with the u.s. senate intelligence committee about his contacts with russians during the 2016 election campaign and the presidential transition period. the following are some of the main points in the statement:   kushner said he became a “point of contact” for foreign countries once it was clear that trump would be the republican presidential nominee. kushner said he had “incoming contacts” with people from roughly 15 countries. “to put these requests in context, i must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails,” he said.   kushner said he was introduced to russian ambassador sergey kislyak, among other foreign dignitaries, in april 2016  at a washington hotel where then candidate trump was making a speech. he said he shook hands with the dignitaries at the reception. “the ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election ... each exchange lasted less than a minute,” he said.   kushner said he attended a meeting, at the invitation of his brother in law donald trump jr., on june 9, 2016, at trump tower in new york. attendees included a russian lawyer discussing a ban on americans adopting russian children. kushner did not name the lawyer or others in attendance. “no part of the meeting i attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that i am aware of, i do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and i have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted,” he said.   after trump won the election, ambassador kislyak on nov. 16 invited kushner to a meeting, kushner said. he said that at the time, he could not recall the ambassador’s name. when he and kislyak met at trump tower on dec. 1, kushner said he asked kislyak to identify the best person to be a contact for direct discussions and a line to russian president vladimir putin.   kushner said he met on dec. 13 with sergey gorkov, a russian banker, for 20 25 minutes and received gifts of a piece of art and a bag of dirt, both from a village in belarus where kushner’s grandparents were from. he said he gave the gifts to his assistant to have them registered with the transition office. he said there was no discussion about russian sanctions. “at no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind,” he said.   kushner said his first security clearance form, which omitted foreign government contacts, was submitted in error by his assistant. he said he sent in a supplemental form the next day, disclosing he had numerous contacts with foreign officials, and provided a list of those contacts “in the normal course.” ",0

" thailand officially ended a year of mourning for its late king bhumibol adulyadej on monday, marking a return to colors for some after a monotone year during which many wore black from head to toe out of respect for their revered monarch. hundreds of thousands of people thronged bangkok s historic quarter to bid farewell last week to king bhumibol, who died in october 2016. his $90 million dollar funeral, full of pomp and ancient ritual, took place over five days. his remains were brought to their final resting place within bangkok s grand palace on sunday. portraits of the bespectacled late king, who became a father figure for many during a seven decade reign, were hung across thailand. the black and white funeral bunting that had hung on the gates of bangkok s government house for a year was taken down on monday and prime minister prayuth chan ocha made a televised announcement to mark the official end of the mourning period.  the government would like to thank officials, both soldiers and civilians ... and the more than 10 million thais who came to pay respects to the royal body over the past year,  prayuth said. may kanokwattana, 29, an office worker, wore bright yellow as she waited at the siam bts, a major bangkok transport interchange.  i wore black for one year. i needed to show my sorrow. today is the first day i am wearing a different color,  may told reuters. she also wore a pin with the thai number nine out of respect for king bhumibol, who was also known as the ninth king of the chakri dynasty. colors have a profound meaning for thais. astrological rules followed by many in the southeast asian nation assign a color to each day of the week. king bhumibol was born on a monday, a day associated with the color yellow. his only son, new king maha vajiralongkorn, was also born on a monday. some people shared charts on social media showing which colors would be considered luckiest to wear.  for confidence, health and power wear orange. for good support wear pale green,  said one chart. pattinya mankongwongcharoen, 49, an accountant wearing a peach colored dress, said:  i won t continue wearing black because the mourning period is officially over and to do so would be disrespectful.  others said they would continue to wear muted colors.  i m still grieving. i ll wear black or gray for a few more weeks,  said pimsuda chatree, 37, a shop owner.

" president donald trump s policy of  america first does not mean america alone,  vice president mike pence told the u.n. security council on wednesday as he urged reform to make peacekeeping missions more efficient, effective, accountable and credible. the 15 member council discussed how to improve peacekeeping operations during the annual gathering of world leaders at the united nations. there are currently 15 u.n. peacekeeping missions, costing more than $7.3 billion for the next year.  since january, trump s u.n. ambassador nikki haley has led a push to cut costs and is reviewing the mandate of each operation as annual mandates come up for renewal by the security council. trump wants to cap the u.s. share of the peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is  unfair.  the united states is a veto wielding member of the council, along with britain, france, russia and china.  peacekeeping missions must support a political solution; have the consent of the host country; its mandates must be realistic and achievable; every mission must have an exit strategy; and the united nations peacekeeping missions must adjust to progress and failure,  pence said.  in short, when a mission succeeds, we should not prolong it. when a mission underperforms, we should restructure it. and when a mission consistently fails to fulfill the mandates of this council, we should end it,  he said.  the security council unanimously adopted a resolution on wednesday pushing for improved accountability, transparency and effectiveness and to make peacekeepers more flexible. critics worry that harsh cuts could harm operations in volatile african states.  u.n. secretary general antonio guterres has pledged to make u.n. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.  across the years and across the globe, fifty five peacekeeping operations have successfully completed their mandate,  guterres told the council on wednesday.  many political missions have done the same.  he appealed for the security council to ensure mandates for missions were clear and that operations were well equipped.

" democrat hillary clinton’s campaign will take part in a recount of wisconsin votes in the u.s. presidential race, an effort republican winner donald trump called “ridiculous” on saturday. wisconsin’s election board on friday approved the recount requested by green party candidate jill stein. she has said she wants to guarantee the integrity of the u.s. voting system since computer hacking had marked the nov. 8 election. marc elias, the clinton campaign counsel, said the campaign would take part in the recount in wisconsin as well as in the other battleground states of pennsylvania and michigan if recounts were mounted there. elias said in a statement on the medium website that the clinton campaign had not planned to seek a recount since its own investigation had failed to turn up any sign of hacking of voting systems. “but now that a recount has been initiated in wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,” elias said.  clinton’s campaign should be legally represented in  wisconsin to be able to monitor the recount, he said.  in a statement, trump said the three states had been won by wide margins, including by more than 70,000 votes in pennsylvania. the recount is a “scam by the green party for an election that has already been conceded,” he said. the $7 million stein has sought to raise for the recounts is a way “to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,” he said.  although trump won the electoral college tally, clinton will have won the national popular vote by more than 2 million ballots when the final results are in. stein has raised $5.8 million of the $7 million needed to cover fees and legal costs for the three recounts, according to her campaign website. the deadline for filing a recount bid in pennsylvania is monday. the voting margins make it highly unlikely any recounts would end up giving clinton a win in all three states, which would be needed for the overall election result to change. trump beat clinton in pennsylvania by 70,010 votes, in michigan by 10,704 votes and in wisconsin by 27,257 votes. experts urged extra scrutiny of the three states, stein told cnn on friday, because their voting systems were seen as vulnerable.

" swedish prosecutors accused democratic republic of congo s government on wednesday of not cooperating with their investigation into the murder of a u.n. sanctions monitor from sweden. zaida catalan and her american colleague, michael sharp, were shot dead in march and found in a shallow grave in an area of central congo where they had been gathering information on a conflict between the army and a militia. congo s government has arrested more than a dozen people in connection with the killings, which it blames on the militia   though one report to the u.n. security council suggested state security services could also be involved. the swedish prosecution authority launched its own investigation into catalan s death, and said on wednesday it had received no response to a request it made in april for information from congolese authorities.  the swedish investigation is facing severe difficulties given the fact that it is completely reliant on evidence that exists in the congo and cooperation is not working with congo,  prosecutor sara nilsson said in the statement. material that swedish authorities had managed to collect  does not exclude that persons who have close ties to the regime in congo are involved in the murders,  the authority added. in april, congo s government screened a video to reporters, which it said showed members of the militia killing catalan and sharp. but analysts said the grainy footage raised more questions than it answered and nilsson told reuters the screening had tainted important evidence.  congo s government spokesman lambert mende has denied congolese officials were involved in the murders and said on wednesday that it was up to swedish authorities to provide information to the congolese court hearing the case, not the other way around.  justice is rendered here because the crime was committed here,  mende said.  if they have information that the court might not be able to access, they should give it to the court.  the conflict in kasai region between congo s army and the kamuina nsapu militia has killed as many as 5,000 people and displaced around 1.5 million more since august last year.  the united nations has repeatedly accused congolese forces of using excessive force and targeting civilians with alleged ties to the militia. the government denies those charges.

" rohingya muslims in bangladesh were skeptical on tuesday about their chances of ever going home to myanmar, even though the government there has given an assurance it would accept people verified as refugees. more than half a million rohingya have fled from a myanmar military crackdown in rakhine state launched in late august that has been denounced by the united nations as ethnic cleansing. myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying it is fighting rohingya terrorists who have claimed attacks on the security forces. the government has said anyone verified as a refugee will be allowed to return under a process set up with bangladesh in 1993. bangladesh and myanmar agreed on monday to work on a repatriation plan, and a myanmar government spokesman confirmed it would go along with it, provided people could verify their status with paperwork. but many refugees in camps in bangladesh are scornful.  everything was burned, even people were burned,  said a man who identified himself as abdullah, dismissing the chances that people would have documents to prove a right to stay in myanmar. at the root of the problem is the refusal by buddhist majority myanmar to grant citizenship to members of a muslim minority seen by a mostly unsympathetic, if not hostile, society as interlopers from bangladesh. though myanmar has not granted rohingya citizenship, under the 1993 procedure, it agreed to take back people who could prove they had been myanmar residents. but a day after bangladesh and myanmar announced apparent progress, a bangladeshi foreign ministry official appeared resigned to a difficult process.  this is still a long procedure,  said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media. there were already nearly 400,000 rohingya refugees in bangladesh before the latest exodus, but myanmar had said it would only accept,  subject to verification , those who arrived after october 2016, when a military offensive in response to rohingya insurgent attacks sent 87,000 rohingya fleeing to bangladesh, the bangladeshi official said.  we said that many rohingya refugees have no documents, so this process should be flexible. myanmar said they will decide who will get involved in the verification,  the official said, adding that bangladesh wanted international agencies to be involved. myanmar s government spokesman said under the 1993 pact, even a hospital record was enough to prove residency, but it was only myanmar, not bangladesh, that could verify  citizenship.  we have a policy for the repatriation process and we will go along with that,  the spokesman, zaw htay, told reuters. but even if refugees have documents, many are wary about returning without an assurance of full citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and curbs they have endured for years. amina katu, 60, laughed at the thought of returning.   if we go there, we ll just have to come back here,  she said.  if they give us our rights, we will go, but people did this before and they had to return.  last month, anwar begum told reuters she had fled from myanmar three times. the first time was to escape a 1978 crackdown, and she returned the following year. she fled again in 1991 and returned in 1994.  i don t want to go back,  the 55 year old added.  i don t believe the government. every time the government agrees we can go back, then we re there and they break their promise.  investigators appointed by government leader aung san suu kyi and led by former u.n. secretary general kofi annan recommended in august that myanmar review a 1982 law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most rohingya stateless. u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi told a meeting in geneva on monday that the link between statelessness and displacement was nowhere more evident than with the rohingya.  denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight,  he said. grandi called for a two track approach to tackle issues of citizenship and rights and inclusive development to stamp out poverty in rakhine state. separately, the u.n. refugee agency and bangladesh authorities are working to contain an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases in the camps, unhcr spokesman andrej mahecic told a briefing in geneva. refugees are still crossing into bangladesh, though at a slower rate, a spokesman for the international organisation for migration said. a reuters photographer saw smoke plumes on the myanmar side of the border but it was not clear what was alight. rights groups say more than half of more than 400 rohingya villages in the north of rakhine state have been torched. myanmar officials have said they have attempted to reassure groups of fleeing rohingya but they could not stop people who were not citizens from leaving.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin urged congress on wednesday to raise the federal debt limit before lawmakers start  their august recess, to avoid higher interest costs to taxpayers and market uncertainty about a potential default. maintaining u.s. creditworthiness is of the “utmost importance” and the united states must pay its bills on time, mnuchin told a senate appropriations subcommittee. “as i’ve suggested in the past, based upon our best estimate at the time, we do have funding through september, but i have urged congress to take this up before they leave for the recess,” mnuchin said. however there was little sign congress would heed mnuchin’s call, at least for the moment. the house of representatives is due to start its recess on friday with no hint of movement on the issue, while the senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill. that could leave the debt limit unaddressed until congress returns on sept. 5, perhaps one month before the treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations.   the last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in march with total debt of around $20 trillion, but the treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures, including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds. but short term treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid october, sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent 3 month bill auction. the situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty, said mnuchin, a former banker and hollywood film financier.  “right now effectively, as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates, we’re borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates, so there is a real cost to doing that,” he said. “there’s also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market. and the longer we wait, that more that uncertainty will be.” senator james lankford, a republican, said at the hearing that his best estimate, derived through working with treasury officials, was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about $2.5 billion, largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds. mnuchin did not dispute that estimate. lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on capitol hill this week as the senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, known as obamacare. “right now, my focus is obamacare,” said senator ted cruz when asked on tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern. cruz led fellow republicans in 2013 to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a 16 day partial government shutdown. another fiscal conservative senator, david perdue, said however he would prefer that congress stay in session in august to deal with raising the debt ceiling, adding: “we’ve just got to get it done.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down, a spokesman said.

" a u.s. congressional panel has warned of an “alarming” rise in china’s interference in hong kong, noting fears over the former british colony’s continued role as a global financial hub. in its annual report to congress on wednesday, the bipartisan u.s. china economic and security review commission highlights the “chilling” abduction and detention of five booksellers based in hong kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms. britain handed hong kong back to china in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide ranging autonomy remain intact. the commission, in a detailed 33 page section, urges a fresh probe from the state department into hong kong’s autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight. “hong kong’s traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the united states, as u.s. trade and investment ties with hong kong are substantial,” the report notes. it says the booksellers’ detentions   including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside hong kong   broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in september’s legislative election. “this incident has threatened the maintenance of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and led some observers to question hong kong’s status as a leading global financial hub,” the report warns. “the election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in hong kong.” u.s. senators marco rubio and tom cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze u.s. based assets and ban u.s. entry of those responsible for the “surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in hong kong”, according to a statement on rubio’s senate website. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said hong kong was an internal matter for china and no foreign country had the right to interfere. “in order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support,” geng told a daily news briefing. “those who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed.” the report comes amid deepening concerns in beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. the high court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted china when taking their oath of office, from the legislature. in a statement after the report’s release, the hong kong government said the “one country, two systems” principle was being implemented successfully, as was the city’s role as a global commercial hub. it also urged foreign parties not to interfere. the booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland china but freely available in hong kong. their plight fueled western governments’ concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests. one of the five men, swedish passport holder gui minhai, who disappeared from the thai resort of pattaya last october, is the only one still in detention in china. another, lam wing kee, returned to hong kong in june, saying he had been held captive by chinese agents for eight months.  the report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of china’s broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the south china sea and taiwan.

" the head of the united nations nuclear watchdog will visit iran on sunday for talks with senior officials there, as opposition from the united states threatens to undermine an international accord to curtail iran s nuclear program. yukiya amano, the director general of the international atomic energy agency, will discuss iran s implementation of the 2015 agreement, the iaea said on wednesday. the visit comes during a dispute between washington and tehran over u.s. president donald trump s decision this month not to certify iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between iran and six world powers. the u.s. congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re impose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the deal, in exchange for restrictions on iran s nuclear activities. amano, whose agency is in charge of policing those restrictions, has defended the agreement as a  net gain  for nuclear verification and said iran s commitments under the deal are being implemented. the iaea did not mention trump s refusal to certify iran was complying with the agreement. european union leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to the accord, hoping that congress will prevent the deal from collapsing. iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will  shred  the deal if washington pulls out, as trump has threatened to do.

" myanmar s vice president told the united nations on wednesday that security forces in his country s rakhine state, from which hundreds of thousands of people have recently fled, have been instructed to take  full measures  to avoid collateral damage and harming innocent civilians. violence in rakhine state erupted on aug. 25, when rohingya militants launched deadly attacks on government outposts, provoking a fierce crackdown by the myanmar military that has been greeted with widespread international condemnation, including at the annual u.n. general assembly this week. addressing the assembly, vice president henry van thio said it was not only rohingya muslims who had fled, but members of other minority groups too. he said human rights violations would be dealt with  in accordance with strict norms of justice.  at least 420,000 rohingya muslims have since fled into neighboring bangladesh to escape what a senior united nations official has called a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing . on wednesday, u.s. vice president mike pence accused the myanmar military of responding to militant attacks  with terrible savagery, burning villages, driving the rohingya from their homes.  pence called the crisis a threat to the world and said u.s. president donald trump wanted the u.n. security council to take  strong and swift action  to the violence.  van thio said his government was  deeply concerned about the present situation in rakhine  and said:  the security forces have been instructed to adhere strictly to the code of conduct in carrying out security operations, to exercise all due restraint, and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians.  he said the government s  deepest sympathy goes to the families of all innocent civilians and members of the police and security forces who have lost their lives.  van thio said the government was concerned by reports that  muslims were continuing to cross into bangladesh even though there had been no armed clashes since sept. 5 and added:  we would need to find out the reason for this exodus.  van thio said the government recognized the need to ensure humanitarian assistance was provided  to all those in need without discrimination.  he said a committee had been established under the social welfare minister to implement recommendations of an advisory commission chaired by former u.n. secretary general kofi annan and the government would establish an advisory board comprised of  eminent persons  from myanmar and abroad. myanmar was also working hard to enhance relations with bangladesh and would welcome a visit by its home minister to discuss cooperation on border security, van thio said.

" democratic u.s. senators tried to force a vote on a bill to rescind president donald trump’s order banning travel from seven muslim majority nations on monday, but were blocked by a republican lawmaker. democratic senator dianne feinstein said she had 27 co sponsors of a bill to rescind the order trump signed on friday, but under senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote. republican senator tom cotton blocked consideration of the measure. it would have faced a difficult fight for passage in the senate, where trump’s fellow republicans hold a 52 48 seat majority. trump’s directive on friday put a 120 day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from syria and a 90 day bar on citizens from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen.  the president argues that his action will protect americans, but critics say it illegally singles out muslims, violating u.s. law, and defiles america’s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. more than 160 democrats in the u.s. house of representatives introduced legislation in that chamber to defund and rescind trump’s order. but that measure is unlikely to advance in the house, where republicans hold a 240 193 seat advantage, larger than their advantage in the senate.

" democrats are striking back at the u.s. congress and white house over their push to cut regulations, as republicans ratchet up attacks on rules they say hurt business and give bureaucrats too much power. new jersey senator cory booker, a democrat, on tuesday introduced legislation to kill the congressional review act (cra), a law republicans used over the span of three months this year to repeal 14 regulations enacted by former president barack obama, also a democrat. booker, one of his party’s liberal stars, says that rate shows the cra is prone to abuse, and the law helps special interests sabotage thoroughly vetted rules they do not like. booker’s bill, co sponsored by fellow democrat senator tom udall of new mexico, would give future administrations the ability to resurrect the 14 annulled regulations on broadband, contraception, guns, the environment, education and other areas.  the cra bans agencies from issuing new versions of repealed rules in the future. booker’s bill would also lift that ban. rhode island representative david cicilline and michigan representative john conyers, both democrats, introduced a companion bill in the house on tuesday. senator patty murray, the senior democrat of the committee overseeing labor and pensions, also is attempting to work around the prohibition through bills to make two of the eliminated regulations, on retirement savings and workplace safety, the law of the land. she has introduced a bill to help states and cities provide retirement accounts to private sector workers and has co sponsored another on employers’ records of injuries and deaths.  if any of the democrats’ bills survive the senate, they would likely die in the house, where republicans hold an ample majority. after sweeping congress and the white house in november’s elections, republicans established a beachhead in their battle against regulation through the cra.  they are now in the next phase: limiting new rule makings. later this week a senate committee will put finishing touches on the regulatory accountability act and send it to the full chamber. supporters say the bill, already passed in the house, makes regulators more answerable to lawmakers and more responsible for analyzing rules’ costs. critics say it establishes so many requirements that it will paralyze regulation in important areas such as education. republicans are also considering keeping the cra in play.  senator pat toomey of pennsylvania has asked congressional auditors to determine if the law can be applied to agencies’ guidance that effectively resembles regulation. others are weighing killing two forthcoming rules from the consumer financial protection bureau, headed by democrat richard cordray, an obama holdover.

" president donald trump is expected to sign an executive order on cyber security on tuesday, two sources familiar with the situation said, marking the first action to address what he has called a top priority of his administration. the order is expected to commission several different reviews of the government’s offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, according to one of the sources and a third briefed on a draft of the order that circulated last week. the move follows a presidential campaign that was dominated by running storylines related to cyber security, including the hacking and subsequent leaking of democratic emails as part of what u.s. intelligence agencies determined was a wide ranging influence operation intended to help trump win the white house and denigrate his challenger, democrat hillary clinton. for months trump refused to accept the conclusions of the agencies that russia was responsible, before stating at a press conference on january 11 that, “as far as hacking i think it was russia.” in his answer, trump, then the president elect, pivoted to say that “we also get hacked by other countries, and other people” while vowing to launch a government wide review of vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. the order is expected to also initiate a audit of several federal agencies’ cyber capabilities, seek input on how to improve protections for critical infrastructure, and review government efforts to attract and train a technically sophisticated workforce, according to two of the sources briefed on the draft, which was first published by the washington post. the draft order would also seek ways to give the private sector incentives to adopt strong security measures.

" on a rooftop overlooking the walls of jerusalem’s old city, around 200 american israeli fans of donald trump gathered to proclaim their support for the republican candidate, convinced he will be israel’s best friend if elected. wearing “make america great again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in trump t shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti semitism of some of his supporters. “trump will let israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what i like,” david weissman, a 35 year old from queens, new york, who moved to israel three years ago, said at the event late on wednesday. “he’s not a saint, but look at his achievements. he’s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical islam, and he’s not going to support the two state solution,” he said, referring to long standing efforts to forge peace with the palestinians. trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. others at the rally said they liked the fact that trump was promising to move the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, officially recognizing jerusalem as israel’s capital, and would not berate israel for building jewish settlements in occupied territory. “it’s very important that he becomes president,” said connie gordner, 82, who moved to israel from jacksonville, florida, 21 years ago. “if hillary clinton becomes president, we’re dead.” the rally was organized by republicans overseas israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 u.s. citizens living in israel or in jewish settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem, which the palestinians seek for their own state. even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come nov. 8. marc zell, co chairman of the non profit group, believes around three quarters of american israelis support the republican party and its candidate. in an impassioned speech to the small crowd, david friedman, trump’s adviser on israel, heaped criticism on democratic candidate hillary clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said trump was israel’s greatest hope. “under trump, the united states will never pressure israel into accepting a two state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the israeli people,” he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of “crooked hillary”. while the motley crowd was unabashed in its trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most jewish israelis favor clinton over trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. the critical element is american israelis who retain the right to vote in u.s. elections. some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national religious outlook. trump’s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. on wednesday, he delivered a minute long video to the rally, playing up his connections to judaism through his daughter’s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. “my administration will stand side by side with the jewish people and israel’s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only jewish americans and israelis but also all americans and israelis,” he said. “together we will make america and israel safe again.” ",0
" the top u.n. human rights official welcomed president barack obama’s plan announced on tuesday to close the u.s. military prison at guantanamo bay, but stressed that no detainee should remain in indefinite custody without charge or trial. zeid ra’ad al hussein, u.n. high commissioner for human rights, said the u.s. facility in cuba had been a “serious blot on the human rights record, and reputation, of the united states for the past 14 years”. “all guantanamo detainees should either be transferred to regular detention centers in the u.s. mainland or other countries where fair trials before civilian courts and due process guarantees can be provided in accordance with international norms and standards,” he said in a statement. “if there is insufficient evidence to charge them with any crime, they must be released to their home country, or to a third country if they risk persecution at home.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump asked then fbi director james comey to end the agency’s investigation into ties between former white house national security adviser michael flynn and russia, according to a source who has seen a memo written by comey. the explosive new development on tuesday followed a week of tumult at the white house after trump fired comey and then discussed sensitive national security information about islamic state with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov. the comey memo, first reported by the new york times, caused alarm on capitol hill and raised questions about whether trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. the white house quickly denied the report, saying in a statement it was “not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and mr. comey.” comey wrote the memo after he met in the oval office with trump, the day after the republican president fired flynn on feb. 14 for misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations last year with russia’s ambassador, sergei kislyak. “i hope you can let this go,” trump told comey, according to a source familiar with the contents of the memo.  the new york times said that during the oval office meeting, trump condemned a series of government leaks to the news media and said the fbi director should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information. coming the day after charges that trump disclosed sensitive information to the russians last week, the new disclosure further rattled members of congress. “the memo is powerful evidence of obstruction of justice and certainly merits immediate and prompt investigation by an independent special prosecutor,” said democratic u.s. senator richard blumenthal. republican and democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the memo. republican u.s. representative jason chaffetz, chairman of a house of representatives oversight committee, said his committee “is going to get the comey memo, if it exists. i need to see it sooner rather than later. i have my subpoena pen ready.” in a letter to acting fbi director andrew mccabe, chaffetz set a deadline of may 24 for the fbi to produce “all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between comey and the president.” republican speaker of the house paul ryan backed chaffetz. “we need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the house oversight committee to request this memo,” said ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong. legal experts took a dim view of trump’s comments, as quoted in the memo. “for the president to tell the fbi to end a potential criminal investigation, that’s obstruction of justice,” said erwin chereminsky, a constitutional law professor and dean of university of california, irvine school of law. “this is what caused president nixon to resign from office.” but the experts said intent was a critical element of an obstruction of justice charge, and the president’s words could be subject to interpretation and possibly put into the context of other actions, like comey’s termination. the fact that the president apparently said he “hoped” comey would end the flynn investigation rather than more directly ordering it “makes for a weaker but still viable case,” said christopher slobogin, a criminal law professor at vanderbilt university law school. flynn’s resignation came hours after it was reported that the justice department had warned the white house weeks earlier that flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with kislyak before trump took office on jan. 20. kislyak was with lavrov at the white house when trump disclosed the sensitive information. a spokeswoman for the fbi declined to comment on the details of the memo. an emailed fundraising appeal by trump’s political organization and the republican national committee sent out after reports of the comey memo said trump was being victimized by an “unelected bureaucracy.” “you already knew the media was out to get us,” it said. “but sadly it’s not just the fake news… there are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage president trump and our entire ‘america first’ movement.” the new development came as republican and democratic lawmakers pressured trump to give a fuller explanation for why he revealed sensitive intelligence information to lavrov. the information had been supplied by a u.s. ally in the fight against the islamic state militant group, the officials said.

" democratic senator bob menendez of new jersey has asked a federal judge to throw out his indictment for corruption, citing a u.s. supreme court ruling narrowing the definition of conduct that can lead to such prosecutions. lawyers for the senator in a court filing on tuesday pointed to the june 2016 supreme court decision that overturned the corruption conviction of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell. the court found that political activities such as arranging meetings or making calls to officials do not qualify as “official acts” as defined by bribery statutes. the high court’s decision prompted the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals last week to vacate the conviction of sheldon silver, the former speaker of the new york state assembly and one of the state’s most powerful politicians for decades. u.s. prosecutors have said they will retry him. other convicted politicians, including former new york state senate majority leader dean skelos, have also relied on the mcdonnell decision in mounting post trial appeals. menendez, who will seek a third six year term in 2018 despite the indictment, is accused of accepting campaign donations, luxury travel and gifts from a wealthy friend, florida ophthalmologist salomon melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on the doctor’s behalf. melgen was convicted in april of an unrelated medicare scheme in florida that authorities said robbed the health care program of as much as $105 million. he and menendez have pleaded not guilty in new jersey. menendez lost a previous bid to dismiss the charges, but his argument in that challenge came before the supreme court decision on the mcdonnell case. menendez’s lawyers argued on tuesday that the allegations against the senator must be dismissed in light of the supreme court’s ruling. “placing calls and having meetings to discuss these issues, even if to encourage others to take a particular action –something any citizen can do – are not ‘official acts’ by senator menendez under mcdonnell,” they wrote. the u.s. department of justice did not immediately comment on the motion on wednesday.

" president donald trump nominated former republican lawmaker scott garrett as president of the export import bank of the united states on friday, completing an about face over an institution he had denounced as “featherbedding” for big business. a white house statement also named spencer bachus, another republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. both were named for four year terms. trump told the wall street journal on wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank’s five member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. his picks must gain approval from the senate, which blocked nominees by former president barack obama. the export import bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase american made goods. for example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from boeing co (ba.n) and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. the bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create american jobs. trump’s backing of the bank represents a victory for  manufacturers like boeing and general electric co (ge.n), which have overseas customers that use the agency’s government backed loans to purchase their products. trump told the journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being “featherbedding” for wealthy corporations. trump’s about face followed a meeting on tuesday with former boeing chief executive jim mcnerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation’s aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. large american corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. a 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in congress allowed the bank’s charter to expire for five months. after overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank’s charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines.

" venezuela s pro government legislative superbody ruled on wednesday that parties who boycotted this month s local elections had lost legitimacy, potentially eliminating the main opposition groups from the 2018 presidential race. the decree by the constituent assembly   created in a controversial july vote boycotted by the opposition and widely condemned abroad   infuriated venezuela s opposition and drew criticism from the united states.   the venezuelan government and its illegitimate constituent assembly are inventing rules as they go along. this is not democracy,  the u.s. embassy said on twitter. the justice first, democratic action and popular will parties did not run candidates in this month s mayoral polls in protest against what they said was a biased election system designed to perpetuate leftist president nicolas maduro s  dictatorship.  maduro had warned that could cost them participation in future votes and the constituent assembly echoed that position on wednesday, saying the parties had lost their legal status and should re apply to the national election board. given that the board is pro maduro and authorities are constantly throwing up obstacles to the opposition, that could well mean those parties are now effectively unable to run in the presidential election due before the end of 2018. maduro, 55, is expected to run for re election despite the disastrous state of the economy in venezuela, where millions are skipping meals and struggling to survive amid one of the world s highest inflation rates and widespread shortages of basics. two of his potentially biggest rivals already cannot run against him: popular will leader leopoldo lopez is under house arrest, while justice first leader henrique capriles is prohibited from holding political office.  we alert the world and all democratic governments that banning opposition political parties is yet another measure by the dictatorship that deserves rejection and condemnation,  said capriles  party colleague tomas guanipa. maduro and his allies say the constituent assembly has brought peace to the opec nation after months of opposition protests earlier this year in which more than 125 people were killed. demonstrators said they were fighting for freedom, but the government condemned them as violent subversives.   it s time for the coupsters to face the constitution. let no one undermine the people s participation and the democratic system,  constituent assembly head delcy rodriguez said after the passage of wednesday s measure.

" three german parties resigned themselves to further talks next week to try to form a new coalition after making little progress on thursday in bridging deep divisions on immigration and climate policy. chancellor angela merkel is trying to unite her divided conservative alliance, which suffered bruising losses in a national election last month, in a pact with two other parties that is untested at federal level. after 11 hours of talks on thursday, negotiators said they had failed to find much common ground on the difficult topics of climate change and immigration, but would take the weekend to consider the arguments of the other parties.  we hope to take further steps in the course of next week,  nicola beer, general secretary of the pro business free democrats (fdp), told journalists. immigration was the most divisive topic, with many conservatives keen to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on merkel s decision to open germany to more than a million mainly middle eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016. an agreement reached between merkel s christian democrats (cdu) and their bavarian csu sister party to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, andreas scheuer, csu general secretary, said after thursday s talks.  that is really going to be the crunch point,  he said, adding that the issue was the reason for the gains of the anti immigration alternative for germany (afd) party in the election. party leaders would meet to seek a solution on refugee policy by next thursday, sources close to the talks said.  the environmental greens, who oppose a refugee cap, said positions were far apart on immigration:  the debate on this topic was calm and constructive but the differences remain serious,  said greens negotiator michael kellner. the parties did agree to stick to climate goals that envisage cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020, but were still divided on how to achieve that, sources familiar with negotiations said. kellner reiterated the greens  position that germany should quickly close coal fired power stations to help fight climate change, a position resisted by the other parties.  we are the first generation to experience climate change and we are the last generation who can stop it,  he said.  the parties made limited progress on european policy, agreeing a broad brush statement that said that  germany can only do well if europe does well  while listing 25 open points for further debate. politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving germany hobbled as the european union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform. in a nod to ambitious european reform plans laid out by french president emmanuel macron, the statement said franco german cooperation was  of paramount importance to us.  the parties  negotiators agreed to further discuss eu reform issues including a euro zone budget   an idea pushed by macron   and the future of the euro zone s rescue mechanism, the esm. sources close to negotiations said there was a consensus against a euro zone budget, but the parties did not want to immediately reject macron s proposal. the statement stressed that talks with britain on leaving the eu must respect the interlinkage of the bloc s principles of free movement of capital, citizens, goods and services, which could suggest that berlin wants to take a hard line with london. kellner said the parties were far apart on the esm, which some conservatives want to see play a stronger role in preventing economic crises in the euro zone.

" a spokesman for russia s defence ministry said on wednesday that a series of attacks launched by islamic state in syria on government forces had come from an area near the border with jordan where a u.s. military mission was located. the spokesman, major general igor konashenkov, said in a statement the attackers had the precise coordinates of the syrian government forces, which could only have been obtained through aerial reconnaissance.  if the united states views such operations as unforeseen  coincidences,  then the russian air force in syria is prepared to begin the complete destruction of all such  coincidences  in the zones under their control,  he said.   the main obstacle to completing the defeat of islamic state in syria is not the military capability of the terrorists but the support for them, and flirtation with them, by the united states,  konashenkov said.

" corsican nationalists said on monday it was time for talks with paris on greater autonomy for the french mediterranean island, after they won nearly two thirds of seats in local elections. support for their cause in sunday s vote was boosted by dissatisfaction with france s mainstream parties, a trend that has fueled secessionist ambitions in other parts of europe. nationalist leader gilles simeoni hailed the start of a new era after the two party pe a corsica (for corsica) alliance that he heads took over 56 percent of sunday s vote and 41 of 63 seats.  unlike in catalonia, nationalists in corsica have downplayed any ambitions for secession, saying the island   where napoleon was born in 1769   lacked the spanish region s demographic and economic clout.  but simeoni said he was seeking a greater say for local authorities on fiscal issues, official status for the corsican language, and limiting the right to buy property in some areas to people who had lived on the island for at least five years.   this is a time many of us thought we would never witness,  he told applauding supporters after the win, referring to the fact that nationalists only started to make headway in corsican elections two years ago.  our dream is becoming reality.  calling for discussions to find a  political solution,  simeoni told reuters:  it s the start of a new era, the ball is in the government s court.  the nationalist vote also benefited from the island s most active clandestine group, the national front for the liberation of corsica (flnc), having laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four decade long rebellion. turnout for the run off election, in which the top parties from an initial dec. 3 ballot participated, was barely above 50 percent. but in a sign that the government may be heeding the call for dialogue, prime minister edouard philippe on sunday called simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in paris, philippe s office said.     corsica has a population of just 320,000 people and a tiny 8.6 billion euro ($10.13 billion) economy. ($1 = 0.8488 euros) ",0
" fighting in eastern ukraine has escalated to the worst level in months, officials monitoring the conflict said on tuesday, after the shelling of a frontline village wounded eight civilians and destroyed or damaged dozens of homes. a russia backed insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire deal that was meant to end a conflict in which more than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near daily basis. the organisation for security and co operation in europe, which monitors the implementation of the peace agreement, said it had recorded 16,000 ceasefire violations between dec. 11 and dec. 17, a 35 percent increase on the week before.   we note with concern a sharp deterioration in the security situation with ceasefire violations reaching levels not recorded since february this year,  chief monitor ertugrul apakan said in a statement. in february, a surge of violence around the government held industrial town of avdiivka cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on the front line. apakan said the latest escalation reflected an established trend  in which a recommitment to the ceasefire by the sides was followed by a steady increase in the level of violence, culminating in fierce fighting .     apakan s comments followed warnings from aid agencies over the humanitarian situation in the eastern donbass region, particularly given monday s attack on the government controlled village of novoluhanske. the united nations  ocha humanitarian arm said on twitter heavy shelling near novoluhanske was affecting 2,000 residents. people are fleeing the area in blizzard conditions, it said. eight civilians were wounded and more than 50 buildings were damaged in the shelling, which also temporarily cut power supplies, the regional kiev controlled donetsk administration said. a reuters witness saw residents picking their way through the rubble of destroyed homes and surveying fire blackened buildings. the u.s. state department said the humanitarian situation was  dire  because of the shelling, which it blamed on russian led forces firing grad multiple launch rockets. the ukrainian military on tuesday accused pro russian separatists of deliberately firing more than 40 times from multiple launch rocket systems at novoluhanske.  meanwhile, the rebel command said attacks from the ukrainian side had almost doubled in the past 24 hours, according to separatist news website dan. rebels deny attacking novoluhanske and say the ukrainian military fired at the village to justify their attacks on separatist held civilian areas, according to dan. the u.s. state department also voiced concern about fighting around the donetsk water filtration station, which has a system of pipes that carry chlorine gas.  if those were to go off in this area, which is close to where people live, it could be potentially devastating,  state department spokeswoman heather nauert told a briefing. she said civilian water workers were trapped in the station s bomb shelter and could not get out because of fighting. in an effort to end the deadlock, the international community, including the united states, has in recent months been advocating for the deployment of u.n. peacekeepers in the donbass. both kiev and moscow backed the idea but disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel controlled part of the ukraine russia border, so no decision was made. russia denies accusations from ukraine and nato that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons.

" the head of the midwest region of the u.s. environmental protection agency offered her resignation over the water contamination crisis in flint, michigan, the agency said on thursday, as it issued an emergency order to resolve the growing problem.     susan hedman, the second official to resign since the crisis unfolded, had played down a memo by an epa employee that said tests had shown high levels of lead in the city’s water, telling flint and michigan administrators it was only a draft report. hedman’s resignation will take effect feb. 1, the epa said. before the agency’s announcement on hedman, the white house said president barack obama will ensure officials will be held accountable if any wrongdoing is found. the epa on thursday issued an emergency order requiring michigan and the city of flint to take immediate steps after determining that their response to the crisis had been “inadequate to protect human health.” under the direction of a state appointed emergency manager, flint, a working class mostly african american city of 100,000 north of detroit, switched water supplies to the flint river in 2014, to save money. the river is known locally as a dumping ground. the more corrosive river water, which was not treated, caused more lead to leach from the city’s aging water pipes than the detroit water the city had tapped previously.  complaints about the water began within a month of the change, but officials did not take steps to remedy the situation until october 2015 after tests showed elevated levels of lead in some tap water in the city and in some children. lead is a neurotoxin that can damage brains and cause other health problems.  the city switched back to detroit water in mid october, but the contamination continued. the flint crisis pushed epa administrator gina mccarthy on thursday to issue a new policy to elevate any issues that appear to be a substantial threat to public health, or that “other authorities appear to be unable to address.”  “our strength can become a weakness if we interpret our responsibility as ending with simple technical compliance,” mccarthy said in a memo to all epa staff. the epa’s inspector general agreed to evaluate the midwest office’s public water system supervision program and its implementation of its state oversight.  representative jason chaffetz, chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee, said “the epa is rife with incompetence and region 5 is no exception. mismanagement has plagued the region for far too long and ms. hedman’s resignation is way overdue.” white house spokesman josh earnest, noting that the justice department was investigating the contamination of flint’s water supply, told reporters that obama will make sure that epa officials are held responsible for any errors that may be uncovered. by the end of next week, michigan would have access to $80 million for water infrastructure funding agreed to in last month’s bipartisan budget, obama told a group of mayors at the white house.  michigan governor rick snyder and other officials will be called to testify next month to a congressional panel. u.s. representative brenda lawrence, a democrat, requested a feb. 3 hearing of the house oversight and government reform committee last week, said spokeswoman tracy manzer. the invitation will be specifically for the governor and he cannot send a representative on his behalf, manzer said. however, republicans on the committee said nothing about the hearing was set in stone and it was not yet on the committee’s website calendar. details being discussed about a hearing on flint “are entirely premature,” said a spokesman for republicans on the committee who did not want to be named. “there are no confirmed details at this time, particularly with respect to a date or witness invitations,” the spokesman said. dan wyant, former director of michigan’s department of environmental quality, are among the other invitees. wyant resigned in december over the growing crisis in flint. the hearing will “identify precisely what went wrong in the process and to ensure that those who were responsible are to be held accountable and that this never happens again,” manzer said. snyder, a republican, has rejected calls from critics for his resignation over the crisis. he asked the michigan state legislature this week to approve $28 million to assist flint and said there would be additional funding requests. the michigan house approved the funding unanimously on wednesday and the bill was in the senate on thursday. in recent weeks, the michigan department of health and human services also has said that it has seen an increase in legionnaires’ disease cases in the county that includes flint covering the period in which the river water was the primary source. it could not conclude if the cases were related to the water switch. a report released on thursday found 87 legionnaires’ cases in the county from june 2014 through october, including nine deaths.

" americans are more concerned than they were before the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign began about the potential threat russia poses to the country, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on friday. the jan. 9 12 survey found that 82 percent of american adults, including 84 percent of democrats and 82 percent of republicans, described russia as a general “threat” to the united states. that’s up from 76 percent in march 2015 when the same questions were asked. the increased concern comes after a brutal election season during which democrats and others raised questions about president elect donald trump’s financial ties to russia and the u.s. intelligence community accused russia of engaging in cyber attacks during the election.  trump, who has repeatedly praised russian president vladimir putin as a strong leader and signaled during his campaign that he might take a softer line in dealing with moscow, only recently accepted that russia committed the hacks after receiving detailed briefings from intelligence officials.  trump initially criticized the findings, saying the culprit could be china or “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”  the poll asked people to rate russia and a slew of other countries on a 5 point scale ranging from “no threat” to “imminent threat.” it found that americans were more likely to label russia a threat than they were iran, syria, china, saudi arabia, cuba or yemen. only north korea ranked higher, with 86 percent of americans labeling it as a threat. some 25 percent of americans gave russia the highest concern, labeling it an “imminent threat.”  “russia is back to the old days of the cold war,” said oneita wilkins, 69, a republican who lives in a suburb of new orleans, who rated russia an “imminent threat.”  wilkins did not vote in the election. she said she did not trust trump or democratic rival hillary clinton and chose to not vote for the first time in more than 40 years. the latest reports about russian hacking lowered her opinion of trump even further. “trump doesn’t have any experience with other countries,” wilkins said. “i have a feeling that he’ll be easily influenced by putin.” trump, earlier this week in his first news conference since the election, defended his goal of better ties with putin, saying, “if putin likes donald trump, i consider that an asset, not a liability.” the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english in all 50 states. it included 1,169 american adults, including 490 democrats and 475 republicans. the poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for republicans and democrats.

" u.s. defense secretary ash carter is scheduled to preview the pentagon’s fiscal 2017 budget request in a speech on feb. 2, a week before the white house sends its budget plans to congress, two u.s. defense officials said on monday. carter is expected to highlight the broad themes of the pentagon’s budget request and its priorities, rather than presenting a detailed list of programmatic changes, said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly. a massive government spending bill enacted by congress last year set a spending level of about $576 billion for the pentagon in fiscal 2017, which meant the defense department had to trim its planned funding levels by about $15 billion. the white house earlier this month said it plans to release president barack obama’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, which begins on oct. 1, on feb. 9. lockheed martin corp (lmt.n), maker of the f 35 fighter jet, boeing co (ba.n) and other big weapons makers are anxiously awaiting details about the budget and how it will affect their programs.  senior defense officials have said that the $15 billion in cuts would largely come from procurement accounts since personnel costs and operations costs were harder to cut. defense undersecretary frank kendall, the military’s chief weapons buyer, told reporters last month that the pentagon’s fiscal 2017 budget plan may slow production of key weapons programs, including the f 35 fighter jet.

" a coalition of 14 conservative groups urged u.s. lawmakers on wednesday to support an amendment to the house of representatives’ annual defense bill that would prevent the pentagon from implementing climate change and green energy policies meant to save taxpayers money and protect the planet. in a letter to the lawmakers, the groups said many climate programs “are likely to undermine military readiness by diverting scarce resources.” the programs in question were initiated by former president barack obama’s 2015 executive order requiring the military to meet green energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. the conservative groups are trying to gather support for republican representative warren davidson’s amendment to the house version of the national defense authorization act that would stop the military from implementing the policies. the groups include the competitive enterprise institute, a libertarian advocacy group; americans for prosperity, a group funded by the conservative koch brothers; and americans for limited government. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis has long been supportive of programs that reduce troops’ petroleum dependence. in written testimony to a senate panel after his confirmation hearing in january, mattis said “climate change can be a driver of instability” and is “a challenge that requires a broader, whole of government response.” the house bill includes language from democratic representative jim langevin that would require the pentagon to report to congress on military bases that are most vulnerable from rising seas and other effects of climate change. it is uncertain whether davidson’s or langevin’s measures would be in the final house bill. the house is due to vote this week on its version of the defense bill and the senate version will follow later this year.      myron ebell, the head of global warming and international environmental policy at the competitive enterprise institute, who also led president donald trump’s transition team for the environmental protection agency, said in an interview that the defense department “needs to concentrate on its core mission and not waste a lot of time with irrelevant distractions that gain them some political cover.”  when asked about mattis’ position on climate, ebell said he had heard generals say for years that climate change is a risk and “i’ve never listened to one who seemed to have the slightest clue as to what he was talking about.” the defense department, the largest u.s. consumer of energy, is planning to forge ahead with a decade long effort to convert operations to green energy.

" refugees have left one of australia s offshore detention centers on sunday for the united states, an asylum seeker and a refugee advocate said, as part of a swap brokered by former u.s. president barack obama last year. refugee action coalition s ian rintoul told reuters he had spoken with some of the group by phone and that 22 men were in port moresby on sunday night. rintoul said the group had been told they would be flown to the united states via the philippines on wednesday.  they re happy they re going, and they never want to hear about australia again,  he said, speaking from sydney. kurdish iranian journalist behrouz boochani, who has been held at the manus island detention center in papua new guinea, said in a facebook post that  about 25 men   had left the center around 8am local time. australia s department of immigration and border control did not respond to requests for comment on the move on sunday.  the move comes days after prime minister malcolm turnbull gave the first official timetable for when the 1,250 people in the centers on manus island and nauru would be resettled in the us. turnbull said australia would begin resettling several dozen central american refugees within weeks under the deal that u.s. president donald trump described as  dumb  but has nevertheless said washington will honor.  there will be about 25 from both manus and nauru (that) will be going to the united states and i just want to thank again president trump for continuing with that arrangement,  turnbull said in a video statement. while trump has said he would honor the swap agreement, concerns remain about how many asylum seekers will be resettled from the australian run centers.

" gunmen killed at least four people and wounded nearly 40 on wednesday in a suicide attack on a court complex in the libyan city of misrata, officials and a witness said. islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement run by the group s amaq news agency it had targeted  one of the most prominent strongholds  of libya s u.n. backed government of national accord (gna). the attack shows the enduring militant threat in libya after a misrata led coalition under nominal gna command battled for more than six months last year to oust islamic state from its former stronghold in sirte, about 230 km (140 miles) southeast of misrata. since then, militants have been trying to regroup in the desert south of sirte. they have stepped up their presence in remote areas, though attacks in urban centers have been rare.             wednesday s attack was launched by several assailants who drove up to the complex in central misrata in a black vehicle, a witness said.  one of them blew himself up at the gate and the other two with kalashnikovs opened fire at random,  he said.  shooting could be heard all over the city center after the attack.  the witness, who asked not to be named, said he believed the attackers had used rocket propelled grenades. the military alliance from misrata that led the campaign in sirte said two suicide attackers were involved in the operation, and that there had been an explosion after a gun battle lasting about 20 minutes. the attackers killed four and wounded 39, misrata hospital said in a statement, listing names of victims. two of the attackers blew themselves up and a third was killed during the gun battle, said a local security source, speaking on condition of anonymity. bomb disposal experts also defused a booby trapped car that had been packed with explosives to be used in the attack, he said. misrata, a large commercial port about 190 km east of tripoli, is one of libya s major military power bases but the city itself has been largely immune from armed clashes and attacks in recent years. dozens of islamic state suspects are being held in the city. libya slid into turmoil after a nato backed uprising that toppled long time leader muammar gaddafi six years ago. it remains divided between loose political and military alliances based in the east and west, resulting in a security vacuum in the center of the country. as militants increased their activity in recent weeks to the south and east of sirte, the united states launched two sets of air strikes against jihadist desert camps. the u.s. also provided air support for the misrata led campaign last year.

" vietnam’s prime minister has urged a greater u.s. role in preventing militarization and island building in the south china sea, the government said on tuesday, in a rare call for washington’s support to curb beijing’s maritime expansionism. during a summit of southeast asian countries in california on monday, premier nguyen tan dung suggested to u.s. president barack obama that washington uses a stronger voice and “more practical and more efficient actions”, in comments likely to rile china. tension has spiked since beijing’s construction of seven islands in the spratly archipelago. “prime minister dung suggested the united states has a stronger voice and more practical and more efficient actions requesting termination of all activities changing the status quo,” the government said on its news website. the statement did not specifically name china, but it said dung was referring especially to “large scale construction of artificial islands” and “militarization”. with a large u shaped line on its official maps, china claims most of the south china sea. malaysia, the philippines, taiwan, brunei and vietnam have rival claims. obama and allies from southeast asia will turn their attention to china on tuesday on the second day of a summit intended to improve trade and provide a united front on maritime disputes with beijing. whereas china accuses the united states of seeking maritime hegemony in asia, washington says its interest in the south china sea is preserving freedom of navigation. in recent months, the united states raised the stakes by sending guided missile destroyers uss lassen and uss curtis wilbur close to disputed areas occupied by beijing.    though communist vietnam routinely opposes china’s activities in disputed waters, its leaders are usually wary of provoking a giant neighbor with which it shares over $60 billion of annual trade and maintains close ideological ties. dung has earned popularity in vietnam for pursuing stronger u.s. trade and defense links and for taking a tougher line against china, compared to measured responses by other vietnamese leaders to beijing’s assertiveness. dung was controversially overlooked by the politburo last month in its nomination for party chief, meaning the end of his political career when his term ends this year, posing a possible blow for washington. dung also asked obama to fully lift a lethal arms embargo on vietnam, which would be an “important way to strengthen political trust”, the government website quoted him saying. obama will visit vietnam in may, the white house said.

" the government of peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski will likely object to a bill passed by congress that aims to expand new anti graft restrictions to grana y montero and other local partners of brazilian builder odebrecht [odbes.ul], the prime minister said thursday. odebrecht has admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes to officials in peru over a decade long period, and lawmakers want the financial constraints written to keep odebrecht from evading payment of fines for bribery to apply to the companies it partnered with. but prime minister mercedes araoz said a new bill that sailed through the opposition ruled congress two weeks ago threatens to paralyze construction projects and likely violates due process.  i m not a lawyer but i do think that you always have to respect the presumption of innocence,  araoz told foreign media in the capital lima.  there are parts of it that we would have to take issue with.  araoz said congress has not yet sent the bill to the executive branch for passage and that the justice and economy ministries would study it thoroughly before taking any action. the legislation would restrict international asset transfers and the right to seize  ill gotten gains  of grana and other odebrecht partners. however, none of odebrecht s local partners have been convicted of any crimes and deny taking part in odebrecht s bribes. grana, peru s biggest construction group and odebrecht s most important local partner, saw its shares drop nearly 23 percent to 2.4 soles ( 0.5573) after passage of the legislation. grana did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has criticized the bill as unconstitutional and promised to take legal action if it becomes law. lawmakers who back the legislation have said odebrecht s partners likely had a hand in odebrecht s kickback schemes and that prosecutors were working too slowly in finding other guilty parties. grana is under investigation in the attorney general s office but has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. araoz added that the government is planning to ask congress for special legislative powers to make tax collection more efficient. however, she said the changes would be minor and ruled out any changes to tax rates.

[l4n1lo3t7] fifty seven companies said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of brexit, which is due to take place in march 2019.  another 37 said brexit would have no impact, and the remainder said they are still deciding what to do or declined to comment. the survey was conducted by email and telephone interviews between aug. 21 and sept. 15. a total of 55 banks responded, along with 37 insurers and insurance brokers, 28 asset managers and private equity firms, and three exchanges. they included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in europe, the middle east and africa in 2016, according to thomson reuters  data. some participants declined to comment on some of the questions. some participants also asked for the information to be part of an aggregate only, which is why reuters has not published the complete data. the insurers who responded to the survey included the largest listed insurers in britain, along with large european union and non eu insurers operating in britain, major insurance brokers and listed and unlisted insurers with an international focus, such as those operating in the lloyd s of london market. twenty eight asset managers managing a collective $25 trillion responded. they included most of the global managers who use the uk as a base in europe, as well as the leading british firms. survey participants were asked if brexit would mean new jobs in the european union and if so, to give details about whether they would be new jobs or transfers from london. they were also asked how many uk employees they currently have. seventy five organizations provided the number of staff they currently employ in the uk, which added together totaled 484,578. of those 357,617 were employed by banks, 106,348 by insurers, 16,363 by asset managers and 4,250 by exchanges. the 39 firms which gave details on their plans for brexit staffing together employ at least 359,983 people. a precise number could not be calculated because four did not answer the question. the 20 banks in the survey who answered the question about how many jobs would be affected by brexit said they expected 9,777 jobs to be moved or created in the eu.  eleven insurers expected 98 roles to be created in the eu in total. eight asset managers and private equity firms who gave the information saw 311 jobs in total being created. of banks who have made a decision on what to do about brexit, six planned to add jobs in frankfurt, four in paris, three in dublin, two in amsterdam, one in berlin and one in brussels. among insurers, seven were setting up subsidiaries in luxembourg, six in dublin, three in brussels, and one each in malta, munich and paris. for the asset managers, nine said they were considering moving staff to another country or hiring locally there. the most popular destination was luxembourg, chosen by seven firms, followed by dublin with one and one undecided. there are 344 banks registered in britain, according to the bank of england, although that includes the domestic focused subsidiaries of many larger banks as well as many smaller lenders that earn the bulk of their revenue in britain so won t be affected so much by brexit. there are 503 uk authorized insurers, according to the bank of england, though many larger firms have more than one authorization. many uk insurers also have a purely domestic focus, insurance specialists say. while the asset managers contacted account for the lion s share of the assets managed in britain, there remains a long tail of smaller managers registered with the financial conduct authority, a figure it currently puts at 1,840 firms.

" a revised republican bill to dismantle obamacare moving through the u.s. house of representatives would lead to the same number of americans losing health insurance as under the initial plan, the non partisan congressional budget office said on thursday. the cbo said the revised bill would raise the number of uninsured in 2026 by 24 million, compared to current law. in an analysis of the initial bill, it had also said 24 million more americans would end up uninsured.

" in addition to picking the next u.s. president on tuesday, voters in four states will decide on ballot initiatives related to energy and the environment. the results of the initiatives could offer a gauge of americans’ feelings about managing carbon dioxide emissions, regulating solar power, and handling local opposition to hydraulic fracturing. here are descriptions of the various initiatives: washington state voters will decide whether to adopt a measure to create the country’s first carbon tax. initiative 732 would slap a $15 price tag on a ton of carbon for utilities and refiners in 2017, with the price rising gradually each year until it reaches $100. the tax would be revenue neutral: money raised would replace old revenue from sales and business taxes. supporters say the tax would bring down emissions without burdening state residents. but the measure has brought together unlikely allies from industry groups who say it would hurt businesses’ bottom lines and environmental organizations like the sierra club who say it does not create new revenue to invest in clean energy and mass transit. other groups argue it could hurt lower income communities. florida’s electric utilities have sponsored a measure that could affect how the state regulates private use of solar energy. a confusingly worded amendment 1 would alter the state’s constitution to protect the right to own or lease solar equipment, while also ensuring that electricity consumers who do not use solar energy “are not required to subsidize the costs of back up power and electric grid access to those who do.” supporters say it enshrines the rights of solar users, but opponents say it is a sneaky way of letting the state block ‘net metering,’ in which a solar user can sell unused energy on the grid at market value. floridians for solar choice say the measure would “choke off” the state’s nascent rooftop solar industry. colorado voters will vote on a measure that would make it harder to change the state’s constitution by requiring broad support across all state districts for signatories to petitions and a higher percentage threshold  to be approved.  opponents of hydraulic fracturing, an oil and gas drilling technique they say causes water pollution, claim amendment 71 would make it harder for local communities to block fracking projects. the amendment was written and funded by oil and gas industry groups but does not directly address the controversial practice. colorado is one of several u.s. states that has seen a surge in fracking in recent years. scores of towns across the country, including several in colorado, have tried to ban it. nevada voters will decide whether to open up the state’s energy market to competition by giving consumers the option to decide where they buy their power. the measure comes after state regulators last year approved a rate increase for customers with rooftop solar panels, causing solar companies to lay off workers. currently, nevada law allows investor owned utility companies to be monopolies in their service territories. supported by environmentalists as well as electric carmaker tesla, mgm resorts and other companies, the measure would let consumers choose an energy provider and sell the solar electricity they generate themselves. big companies that want to leave the grid can do so by paying hefty penalties to state regulators. if passed, the measure would direct the nevada legislature to pass legislation to create an open, competitive electricity market by mid 2023.

" u.s. president donald trump has designated white house budget director mick mulvaney acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the white house said on friday. the action came hours after richard cordray submitted his formal resignation and named a deputy director as his replacement, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the regulator’s leadership. “the president looks forward to seeing director mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the cfpb’s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,” the white house said in its statement. democratic lawmakers are eager to preserve the regulator for as long as possible while republicans want to put in place new leadership to chart a drastically different course.  the six year old bureau has policed consumer financial markets, drafting aggressive rules curbing products like payday loans, while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like wells fargo. but republicans have consistently complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from congress on its operations, and they are eager to take control. mulvaney, who has criticized the bureau in the past, said, “i look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission, while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer.” the succession plan has never been tested, with cordray as its first and only full time director. cordray had previously announced plans to resign by the end of november. in a statement to staff, he said that leandra english, the cfpb’s chief of staff, had been named deputy director and would take over as acting director of the agency upon his exit. however, the white house had already said it planned to name its own interim leadership at the regulator. trump has pushed to ease regulations on businesses, including the financial sector, a stance seemingly at odds with cordray’s more aggressive regulatory approach. earlier this month, white house deputy press secretary raj shah said that the administration “will announce an acting director and the president’s choice to replace mr cordray at the appropriate time.” there are competing theories in washington as to who can name cordray’s replacement. democrats point to language in the dodd frank law that created the cfpb, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves. but others say a separate law governing federal vacancies gives trump power to name someone elsewhere in the administration to that role temporarily, while the white house identifies a full time nominee who would be confirmed by the senate.

" the united nations reaffirmed on friday that torture is illegal and that refugees deserve protection, while ducking any direct criticism of remarks made by new u.s. president donald trump. major human rights groups have denounced trump’s stance on torture and warned against restoring a cia secret detention program for interrogating terror suspects. trump is also reviewing spending, including at the u.n., where the united states is the largest donor. “international human rights law is clear on the absolute prohibition on torture,” u.n. human rights spokesman rupert colville told a news briefing. pressed repeatedly to comment on trump’s remarks this week that torture “works”, colville noted that prominent u.s. senators including republican john mccain, himself a torture victim, and democrat dianne feinstein, who chaired an inquiry on the cia program under former president george w. bush, had spoken out. it was still very early days in terms of how the u.n. human rights office interacts with the new administration, he said.  “we have to work out strategically what is going to be effective.” the unhcr was also tepid in its comments on trump’s moves to restrict refugees. he is expected to sign an executive order that would include a temporary ban on all refugees, and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries. “of course unhcr believes that refugees should be offered assistance, protection, opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity,” unhcr spokeswoman vannina maestracci said. the u.s. department of homeland security has temporarily halted trips by staff to interview refugees abroad ahead of a likely shakeup of refugee policy by trump, two sources said on thursday. during the election campaign, trump decried former president barack obama’s decision to increase the number of syrian refugees admitted to the united states over fears that some fleeing the country’s civil war might carry out attacks. some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the united states between october and year end under unhcr’s program for the most vulnerable, maestracci said. a host of u.s. federal government agencies are involved and extensive background checks are carried out, she said. “i think it’s fair to say that refugees coming into the united states to be resettled are some of the most vetted individuals entering the united states,” maestracci said.

" a sluggish forecast for u.s. economic growth as well as an increase in u.s. states’ medicaid and pension contribution costs is creating a budgetary squeeze in many state capitols, according to a research report issued by s&p global ratings on monday.  while the risk of a recession within the next 12 months has fallen into a 15 20 percent range from 20 25 percent, the rate of economic expansion “is expected to remain fairly anemic at 1.8 percent over the longer term (roughly 10 years), well below the 3.0 percent average growth rate that prevailed from 1980 to 2000,” the report said. “and while the risk that federal policy could trigger a recession has eased, the potential for a dramatic scaling back of federal aid for medicaid has never been greater,” the report said. the slow growth economy is producing sluggish revenue trends for the states, said gabriel petek, an analyst at s&p, in a telephone interview.  s&p does not expect washington will enact a federally funded public infrastructure package in the next two years, which will put further stresses on state budget management. addressing deferred maintenance and inadequate capacity in public infrastructure will depend heavily on state and local government solutions, the report said. without a possible bump in growth from a federal infrastructure package, projected gdp growth for 2017 was lowered to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, the report said. “anything that is done at the federal level would imply that more of the burden has to be picked up by the state and local government level in the area of infrastructure investment,” petek said. the report added that the u.s. mid atlantic region (new jersey, new york and pennsylvania) will have the slowest growing economy compared to other regions. real gdp growth for the region is projected at 1.25 percent for 2017, the report said. the best performing region forecast for the current year, with an economic growth forecast of 2.88 percent is the mountain region (arizona, colorado, idaho, montana, nevada, new mexico, utah, wyoming). overall, regional economies growth rates are expected to peak in 2018 before some of those gains ebb, the report’s data showed. the best performing region forecast for 2018 are the states in the west south central region (texas, oklahoma, louisiana, arkansas) with a combined growth rate of 3.36 percent, followed closely by the mountain region at 3.29 percent and pacific region at 2.93 percent.

" czechs voted on friday in an election expected to hand power to businessman andrej babis who has won popular support by pledging to sweep aside traditional parties, boost investment and keep out refugees, but faces a criminal probe for suspected fraud. the central european country has enjoyed rapid economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the european union, but opinion polls nevertheless show strong voter support for babis's ano movement and other protest parties. (graphic: czech legislative election   tmsnrt.rs/2vo4hpw) founded and tightly controlled by the 63 year old billionaire, ano   which means  yes  in czech   has won support from both right and left with promises to cut taxes, turf out corrupt politicians and bring business style efficiency to government.  we want to form a government and show people that government can work differently to what they are used to. we would be (more) in touch with them,  babis said after voting in the prague suburb where he lives. babis s support has weathered investigation into tax strategies at his empire of food, chemicals, farming and media   worth an estimated $4 billion   that he owned until moving it to a trust fund this year.  he has also been charged by police with fraud on suspicion that he hid ownership of a farm and a conference center so it could receive a 2 million euro subsidy in 2008. he denies any wrongdoing. ano has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving as a junior partner in the outgoing government along with prime minister bohuslav sobotka s center left social democrats and the centrist christian democrats. final surveys before a polling blackout began on tuesday gave ano about 25 27 percent support, at least twice that of the social democrats.    previous governments kept saying what needs to be changed but did nothing,  said jarmila, a 66 year old former teacher in prague who refused to give her last name.  he is rational and can explain things.   czech elections are spread over two days. voting began on friday at 2 p.m. (1200 gmt) and will end at 2 p.m. on saturday.   although immigration to the czech republic is virtually non existent, fear of it has played a big part in the election campaign, with most parties pledging to fight any attempts by the european union to force the czechs to accept refugees distributed across the bloc. the anti immigrant mood mirrors similar trends in neighbouring countries. parties opposed to immigration did well in germany s election in september and in austria s last week, and have fed scepticism toward the eu across the 28 nation bloc. babis s swipes at brussels have raised concern that he might lead the country into a more confrontational relationship with the eu, emulating the right wing governments in poland and hungary. babis opposes more eu integration and euro adoption, but has also spoken of the benefits of eu membership and says the czech republic should play a bigger role in reforming the bloc.  analysts say the election may lead to a similar coalition to the outgoing government but led by ano, which would mean no big change in a foreign policy. a deal with ano s current partners, or with center right parties, may run up against their demands that babis personally stays out of the cabinet because of the police charges. a number of voters in prague expressed distrust of babis, who has been fighting allegations he had cooperated with communist era secret police.  for me this election is about our stance on the european union, refugees and is mainly (a chance to vote) against mr. babis,  said gabriela kijova, 23, after voting for the small pirate party in central prague. president milos zeman said on friday he would ask the leader of the biggest party to lead talks on a new government. he said he would allow a month for negotiations before he calls a session of the new parliament, which is the trigger for the departure of the outgoing administration.  there is an outside chance that babis may form a minority government supported by the communists and the far right, anti eu freedom and direct democracy party (spd), which saw its support jump in the final opinion polls. such a tie up would be negative for investors and pose questions over policies toward the eu.

" president donald trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the federal reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on thursday. trump met with current fed chair janet yellen on thursday. that meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list. “i don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said. other contenders to lead the u.s. central bank are top trump economic adviser gary cohn, fed board governor jerome powell, former fed governor kevin warsh and stanford university economics professor john taylor. [nl2n1ms2d8] powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with warsh, are seen as the top contenders. despite his time as fed governor under chair ben bernanke, warsh is seen as a less well known nominee. he has criticized the fed’s bond buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target. u.s. treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late thursday after politico reported that trump was leaning toward nominating powell for the job. trump leaves on nov. 3 for a tour of asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip. the president told reporters on tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “i’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” trump said. meanwhile, a member of the u.s. house of representatives’ freedom caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for yellen, the latest sign conservative republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the fed, which sets u.s. monetary policy. representative warren davidson, a republican on the house financial services committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. he is circulating a letter opposing yellen’s reappointment, the ohio congressman’s spokesman said. “davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds. members of the freedom caucus, the most conservative republican grouping in congress, have been critical of yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose. key members of the house financial services committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace yellen. taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a house passed bill requiring the fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules. the house, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a fed chief. the senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee. trump has criticized yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. but his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by yellen’s fed. cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in virginia.  but the top white house economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into trump’s good graces.

" the international community must remain united and enforce sanctions against north korea after its repeated launch of ballistic missiles, japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in an editorial published in the new york times on sunday. abe s editorial was published before world leaders gather in new york for a united nations general assembly meeting this week, where north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are expected to loom large over proceedings. north korea launched a missile over japan on friday, its second in the past three weeks, and conducted its sixth and by far most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3, in defiance of international pressure. such tests are in violation of u.n. security council resolutions and show that north korea can now target the united states or europe, abe said. diplomacy and dialogue will not work with north korea and concerted pressure by the entire international community is essential to tackle the threats posed by north korea, abe wrote. a week ago, the 15 member u.n. security council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

" argentina s lower house of congress will try on monday to debate the government s pension bill, lawmakers said on friday, after the first attempt at discussing it this week ended with violent protests that forced the legislature to suspend session. the bill, key to president mauricio macri s effort to lower business costs and reduce argentina s fiscal deficit, has already passed the senate, leaving the lower house to give final legislative approval. but thursday s debate was suspended after it sparked riots in the capital that were put down by police firing rubber bullets and tear gas. opposition protesters, politicians and unions say the legislation will hurt pensioners. for monday s debate, the bill will be amended to provide a bonus to the country s most needy retirees, the government said. the move may increase its chances of passage.  the amendment  will make a strong effort  to compensate those most in need, macri allied house member mario negri told reporters. the agreement to include the bonus came after a long meeting on friday among lawmakers, provincial governors and macri administration officials.  macri is aiming to cut the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product next year from 4.2 percent this year, and to reduce inflation to between 8 and 12 percent from above 20 percent this year. the pension bill would change the formula used to calculate benefits. payments would adjust every quarter based on inflation, rather than the current system of twice yearly adjustments linked to wage rises and tax revenue. economists say the current formula means benefits go up in line with past inflation. left unchanged, that could harm macri s efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. under the new formula, benefits would increase by 5 percentage points above inflation, according to cabinet chief marcos pena. the plan would take effect at a time of lower inflation expectations, hence slowing the pace of pension benefit increases.

" australia s embattled conservative prime minister malcolm turnbull has shaken off speculation about the security of his leadership, declaring on sunday he will lead his coalition government into the next election in 2019. turnbull, who has faced a horror run in recent weeks, losing his one seat majority and being called to stepdown before christmas, said that he  runs the government  and that his party s policies would soon be converted into public support.  i have every confidence that i will lead the coalition to the next election in 2019 and we will win it,  turnbull told sky news television.  i am very confident we will be able to see a disciplined approach to teamwork within the coalition.     three australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010. turnbull s confidence has been bolstered by the stunning by election victory of his former deputy prime minister, barnaby joyce, who easily cruised to victory on saturday night with a huge 65 percent primary vote. barnaby was kicked out of parliament just over one month ago because he held dual citizenship with new zealand, a status he has since rescinded. under australia s constitution dual citizens are banned from the national parliament. barnaby s win restores turnbull s slim one seat majority in parliament and turnbull, who is struggling with record low opinion polls, has claimed the victory as a vote of confidence in his performance. turnbull has been under sustained attack for much of the year over issues including same sex marriage and the scandal plagued banking sector, and has failed to end widespread disquiet within his coalition about his future as leader. on friday, the conservative deputy premier of new south wales state john barilaro called for turnbull to step down as a  christmas gift  to the nation. the comment came just days after turnbull was forced into an embarrassing policy reversal and called a royal commission into the country s banking and financial sector amid mounting political pressure. turnbull has failed to stem a flow of disgruntled voters away from his conservative coalition to far right parties and the fragility of his government has been exacerbated by a dual citizenship crisis which is forcing a number of lawmakers, like barnaby, to recontest seats. one of those by elections for the blue ribbon conservative electorate of bennelong in sydney on dec. 16 could see turnbull again lose his majority in parliament if the opposition labor achieves a surprise win.

" u.s. president donald trump on friday questioned facebook inc s (fb.o) decision to overhaul how it handles paid political advertisements amid investigations into alleged russian interference in u.s. elections.  the russia hoax continues, now it s ads on facebook,  trump wrote on twitter.  what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary,  referring to hillary clinton, his rival in the 2016 presidential campaign.  earlier this month, facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to congress but said on thursday it would do so, making a concession to u.s. lawmakers who have threatened to regulate the world s largest social network over ads that run during election campaigns. chief executive mark zuckerberg said facebook, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on facebook, no matter whom they target. facebook also will demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under u.s. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media. zuckerberg said on thursday the changes would help address concerns that governments including russia are using facebook ads to meddle in other countries  elections. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia engaged in cyber attacks to sway the 2016 election against democrat hillary clinton in favor of trump. u.s. congressional investigators and a special counsel are investigating the matter. moscow has denied any interference. while trump dismissed the advertisement controversy, his secretary of state, rex tillerson, expressed concern.  well, i think all of these social media providers are faced with many challenges,  tillerson said on abc s  good morning america,  pointing to their use by militant groups around the world as well as in election campaigns.   but they also have responsibilities,  he said.  and i think they re going to have to think carefully about their responsibilities in this regard.  u.s. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.

" israel is willing to resort to military action to ensure iran never acquires nuclear weapons, the intelligence minister said on thursday in japan where he is seeking backing for u.s. president donald trump s tougher line on tehran. trump said on oct. 13 he would not certify iran is complying with an agreement on curtailing its nuclear program, signed by his predecessor, barack obama, opening a 60 day window for congress to act to reimpose sanctions.  if international efforts led these days by u.s. president trump don t help stop iran attaining nuclear capabilities, israel will act militarily by itself,  intelligence minister israel katz said in an interview in tokyo.  there are changes that can be made (to the agreement) to ensure that they will never have the ability to have a nuclear weapon.  israel has taken unilateral action in the past without the consent of its major ally, the united states, including air strikes on a suspected nuclear reactor in syria in 2007 and in iraq in 1981. a strike against iran, however, would be a risky venture with the potential to provoke a counter strike and roil financial markets. an israeli threat of military strikes could, nonetheless, galvanize support in the united states for toughening up the nuclear agreement but it could also backfire by encouraging hardliners in iran and widening a rift between washington and european allies. so far, none of the other signatories to the deal   britain, france, germany, russia, china, iran and the european union   has cited serious concerns, leaving the united states isolated. japan relies on the u.s. military to help defend it against threats from north korea and elsewhere. tokyo s diplomatic strategy in the middle east, where it buys almost all its oil, is to maintain friendly relations with all countries, including iran.   i asked the japanese government to support steps led by president trump to change the nuclear agreement,  said katz, who is a member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s right wing likud party.  the question of whether japanese companies will begin to work in iran or not is a very important question.  katz s visit to tokyo comes ahead of a planned trip by trump from nov. 5 for a summit with prime minister shinzo abe. officials at japan s ministry of foreign affairs were not immediately available to comment. israel, katz said, wants the nuclear agreement to be revised to remove an expiration date, and to impose tighter conditions to stop tehran from developing new centrifuges used to make weapons grade nuclear material.  he also urged sanctions to stop iran from establishing  syria as a military base to launch attacks on israel and action to put a halt to tehran s development of ballistic missiles.  we will not allow iran to transform syria into forward base sea harbors, air bases and shia militias,  he said.  we will act together with the united states and other countries in the world until they stop the ballistic missiles that threaten israel.   the u.s. house of representatives on wednesday backed new sanctions on lebanon s iran backed hezbollah militia.

" gary cohn, president donald trump’s top economic adviser, drafted a letter of resignation over the administration’s weak response to recent clashes between neo nazis and anti racism protesters, but decided to stay on the job, the new york times reported on friday. cohn spoke publicly about the controversy for the first time in an interview with the financial times newspaper, saying the administration needed to clearly reject hate groups. he said  there was no equivalence between white supremacists or neo nazis and those who protest inequality. “i believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,” the former goldman sachs president told the newspaper. “citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo nazis, and the kkk,” he added. cohn’s criticism came nearly two weeks after white supremacist and neo nazi activists clashed with anti racism protesters in charlottesville, virginia, over a plan to remove a statue of robert e. lee, a confederate general in the u.s. civil war. a man thought to have neo nazi sympathies drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen others. following the clashes, trump said there had been violence on “both sides,” remarks that spurred condemnation by both republican and democratic politicians.  cohn stood nearby during an impromptu trump tower news conference as the president insisted there were “very fine people on both sides” in charlottesville. cohn considered resigning over trump’s response, both newspapers reported, citing sources.  cohn went so far as to draft a resignation letter, the new york times reported, citing two people familiar with the document. cohn said he felt “compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks” and came under intense pressure to quit over trump’s reaction to the incident but decided against it. “as a jewish american, i will not allow neo nazis ranting ‘jews will not replace us’ to cause this jew to leave his job,” he said, referring to chants by neo nazis in charlottesville. “i feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. we must all unite together against them.” ",0
" top united nations officials warned the security council on monday that its sanctions on north korea over the country s nuclear and missile programs may be harming the delivery of humanitarian aid to the impoverished, isolated asian state.  the 15 member security council held its fourth annual meeting on human rights abuses in north korea, despite objections by china, who said it was not the right forum and warned the move could further escalate tensions in the region. u.n. human rights chief zeid ra ad al hussein said u.n. agencies and aid groups were  literally a life line  for some 13 million vulnerable north koreans,  but sanctions may be adversely affecting this essential help.  zeid and deputy u.n. political affairs chief miroslav jenca said aid groups were facing difficulties accessing international banking channels, transporting goods into the north korea, and rising fuel prices hindering delivery of aid. in an oct. 27 letter to the council sanctions committee on north korea, seen by reuters, the top u.n. official in pyongyang, tapan mishra, also said there were customs problems.  crucial relief items, including medical equipment and drugs, have been held up for months despite being equipped with the required paperwork affirming that they are not on the list of sanctioned items,  mishra wrote.   zeid asked the security council on monday to assess the impact of the sanctions on human rights and take action  to minimize their adverse humanitarian consequences.  in a statement on friday, the council sanctions committee reiterated that the nine sanctions resolutions adopted since 2006  are not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population  of north korea. north korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights abuses and blames sanctions for the humanitarian situation.  the north korean u.n. mission condemned monday s meeting  as a desperate act of the hostile forces which lose the political and military confrontation with the dprk (north korea) that has openly risen to the position of nuclear weapon state.  japan s u.n. ambassador koro bessho told reporters on monday:  the humanitarian situation and human rights situation in north korea is very dire and that s because of the authorities.  for the fourth time, china unsuccessfully tried to stop the public meeting by calling a procedural vote. a minimum of nine votes are needed to win such a vote and china, russia, the united states, britain and france cannot wield their vetoes. ten members voted in favor of the meeting, china, russia and bolivia voted against, and egypt and ethiopia abstained.   council members and relevant parties should engage themselves with finding ways to ease tensions on the peninsula. they should avoid mutual provocation and words or actions that might further escalate the situation,  china s deputy u.n. ambassador wu haitao told the council. he said the discussion of human rights in north korea was counterproductive.  the systematic human rights violations and abuses of the north korean government are more than the cause of its people s suffering. they are a means to a single end: keeping the kim jong un regime in power,  u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley told the council. the security council is due to hold a ministerial meeting on north korea s nuclear and missiles programs on friday.

" an outspoken deputy of cambodia s detained opposition leader fled the country on tuesday, saying she feared for her safety after prime minister hun sen threatened further arrests of opposition politicians. kem sokha, leader of the opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp), was arrested on sept. 3 and charged with treason in a widening crackdown on critics of hun sen, which his opponents say is a ploy to win an election next year.  without a true opposition and with the wide level of fear, there s no hope for free and fair elections in 2018,  mu sochua, 63, told reuters after leaving cambodia, adding that she  did not feel safe .  democracy in cambodia is very rapidly eroding to a point where no other opposing forces are left to fight dictatorship,  she said. government spokesman phay siphan said mu sochua had  left of her own choice  and he did not know whether authorities had planned to arrest her. known internationally for campaigns to fight sex trafficking and assert women s rights, mu sochua had been among the most vocal opposition politicians in cambodia since kem sokha was arrested and accused of plotting to take power with u.s. help. she told reuters last week that around half the cnrp s members of parliament had fled the country in fear. hun sen, who has ruled for more than three decades, threatened more arrests of opposition politicians on monday, attacking them as  rebels in the city  bent on staging a  colour revolution  despite past failures. western countries have condemned the arrest of kem sokha and called for his release, saying the credibility of next year s election is in doubt, but they have given no sign of taking measures against the government. meanwhile, china has voiced support for the government of hun sen, 65. he is a former commander in the khmer rouge who later defected from the group whose genocide devastated cambodia in the 1970s. strong gains by the cnrp at local council elections in june had pointed to a tough battle for hun sen in next year s general election. despite years of annual economic growth of around 7 percent that have helped transform cambodia from a failed state, popular anger has grown over inequality and accusations of cronyism. in his first comments since his arrest, kem sokha said in a facebook posting on monday that he was seeking positive change in cambodia through the ballot box and not through revolution as charged. one of his three deputies remains in cambodia. the evidence presented against kem sokha so far is a video from 2013 in which he tells supporters that he has support from unidentified americans for a plan to gain power.

" the european union told britain on tuesday it must make more concessions in talks over its departure from the bloc, offering little hope of a breakthrough for prime minister theresa may at a summit later this week. may traveled to brussels on monday for dinner with senior eu officials, hoping to nudge the brexit talks forward to look at future ties which she says will help london make advances on calculating a financial settlement. but hours after the dinner, ministers from eu countries, even those such as the netherlands that have much to lose if there is no brexit deal, said may needed to go further on detailing how much britain will pay when it leaves the bloc. after losing her governing conservatives  majority in a june election and struggling through the party s annual conference, may has little room for maneuver   unable to increase her offer on the brexit bill for fear of angering her own party.  we, the 27 together, find it extremely important that substantial progress is made on all three areas,  dutch foreign minister bert koenders told reporters. but he also said the eu would offer may an olive branch at their summit on friday by saying they would start preparing among themselves for talks on a post brexit transition in order to be able to engage with britain swiftly after london delivers.  i hope that in the uk the reality comes in that this is a possibility to come to the next stage in december,  koenders said in luxembourg where ministers were preparing for the summit this thursday and friday. after the brussels dinner on monday, may and european commission chief jean claude juncker said the pace of brexit negotiations should be stepped up after they stalled largely over the size of the divorce bill. the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier struck a note of caution on tuesday.  it takes two to accelerate,  he told reporters as he arrived to brief eu ministers in luxembourg.  one step after another... we are not finished with the first step.  neither side signaled there would be much movement at the eu summit after five rounds of talks, and some eu ministers in luxembourg on tuesday said it was hard to negotiate with a prime minister under pressure from brexit hardliners.  sometimes it s very difficult to see and understand what britain really wants from these negotiations,  said finland s deputy minister, samuli virtanen.  it seems that at the moment eu 27 is more unanimous than uk 1.  with only 17 months before britain leaves, the lack of progress in the talks have prompted companies to get ready not only for london leaving without a deal but also for a prolonged lack of certainty which makes investment decisions difficult. britain s brexit minister david davis said separately that london had no plans to walk away from the negotiations and that he hoped the looming eu summit would  build on the momentum and spirit of cooperation we now have.  at the summit in brussels on thursday and friday, may is due to set out britain s brexit position and then leave the room as the other eu leaders discuss the progress of the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union. according to a draft of the conclusions for the summit, the eu are unlikely to agree with may that it is time to move the talks forward, but will instead suggest starting a discussion on transition among themselves. that comes after may also talked on the phone with german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron in recent days, with sources saying both paris and berlin rebuffed her advances and stuck to the eu line. foreign minister boris johnson told the british parliament on tuesday he hoped  our friends and partners  in the eu would discuss the transition period, saying  if we re going to get on to that kind of question, now is the time for them to do so . british officials have increasingly accepted that friday will not bring the breakthrough they had hoped for, but believe an improved tone may mean that might not be too far off.  the pm is pleased with how the dinner went, it was productive, it was a friendly discussion,  a may spokesman said.  we have been absolutely clear that we can only resolve the financial implications of the uk s withdrawal and other issues as part of the settlement of all the issues.  but members of her party have reduced may s room for maneuver, with some brexit campaigners saying if there was no progress on friday, the prime minister should walk away.  it s all about the money and if she ups the bid now, that is a really hard sell politically,  a senior source in may s governing conservative party told reuters.

" islamic state flags are not flying in bosnia, prime minister denis zvizdic said on tuesday, dismissing allegations by some european leaders that radical bosnian muslims in the balkan country were posing a terrorist threat for europe. bosnian muslims generally practice a moderate form of islam but some have adopted radical salafi islam from foreign fighters who came to the country during its 1992 95 war to fight alongside muslims against orthodox serbs and catholic croats. some joined islamic state in syria and iraq but police said departures had stopped completely in the past 18 months and more than half of those who returned have been jailed under a law prohibiting people to fight in foreign countries. czech president milos zeman has said there was a risk islamic state may form its european base in bosnia, where  isis (islamic state) black flags are already flying in several towns , according to reports.  croatian president kolinda grabar kitarovic has warned of  thousands of fighters returning to bosnia from syria and iraq , while croatian magazine globus last week put the number of radicalized bosnian muslims at 5,000 10,000. zvizdic said such allegations were unfounded and politically motivated and could damage bosnia as an investment and tourism destination.   isis flags are not flying in bosnia,  zvizdic told reporters after meeting the security minister and the heads of five security and intelligence agencies.       there have been no departures to foreign war zones, we have not had any incident that could be characterized as an act of terrorism and we work to prevent the possibility of any such incident,  zvizdic said, referring to the last two years during which several terrorist attacks took place across europe.   bosnia s security agencies say a total of 240 bosnian citizens have departed to fight for islamic state since 2012, and 116 remained there. out of 44 who had returned to bosnia, 23 were jailed. security minister dragan mektic said terrorism threats in bosnia were mainly external and its agencies last month prevented a person with possible links to terrorists from entering the country.  in 2015, two bosnian army soldiers and a policeman were killed in two separate attacks in bosnia. no links to wider groups was found.

" french prime minister edouard philippe has shrugged off nationwide protests against planned reforms to france s strict labor regulations, saying on wednesday he was  listening  but would nonetheless press ahead with the bill. in a sign that popular protest could gain momentum, truck drivers belonging to france s second and third largest unions said they would launch a rolling strike on sept 25 to force the government into a reversal. trucker strikes previously brought large parts of france to a halt, hurting the economy.  more than 200,000 trade unionists turned out on tuesday for the first mass protests against the labor market reforms on tuesday, part of a series of measures on macron s agenda for change. others, including reform to the unemployment benefits and pension systems, are likely to be even more contested. the government plans to adopt the decrees on sept. 22.    i am listening and i am paying attention. but let me state that the french, when they vote, also have a right to be treated with respect,  philippe told france 2 television.  and the reform that we are putting in place was announced by the president at the time of his election.  labor unions have thwarted previous attempts by governments on the political right and left to weaken france s strict labor code. in a change of tack, macron s administration spent weeks negotiating its proposals with union bosses over the summer. last month, the government set out measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals judged unfair and greater freedom for companies to hire and fire. the reform makes no direct reference to the 35 hour week, a totem of the labor code, though it hands firms more flexibility to set pay and working conditions. macron, a 39 year old former banker, inadvertently fueled worker anger when he declared on a trip to athens that he  would cede no ground to slackers, cynics and hardliners.   the elysee palace said his comments were aimed at political leaders who had shirked ambitious reform in the past, but union leaders and political opponents on the left accused him of treating workers with contempt. protesters in cities across france hit back too. in paris some carried placards reading  slacker on strike  while in bordeaux demonstrators chanted:  macron you re screwed, the slackers are in the streets.  jerome verite, secretary general of the cgt union s transport federation on wednesday told reuters the truckers  strike would  last as long as necessary.   we re headed for a social disaster. we want the government to reverse course on its decrees,  he said.

" president donald trump’s review of post crisis banking rules could sound the death knell for new global standards now being finalized and rip apart a common approach to regulating international lenders, bankers and regulators said. central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007 2009 financial crisis, but there are fears that project could unravel after trump said he wants the u.s. to row back on capital rules.     trump’s order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements, known as basel iii.  given that the united states wants to shrink the banking rule book, there are doubts over whether the basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they don’t have backing from the united states. without support from the world’s biggest capital market, other countries would be less willing to commit too. the core aim of the outstanding part of basel iii that regulators are working on   dubbed basel iv by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements   is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans.     jpmorgan chief executive jamie dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that european rivals had been “a lot more aggressive” than american banks in calculating capital, meaning they were holding less.      european policymakers have rejected that criticism, but their region’s banks have been lobbying against the remaining basel rules, saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold.      if the united states fails to approve the completion of basel iii, the perceived problem that european banks get away with holding less capital than u.s. lenders may not be properly tackled, a source involved in the negotiations said.      “it’s in the interests of american banks to get this done,” the source said. others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after trump’s intervention. “it’s going to delay completing basel iii, and perhaps lead to it not being concluded,” an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity. “i do fear that basel iv is doomed,” a banking industry official added. there are headwinds from elsewhere, too. patrick mchenry, republican vice chairman of the house financial services committee, fired a warning shot at federal reserve governor janet yellen about the basel talks in a letter dated jan. 31, ahead of trump’s executive order. the fed must “cease” all attempts to negotiate binding standards “burdening american business” until the trump administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritize “america’s best interests”, mchenry said.     while lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms, regulators said trump’s intervention in banking rules gives more clout to mchenry’s warning. the basel committee declined to comment. trump’s decision to review existing, post crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country. mario draghi, president of the european central bank, which regulates the euro zone’s main lenders, said on monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability. draghi was chairman of the group of 20 economies’ (g20)  regulatory task force, the financial stability board, which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards. a former regulator said the united states would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on u.s. banking competitiveness globally.    “it’s early days, but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from washington is worrying,” said david wright, a former top eu official who was part of crisis era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus.    “if you break international consensus, you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end,” said wright, now at flint global, which advises companies on regulatory matters. wright was referring to what was seen in the run up to the financial crisis, when countries like britain resorted to a “light touch” approach to banks to make london a more attractive financial center. valdis dombrovskis, the eu’s financial services chief, said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue. much will hinge on how much regulatory change trump can actually push through. former democratic congressman barney frank, who jointly sponsored the dodd frank act that trump wants to review, told the bbc last week he does not expect congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules, but the trump administration could pressure u.s. regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements.    anil kashyap, a bank of england policymaker, said last month that trump’s nomination for the powerful role of fed vice chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the u.s. approach to international rule making. it will have a “huge impact”, a regulatory source added.    the fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the basel committee and the financial stability board could be abandoned by the united states under trump. jose ignacio goirigolzarri, chairman of

" the palestinian islamist group hamas named as its new deputy chief on thursday a formerly turkey based commander whom israel has accused of orchestrating a lethal triple kidnapping that helped trigger the 2014 gaza war. saleh al arouri s promotion comes as hamas seeks to close ranks with u.s. backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a decade old schism, in an entente israel says will not revive peace talks unless hamas recognizes its right to exist and disarms. the palestinian information center, a hamas linked news site, said arouri, who was born in the occupied west bank and was exiled by israel in 2010 after long stints in its prisons, had been elected as deputy to the group s leader ismail haniyeh.  he (arouri) is now the hamas movement s no. 2 man,  the site said.  twenty three years of detention and expulsion have not weakened the resolve of the leader saleh al arouri, 51.  after three israeli teens were abducted and killed in the west bank in june 2014, arouri   then in istanbul   claimed responsibility in the name of hamas. israel responded with a west bank security sweep which, along with the revenge killing of a palestinian youth from jerusalem by a group of israelis, spiraled into a 50 day war in the gaza strip, hamas  fiefdom. gaza health officials say 2,100 palestinians were killed in the conflict, while israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians. israel also pressed ankara s islamist rooted government to crack down on arouri, describing him as the mastermind of the kidnappings and other hamas militant attacks. hamas sources said arouri left turkey in late 2015 for qatar and later lebanon. they declined to give his current location.

" senior russian intelligence and political officials discussed how to influence donald trump through his advisers according to information gathered by american spies last summer, the new york times reported on wednesday, citing three current and former u.s. officials familiar with the intelligence, the newspaper said the conversations focused on paul manafort, then the trump presidential campaign chairman, and michael flynn, a retired general who was then advising trump. u.s. congressional committees and a special counsel named by the justice department this month are investigating whether there was russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election and the possibility of collusion between trump’s campaign and russia. the controversy has engulfed trump’s young administration since he fired fbi director james comey two weeks ago amid the agency’s investigation of possible russia ties. moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and trump denies any collusion. the new york times report was the latest indication of the depth of concerns within the u.s. intelligence community about russian efforts to tip november’s election toward trump as he battled democrat hillary clinton. on may 18, reuters reported that flynn and other advisers to trump’s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, citing current and former u.s. officials.     on tuesday, former cia director john brennan told lawmakers he had noticed contacts between associates of trump’s campaign and russia during the campaign and grew concerned moscow had sought to lure americans down “a treasonous path.” in its report, the new york times said some russians boasted about how well they knew flynn, who was subsequently named trump’s national security adviser before being dismissed less than a month after the republican took office. others discussed leveraging their ties to viktor yanukovych, the deposed president of ukraine living in exile in russia, who at one time had worked closely with manafort, who was dismissed from trump’s campaign, the newspaper reported. separately, carter page, a former foreign policy adviser to trump’s presidential campaign, told reuters via text message that he would testify before the house intelligence committee but was “still working out details.” “nothing (is) fully confirmed at this stage,” page wrote, adding that if invited, he would also testify before the senate intelligence committee, but had yet to receive such a request. abc news, which first reported on page’s planned testimony, said he would testify before the house panel on june 6. a spokesman for the committee declined comment on whether page would testify. in a letter to the panel seen by reuters, page accused brennan of offering a “biased viewpoint” in tuesday’s testimony. on wednesday morning, the top democrat on the committee said it would subpoena flynn in its probe into alleged russian meddling in the presidential election after he declined to appear before the panel. “we will be following up with subpoenas, and those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” representative adam schiff told journalists at a breakfast sponsored by the christian science monitor. the leaders of the u.s. senate intelligence committee said on tuesday they would subpoena two of flynn’s businesses after he declined to hand over documents in its separate russia probe. flynn, a retired general, is a key witness in the russia investigations because of his ties to moscow.  he was fired from his position at the white house in february, after less than a month on the job, for failing to disclose the content of talks with sergei kislyak, russia’s ambassador to the united states, and misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations.

" u.s. vice president mike pence warned north korea on monday that recent american military strikes in syria and afghanistan showed president donald trump’s resolve should not be questioned, but pyongyang vowed to continue missile and nuclear tests. after a huge display of missiles in pyongyang and a failed north korean missile test during the weekend, u.s. officials praised china for stepping up efforts to rein in north korea, beijing’s neighbor and ally. but pence and south korea’s acting president, hwang kyo ahn, said they would proceed with the early deployment to south korea of the u.s. thaad missile defense system, in spite of chinese objections. at a white house easter celebration on monday, trump was asked if he had a message for north korean leader kim jong un, and replied: “gotta behave.” but senior north korean officials remained defiant. north korea’s deputy representative to the united nations, kim in ryong, accused washington of creating “a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time” and said pyongyang’s next nuclear test would take place “at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary.” (graphic   carl vinson strike group: tmsnrt.rs/2pqomwa) (graphic   north korea's nuclear program: tmsnrt.rs/2n0gd92) north korea’s vice foreign minister han song ryol told the bbc that missiles would continue to be tested on “a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.”  kim song gyong, director general of the european department of north korea’s foreign ministry, told reuters in pyongyang that if washington made “the slightest movement” to make a nuclear strike on north korea, pyongyang would strike first and “destroy the aggressors without any mercy.” he went on to clarify that the approach of a u.s. naval strike force led by the nuclear powered aircraft carrier carl vinson to korean waters would not be considered enough to constitute “the slightest movement”. korean tensions have escalated following repeated north korean missile tests and concerns that pyongyang may soon conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test in defiance of u.n. sanctions. washington is increasingly worried about north korean efforts to develop a nuclear tipped missile that could hit the u.s. mainland. speaking alongside hwang, pence said the world had witnessed trump’s resolve in the past two weeks, which saw a u.s. missile attack on a syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non nuclear bomb on islamic state in afghanistan. “north korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the united states in this region,” pence said on what was his first stop of a four nation asia tour intended to show that trump is not turning his back on the increasingly volatile part of the world. pence, whose father served in the 1950 53 korean war, visited the north south border on monday and said washington would stand by its “ironclad alliance” with south korea. “all options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country,” he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the north korean side of the so called demilitarized zone (dmz). the trump administration has said that military action remains an option for dealing with north korea. but mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in south korea and japan and among u.s. troops there, u.s. officials say the trump administration’s main focus is on tougher economic sanctions to try to get pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs.    trump himself, when asked on monday if he was considering military action, told fox news channel he didn’t want to “telegraph” his plans like the previous administration. “we’ll see what happens. i hope things work out well,” he said but added that the united states had tried to engage the north koreans in talks for a long time.  on sunday, trump’s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, said that the united states, its allies and china were working on a range of responses to north korea’s latest missile test, citing what he called an international consensus to act. he indicated trump was not considering military action for now, despite the dispatch the carrier group. u.s. officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, a global ban on north korea’s airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing chinese banks doing business with pyongyang. they say greater chinese cooperation is vital.  white house spokesman sean spicer said china had taken some “very helpful” steps, although it remained to be seen how effective these would be. asked if trump had a “red line” on north korea, spicer said the president did not believe these worked.  susan thornton, acting u.s. assistant secretary of state for east asia, said secretary of state rex tillerson and china’s top diplomat, state councilor yang jiechi, agreed in a phone call on sunday on the need for strict enforcement of u.n. resolutions and for international action to press pyongyang “to cease provocative actions and recommit to peaceful denuclearization.” thornton said any new north korean nuclear test “would draw a pretty significant international response.” “we’re definitely not seeking conflict or regime change,” she said. “but we are committed to defending our people and our allies should it be necessary.” pence is expected to discuss korean tensions with japanese prime minister shinzo abe on tuesday when he travels to tokyo for economic talks with finance minister taro aso. he will also visit jakarta and sydney. his economic discussions will be closely watched to see how hard a line washington is prepared to take on trade. trump campaigned on an “america first” platform, and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations like china and japan. but trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues, saying he would cut a better trade deal with china if it exerts influence on north korea. china has appeared increasingly frustrated with pyongyang, speaking out against its weapons tests and supporting united nations sanctions, while repeatedly calling for talks. china banned imports of north korean coal, the country’s most important export, in february, and chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the north. however, beijing says the crisis is one between the united states and north korea.  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said the situation was “highly sensitive, complicated and high risk” and all sides should “avoid taking provocative actions “ ",0
" a series of controversial remarks by u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump show that the world should be concerned if he is elected president, a spokeswoman for german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said on wednesday. trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has courted controversy with a string of inflammatory statements about women, mexicans, muslims and war veterans, among others. steinmeier, unlike chancellor angela merkel who has said she will not comment on the u.s. election, is not neutral on the issue because he believes it is important to draw attention to the dangers posed by trump, said spokeswoman sawsan chebli. “he is indeed not neutral on this question because he thinks that if you follow what trump is saying then you need to be really anxious about what could become of this world ... if (he) does in fact become president,” chebli told a regular government news conference. steinmeier is from the centre left social democrats, the junior partner in merkel’s conservative led ruling coalition. a spokeswoman for merkel said the chancellor did not wish to interfere in the u.s. election campaign. on monday 50 prominent republican national security officials, including a former cia director, described trump as unqualified to lead the country and said he would be “the most reckless president in american history”.  trump is currently in the firing line after suggesting on tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop democratic rival hillary clinton from nominating liberal u.s. supreme court justices.

" seattle mayor ed murray, who has been accused by four men of sexually abusing them as teenagers, dropped his bid for re election on tuesday, saying that the scandal would be a distraction from more important issues. in a news conference at a waterfront park near his childhood home, an emotional murray denied the claims against him, which he has called politically motivated, according to a video posted on the mayor’s facebook page. murray, a democrat and the city’s first openly gay mayor, also suggested that the accusations were rooted in stereotypes of gay men. “the mayor’s race must be focused on... issues, not on a scandal, which it would be focused on if i were to remain in this race,” murray, who became mayor in 2014, said in announcing his withdrawal from the race. as a senator in the washington state legislature, murray championed gay rights and legalizing same sex marriage. during his term as mayor, seattle sued president donald trump over his executive order cracking down on sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.     a primary election for mayor will take place aug. 1 and the two candidates with the most votes will face off in the nov. 7 general election.     in april, a 46 year old man sued murray, claiming that the mayor paid him for sex when he was a homeless, drug addicted teenager in the 1980s, according to the lawsuit.     the seattle times newspaper said that in 2008 two other men had accused murray of abusing them when they were teenagers in the 1980s. murray has denied those claims, which did not become public until last month. a fourth accuser in a sworn court declaration made similar allegations against murray, according to the seattle times. murray consistently denied the claims, calling the accusations politically motivated, but also garnered criticism for questioning the trustworthiness of the accusers, which the seattle times said had criminal records. an attorney for the first accuser, lincoln beauregard, said on twitter that his client saw the mayor’s withdrawal from the race as “one step towards justice.” ",0

" romania s ruling social democrats have filed a slew of new changes to the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, including some abuse of office crimes, their second attempt this year to weaken a crackdown on corruption. transparency international ranks romania as one of the european union s most corrupt states and brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring, although it has praised magistrates for their efforts to root out high level graft. a draft bill released on tuesday showed a group of social democrat lawmakers are proposing that abuse of office offences that cause financial damage of less than 200,000 euros ($237,100) should no longer be punishable. other changes include serving prison sentences of less than three years at home, lower sentences for bribe taking and other graft crimes, as well as decriminalizing taking a bribe for someone other than the accused. another proposal would make using one s position to obtain sexual favors no longer a crime.  if approved, the changes would put an end to an ongoing trial of social democrat party leader and lower house speaker liviu dragnea, who is accused of abuse of office.  dozens of lawmakers and mayors across all parties stand to benefit from the changes. romania s anti corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006.  a similar attempt to decriminalize some abuse of office crimes triggered the country s largest street protests in decades at the start of 2017. the ruling coalition backed down at the time but has revived the proposals. earlier this month, the ruling coalition has used its overwhelming parliament majority to approve a judicial overhaul that puts magistrates under political control. they have also filed a different set of proposals to change the criminal code that could derail law and order. thousands of magistrates, centrist president klaus iohannis, the european commission, the u.s. state department and seven eu states have all criticized both the approved bills and the criminal code proposals. the social democrats and their junior coalition partner alde have denied the changes would affect the independence of the judiciary and have stressed that parliament has the right to legislate however it sees fit. the proposed changes place romania alongside its eastern european peers hungary and poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying eu concerns over the rule of law.

" the head of the environmental protection agency (epa) toured his first hazardous waste site on tuesday amid proposed budget cuts that could devastate efforts to clean up contaminated land and water around the country.  scott pruitt’s visit to east chicago, indiana, came a day after the agency denied a report that it was considering closing its chicago office, which oversees regional environmental protection efforts, including the flint, michigan drinking water clean up and great lakes restoration. “the reason i’m here is because it is important that we restore confidence to the people here in this community that we are going to get it right going forward,” pruitt told the media after meeting with residents and lawmakers.  pruitt did not address the report of the possible office closure or how drastic budget cuts would impact the epa’s operations. he toured a housing complex built on the superfund site where around 1,000 residents had to leave their homes earlier this year due to lead contamination. dozens of people held signs on wednesday urging the epa to continue clean up efforts.     the superfund program was started in 1980 to clean up hazardous waste sites, which now number just over 1,300 around the country.  the white house budget proposal submitted to congress last month includes a 31 percent cut in spending for the epa, including a similar reduction of the agency’s hazardous substance superfund account by $330 million to $762 million. clean up would continue in east chicago, lawmakers said.  pruitt, “made commitments that we would have it right,” democratic senator joe donnelly said.” there is a budget that is sent over and then there is a real budget that is put together. and the real budget will provide the funds necessary to make sure east chicago is right.”  east chicago, around 25 miles (40 km) outside of chicago, was home to the now defunct u.s. smelter and lead refinery inc which contaminated the facility and surrounding areas with lead and arsenic. demetra turner, 44, a resident of the west calumet housing complex who has yet to leave, urged others to keep pressure on the epa.  “keep fighting people, keep fighting, because that is what it takes,” she said.

" the u.s. senate judiciary committee voted on tuesday to confirm senator jeff sessions as attorney general of the united states, sending president donald trump’s pick to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer to the full senate for a final vote. the role got a higher profile on monday night when the republican president promptly fired acting attorney general sally yates for refusing to enforce his executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries from entering the united states. yates was a holdover from the obama administration. sessions, a 70 year old senator from alabama and a close trump ally since the early days of his presidential campaign, was likely to support the executive order. one of his former staffers, stephen miller, helped shape the document from the white house. sessions’ allegiance to trump, his hard line immigration positions and civil rights record came under scrutiny during his 10 1/2 hour hearing before the committee on jan. 10.  trump’s justice department is likely to operate in sharp contrast to the agency under obama. civil rights groups say the choices trump has made in his appointments to leadership roles at the department show that the agency is preparing to neglect or even weaken civil rights protections. hours after trump’s inauguration, the administration appointed thomas wheeler and john gore to serve as interim leaders in the department’s civil rights division. wheeler, the current acting head of the division, defended in private practice a school that confiscated a student’s breast cancer awareness bracelet for being “inappropriate;” a public school that held a christmas show in which bible excerpts were read and religious songs were sung; and the walgreens drugstore chain in a case in which a pharmacist looked up the birth control records of a customer and shared them with the customer’s ex boyfriend. gore, who will serve as deputy assistant attorney general in charge of voting rights and employment litigation, helped defend state election redistricting plans that were challenged on grounds that they violated the voting rights act.

" ramush haradinaj, a former guerrilla fighter who has twice stood trial for war crimes, was chosen on thursday to form a new government in kosovo, ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on june 11. president hashim thaci gave haradinaj the mandate after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party that paved the way for them to take power. haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought serbian forces in 1998 and 1999. that campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him, but he was acquitted twice by a united nations war crimes tribunal. the coalition signed an agreement on monday with the smaller new alliance for kosovo (akr) party to put together a new government, an agreement that gives them 62 seats in the 120 seat parliament [nl8n1l42qo. the akr is led by behgjet pacolli, whom media call the richest man in kosovo.  haradinaj is expected to present his program to parliament on saturday, after which the government should be elected.   the new government will confront unemployment running at 30 percent and uncertain relations with kosovo s neighbors, especially serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in their efforts to join the european union. it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two year counter insurgency.

" the supreme court on tuesday refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the u.s. constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment filed by a louisiana man convicted of fatally shooting his pregnant former girlfriend. two of the eight justices, liberals stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg, said they would have accepted the case, repeating concerns about the death penalty’s constitutionality they raised in a different case last year. the justices, who have sharply disagreed among themselves over capital punishment, declined to consider the appeal brought by lamondre tucker, who was sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of 18 year old tavia sills in shreveport. sills, nearly five months pregnant, was shot three times and her body was dumped in a pond. tucker, who is black, had argued in part that black males had an increased likelihood of being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in louisiana’s caddo parish due to endemic racism. at the time of tucker’s conviction, a confederate flag, symbol of the pro slavery southern states that lost the u.s. civil war that ended in 1865, flew outside the county courthouse, his lawyers said in court filings. breyer wrote that tucker “may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely geography.” “one could reasonably believe that if tucker had committed the same crime just across the red river in, say, bossier parish, he would not now be on death row,” breyer said. breyer’s comments echoed similar remarks he made in june 2015 when the court upheld oklahoma’s lethal injection procedures.  the shorthanded court has steered clear of taking major cases since the february death of justice antonin scalia, but even at full strength may not have accepted this one. there is no indication the court is any closer to taking a case that would challenge the death penalty directly, with the court’s two other liberals, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, not joining breyer’s opinion. four votes are needed for the justices to hear a case.  the pregnant sills had told tucker she believed he was the father. later testing showed tucker, 18 at the time of the murder, was not the father. the fetus did not survive. the supreme court left in place a september 2015 louisiana supreme court ruling that rejected tucker’s legal arguments and upheld his conviction and death sentence. in the united states, 31 states have the death penalty and 19 do not.

" president barack obama will ensure that federal officials are held accountable if any wrongdoing is uncovered in the u.s. environmental protection agency’s handling of the water contamination crisis in flint, michigan, the white house said on thursday. “the president believes that the principle of accountability is important, particularly when the stakes are this high,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters at a briefing.  noting that the justice department was investigating the contamination of flint’s water supply, earnest said obama will make sure that epa officials are held responsible for any “errors or wrongdoing” that may be uncovered. obama on wednesday said it was “inexplicable and inexcusable” that families in flint were not immediately notified about the contaminated water. federal and local government agencies have faced criticism for their response to the crisis in flint, where a switch in water supply for the cash strapped city of 100,000 north of detroit led to elevated levels of lead in drinking water. high levels of lead in the blood can cause brain damage and other health problems.  while the obama administration has repeatedly stressed oversight of the flint’s water was primarily the responsibility of state and local authorities, the epa has said it did not act fast enough to address the problem. complaints about flint’s water began within a month after the city switched to flint river water in april 2014 to save money. the city had been using the lake huron as its water source.  flint did not return to the lake huron water supply until october 2015, after tests showed elevated levels of lead in flint tap water and in some children.

" if the republicans’ plan to dismantle most of obamacare is approved later this month by the u.s. house of representatives, where it cleared initial hurdles last week, it would go next to the senate, where its fate is uncertain. at least nine republican senators have expressed concerns about the plan, which is moving forward in the house without a clear assessment of its impact on the federal budget or how it would impact the level of health insurance among americans. the plan would roll back much of former democratic president barack obama’s 2010 affordable care act, retain some parts of it and substitute other new parts. democrats say it goes too far. some republican conservatives say it doesn’t go far enough. republicans dominate the house, but have only 52 seats in the 100 seat senate. supporters of the republican plan would need only a simple majority to pass it, under current plans. here are some republican senators who have raised questions about the house plan, or outright opposed it: senator rand paul of kentucky: he has called the plan “obamacare lite,” saying it stops short of full repeal. he has reintroduced a bill to repeal obamacare that was approved by republicans a little over a year ago, but was vetoed by obama. senator ted cruz of texas: cruz reportedly said on march 8 that he had “significant concerns” about the plan and that it could pass the senate in its current form. but he added he would work hard to improve it. that night, he and his family dined at the white house with republican president donald trump, who has expressed support for the house plan. senator mike lee of utah: he said on march 7 the plan was a “step in the wrong direction” and expressed concern that it was not known how much it would cost and whether it would make health care more affordable. senator tom cotton of arkansas: on march 9 he urged the house to pull back, saying the plan could not pass the senate without changes. senator susan collins of maine: she has concerns about the house bill. she voted against repealing obamacare a little over a year ago because it would have taken federal funds from women’s healthcare provider planned parenthood, which also provides abortion services. the current house bill would strip funds from planned parenthood. senator rob portman of ohio: he and three other senators raised concerns in a letter last week about a feb. 10 draft of the house plan, saying they wanted to be sure it will protect people enrolled in obamacare’s medicaid expansion. senator cory gardner of colorado: he signed the letter of concern about the plan. in a march 9 telephone town hall, gardner reportedly did not say whether the current house bill met his standards on medicaid. senator lisa murkowski of alaska: she also signed the letter of concern about the plan’s effect on medicaid. senator shelley moore capito of west virginia: she, too, signed the letter of concern about the medicaid impact.

" u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump said as many as 70 percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated if he is elected in november, just hours after an adviser said the candidate would seek to cut 10 percent.     trump, who blamed regulations for stifling business, told a crowd at a town hall event in new hampshire on thursday night that regulations for the environment and safety would remain.  “we are cutting the regulation at a tremendous clip. i would say 70 percent of regulations can go,” trump said. “it’s just stopping businesses from growing.” earlier in the day during an online discussion with reuters, trump campaign adviser anthony scaramucci, a wall street financier who has raised campaign money for trump, said trump would eliminate 10 percent of regulations. “we need regulation but immediately every agency will be asked to rate the importance of their regulations and we will push to remove 10 percent of the least important,” he said.     another trump campaign adviser reached by reuters confirmed the 10 percent regulatory cut was part of their economic plan.  jeff holmstead, a former assistant administrator for the environmental protection agency under george w. bush’s presidency, said the goal was hard to comprehend. “you could reduce the number of regulations by 10 percent without accomplishing very much,” he said. he added it would make more sense for trump to try to reduce the cost of regulatory compliance by 10 percent. “i think it probably would be possible for a new administration to make changes that would reduce the cost of these programs by at least 10 percent while still maintaining essentially the same level of environmental protection,” he said. officials at the epa and the u.s. department of the interior declined to comment, citing internal policies. scaramucci also said that trump, a fierce critic of the federal reserve, would probably get along well with fed chair janet yellen.  trump has repeatedly accused the fed of serving as a political arm of the obama white house. he says yellen has put off raising interest rates in order to let president barack obama end his term in january without the economic shock that a rise in interest rates might entail. scaramucci, a founder of skybridge capital, joined reuters global markets forum to discuss his views of the campaign. he said trump would strive for a better balance in federal regulations.     scaramucci was not as dismissive of yellen as trump is, saying he believes the new york property developer would warm to her eventually. “there are many well qualified candidates but i think mr. trump has to spend some time with chairwoman yellen. i think knowing what i know about his personality he will like her,” he said. trump would seek to streamline regulations as a way to generate economic growth and help the flow of capital, the adviser said. trump has specifically singled out the energy industry as an area that he would look at for reducing regulations. “wall street is not the devil,” said scaramucci. “in fact we are at our best when (there) is harmony between main street and wall street and we hope to restore that.” scaramucci singled out several areas that trump would look to for reforms: —labor department rules expanding the fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products would likely be stopped. —legislation similar to the former glass steagall act that limited the banking industry would be on the table for review. — the dodd frank banking reforms that emerged from the great recession of 2008 09 will be reviewed and “the worst anti business parts of it will be gutted.” — the volcker rule will be adjusted. named after former federal reserve chairman paul volcker, it is part of the sweeping 2010 dodd frank financial reform law. it aims to reduce risk taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets.      ",0
" the european union expressed serious concern on wednesday after u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, saying it could have repercussions for peace prospects.  the aspirations of both parties must be fulfilled and a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of jerusalem as the future capital of both states,  eu foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said in a statement. trump reversed decades of u.s. policy by recognizing jerusalem as the israeli capital and saying washington would begin the process of moving its embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv.

" south korean and japanese jets joined exercises with two  supersonic u.s. b 1b bombers above and near the korean peninsula on thursday, two days after north korea sharply raised tension by firing a missile over japan. the drills, involving four u.s. stealth f 35b jets as well as south korean and japanese fighter jets, came at the end of annual u.s. south korea military exercises focused mainly on computer simulations.  north korea s actions are a threat to our allies, partners and homeland, and their destabilizing actions will be met accordingly,  said general terrence j. o shaughnessy, pacific air forces commander, who made an unscheduled visit to japan.  this complex mission clearly demonstrates our solidarity with our allies and underscores the broadening cooperation to defend against this common regional threat.  north korea has been working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states and has recently threatened to land missiles near the u.s. pacific territory of guam. on monday, north korea, which sees the exercises as preparations for invasion, raised the stakes in its stand off with the united states and its allies by firing an intermediate range missile over japan. on thursday, its official news agency, kcna, denounced the military drills in traditionally robust fashion, calling them  the rash act of those taken aback  by the missile test, which it described as  the first military operation in the pacific.  president donald trump, who has warned that the u.s. military is  locked and loaded  in case of north korean provocation, reacted angrily to the latest missile test, declaring on twitter that  talking is not the answer  to resolving the crisis over north korea s weapons programs. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis was quick on wednesday to stress that a diplomatic solution remained possible, but on thursday he told reporters he agreed with trump that washington  should not be talking right now to a nation that is firing missiles over the top of japan, an ally.  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders reiterated at a regular briefing on thursday that all options   diplomatic, economic and military   remained on the table. japanese defence minister itsunori onodera spoke to mattis by telephone and agreed to keep putting pressure on north korea in a  visible  form, japan s defense ministry said. japanese prime shinzo abe said he and visiting british prime minister theresa may agreed to urge china, north korea s lone major ally,  to do more to rein in north korea. may and abe also discussed the possibility of adopting a new u.n. security council resolution on north korea, a british government source said. the 15 member u.n. security council on tuesday condemned the firing of the missile over japan as  outrageous  and demanded that north korea halt its weapons programs. but the u.s. drafted statement did not threaten new sanctions. japan has been urging washington to propose new security council sanctions, which diplomats said could target north korean laborers working abroad, oil supplies and textile exports. however, diplomats expect resistance from russia and fellow veto wielding power china, particularly given that new measures were only announced on aug. 5 after north korea tested its first two intercontinental ballistic missiles in july.  a u.s. ban on travel by americans to north korea comes into effect on friday, a step announced after the death of a u.s. student shortly after his release from a 15 year prison sentence in the country, where three other americans are still detained. china repeated a call on thursday for restraint by all parties. defence ministry spokesman ren guoqiang told a monthly briefing china would never allow war or chaos on the korean peninsula, its doorstep, and military means were not an option.  china strongly demands all sides to exercise restraint and remain calm and not do anything to worsen tensions,  ren said, adding that chinese forces were maintaining a normal state of alert along the north korean border. chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the situation on the peninsula was serious.  the current tense situation on the peninsula isn t a screenplay or a video game,  she told reporters.  it s real, and is an immense and serious issue that directly involves the safety of people from both the north and south of the peninsula, as well as peace and stability of the entire region.  for an interactive on north korea's missile capabilities, click: here for a graphic on north korean missile trajectories, ranges, click: here for a graphic on kim's new act of defiance, click: here ",0
" australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull, a strong supporter of gay marriage, defended the right of a church to refuse to marry a young couple who had posted support for same sex unions on social media.  the minister of a presbyterian church in the southern state of victoria told a young couple in their 20s that they would not be allowed to hold their ceremony at the church after the bride posted a message on facebook supporting same sex marriage.  australia is in the midst of a non compulsory, non binding poll to inform parliament on whether it should become the 25th country to legalise same sex marriage. the issue has threatened to fracture the ruling liberal national coalition government.   churches are free to marry whoever they like,  turnbull said on friday in canberra according to a press conference transcript.  as strongly as i believe in the right of same sex couples to marry ... religious freedom is fundamental and it will be protected in any bill that emerges from this parliament.   religious freedom in australia is guaranteed under the constitution. the issue has dogged prime minister turnbull for two years as progressive and conservative members of his ruling coalition have pulled in opposite directions threatening his narrow parliamentary majority.   australians have started receiving postal ballots for the poll, which runs until the end of october, and the issue is dividing the country s population of 24 million people along religious and generational lines. despite securing 70 percent public support in an ipsos/fairfax poll, the issue of same sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the high court gave the all clear for the vote.  fissures have opened within religions as some churches urge their followers to vote against same sex marriage, while other churches have taken a neutral stance.  the catholic archbishop of sydney, australia s largest city, wrote to sydney catholic school principals on friday afternoon, quoting pope francis and urging them to oppose the vote. the bishop of parramatta, vincent long van nguyen, however, told his parishioners in a pastoral letter that the vote was a matter of individual conscience.  the anglican church, which officially opposes gay marriage, has been divided on the issue for years.

" the united states sent four detainees from the guantanamo bay military prison to the united arab emirates and saudi arabia on thursday, marking president barack obama’s final prisoner transfers from a facility whose continued existence he said would be judged harshly by history. with republican donald trump to be sworn in as president on friday and vowing to keep the prison open, democrat obama whittled down the inmate population there to only 41, far short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail dating back to his 2008 presidential campaign. in a parting shot on an issue seen tarnishing his legacy, obama said u.s. lawmakers who have thwarted his efforts to shut the prison at the u.s. naval base in cuba “have abdicated their responsibility to the american people.” “history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to bring it to a responsible end,” he said in a letter to the republican controlled congress. “once again, i encourage the congress to close the facility.” margaret huang, executive director of amnesty international usa, said: “we are extremely concerned that president elect trump will make good on his threat to subject more people to indefinite detention without charge or trial.” the offshore prison was opened by obama’s predecessor george w. bush to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks. under bush, it came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. the latest transfers included three detainees sent to the uae, including the last russian held at the prison, and an afghan and a yemeni, u.s. officials said. a saudi prisoner was sent home. it marked the completion of obama’s final flurry of releases. trump said during the election campaign that he not only wants to keep the prison open but “load it up with some bad dudes.” obama pressed ahead, however, moving out most of the prisoners on a list of low level detainees deemed by parole style inter agency reviews to be safe for transfer. there were 242 prisoners when he took office. his efforts were blocked by mostly republican opposition in congress, which barred him from moving prisoners to the u.s. mainland. pentagon foot dragging has also been blamed. obama lamented that his opponents had “placed politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies and the threat posed to u.s. national security.” trump said this month that all those held at guantanamo should stay. “these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield,” he tweeted. however, the obama administration has insisted that intelligence shows only a very small percentage of the prisoners it has released have returned to militant activities. among the three sent to the uae was ravil mingazov, reported to be an ethnic tatar and russian army veteran captured in pakistan in 2002. also sent to uae were haji wali muhammed and yassim qasim mohammed ismail qasim, while jabran al qahtani was flown to saudi arabia, the pentagon said. of the prisoners left at guantanamo, 10 face charges in military commissions, including people accused of plotting the sept. 11 attacks. about two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release. a handful of inmates previously cleared for transfer will remain after the administration was unable to make arrangements in time for relocation. lawyers for two of those detainees, an algerian and a moroccan, mounted last ditch court challenges seeking their repatriation but the justice department objected.

" the u.s. senate voted almost unanimously on tuesday to confirm south carolina governor nikki haley as ambassador to the united nations, sending a rising republican star to represent president donald trump at an institution he has criticized. haley was backed by 96 senators, with only four opposed. she impressed lawmakers during her confirmation hearing this month. haley, 45, promised to press for u.n. reforms but also fight for human rights and support international institutions, often breaking from trump’s positions. “american values that we all hold dear and want to promote around the world are things that she has the ability to communicate and cares deeply about,” said senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker. the “no” votes came from democratic senators tom udall, chris coons and martin heinrich, and senator bernie sanders, an independent who caucuses with democrats. “like many americans, and many of our allies, i am concerned about president trump’s erratic statements and positions on foreign policy, and that concern is only deepened by the fact that his nominee to be ambassador to the united nations has no real diplomatic experience,” udall said. haley has only held office in the state where she has been governor since 2011. the daughter of immigrants from india, haley attracted national attention in 2015 when she secured the removal of the confederate battle flag from south carolina’s capitol grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in charleston. she did not endorse trump during last year’s presidential primaries and has warned that some of his most inflammatory statements promoted hate. during her confirmation hearing, haley seconded criticism of the 193 nation organization by trump and many of their fellow republicans. she called for a close look at u.s. spending on the united nations and blasted what she called its bias against israel. washington provides 22 percent of the u.n. budget. the united states and its frequent rivals russia and china all hold permanent seats on the u.n. security council, along with u.s. allies britain and france. haley won plaudits at her hearing for promising to stand up to russia and agreeing that its actions, including bombing hospitals in syria, should be considered war crimes. haley was easily approved earlier on tuesday by the 21 member foreign relations committee. haley is only the fourth confirmed member of trump’s cabinet, joining defense secretary james mattis, homeland security secretary john kelly and central intelligence agency director mike pompeo. unusually, trump’s pick for secretary of state was not confirmed before his u.n. ambassador. his choice, former exxon mobil chief executive rex tillerson, faced unanimous opposition from the 10 foreign relations committee democrats after a confirmation hearing at which they said he seemed poorly prepared. the full, republican led senate is expected to confirm tillerson early next week. haley is due to be sworn in on wednesday. she is being succeeded as south carolina’s governor by republican lieutenant governor henry mcmaster.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on monday that he was working to see if there was a link between a spate of recent military accidents and budget caps, but said he could not draw a direct line at this time.  since june, more than 70 u.s. service members have either been killed or injured in training or non combat accidents, ranging from two naval collisions in asia to a marine corps transport plane crash in rural mississippi. “i am not willing to say right now that there is a direct line between sequestration and what has happened. i am willing to say ... we are going to take a very close look at that,” mattis told reporters. mattis said that he was looking at a number of broader issues to try and explain the large number of accidents, including whether there were cultural issues in the military. “we are almost hardwired to say “can do,” that is just the way we are brought up,” mattis said. “but there comes a point in peacetime where you have to make certain you are not always saying we’re going to do more with less,” he added. mattis said he was not concerned that military leaders felt pressured to say their troops were trained and ready, even if they were not.  the issue of u.s. military accidents was highlighted by a series of recent naval collisions.  a pre dawn collision between guided missile destroyer john s. mccain and a merchant vessel east of singapore and malaysia on aug. 21 killed 10 sailors and was the fourth major incident in the u.s. pacific fleet this year. in june, another destroyer, the fitzgerald, collided with a philippine cargo ship, killing seven u.s. sailors. the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations will appear before the senate armed services committee on tuesday, where they are expected to face tough questions from lawmakers on the collisions and whether enough was done to avoid them. in a sunday interview on cbs’ “face the nation” senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said recent military accidents were because of budget caps. “it’s because of a thing called sequestration, and our failure over the last eight years to make sure our military is prepared, equipped, trained,” mccain said.

" humanitarian organizations helping rohingya muslim refugees in bangladesh said on wednesday they need $434 million over the next six months to help up to 1.2 million people, most of them children, in dire need of life saving assistance. there are an estimated 809,000 rohingya sheltering in bangladesh after fleeing violence and persecution in myanmar, more than half a million of whom have arrived since aug. 25 to join 300,000 rohingya who are already there.  unless we support the efforts of the bangladesh government to provide immediate aid to the half million people who have arrived over the past month, many of the most vulnerable   women, children and the elderly   will die,  said william lacy swing, director general of the international organization for migration, which is coordinating the aid effort.  they will be the victims of neglect.   about 509,000 rohingya have arrived in bangladesh since attacks by rohingya militants in august triggered a sweeping  myanmar military offensive that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing. myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing. it says its forces are fighting insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) who claimed responsibility for attacks on about 30 police posts and an army camp on aug. 25. the insurgents were also behind similar but smaller attacks in october last year that led to a brutal myanmar army response triggering the flight of 87,000 rohingya to bangladesh. the agencies  plan for help over the next six months factors in the possibility of another 91,000 refugees arriving, as the influx continues, robert watkins, u.n. resident coordinator in bangladesh, said in a statement.  the plan targets 1.2 million people, including all rohingya refugees, and 300,000 bangladeshi host communities over the next six months,  watkins said.. half a million people need food while 100,000 emergency shelters are required. more than half the refugees are children, while 24,000 pregnant women need maternity care, the agencies said. u.n. appeals for funds to help with humanitarian crises are generally significantly under funded. the rohingya are regarded as illegal immigrants in buddhist majority myanmar and most are stateless. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi has faced scathing criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military drafted constitution. she has condemned rights abuses and said myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with bangladesh in 1993 under which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back. but many rohingya are pessimistic about their chances of going home, partly because few have official papers confirming their residency. most are also wary about returning without an assurance of  citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and discrimination they have endured for years. the rights group amnesty international said the international community had to ensure that no refugees are forced back to myanmar as long as they remain at risk of serious rights violations. the u.n. refugee agency says any repatriation has to be voluntary. human rights watch said it had found evidence that the myanmar military had summarily executed dozens of rohingya in a village called maung nu in rakhine state, on aug. 27, two days after the insurgent attacks triggered the violence. the rights group said it had spoken to 14 survivors and witnesses who were now refugees in bangladesh. they described how soldiers entered a compound where people had gathered in fear of military retaliation.  they took several dozen rohingya men and boys into the courtyard and then shot or stabbed them to death. others were killed as they tried to flee,  said the rights group, which has accused myanmar of crimes against humanity. spokesmen for the government, the military and police did not answer their telephones and were not available for comment. wednesday is a holiday in myanmar. reuters was not able to independently verify the report. the u.n. committees for women s and children s rights called on myanmar to immediately stop violence in rakhine, saying violations  being committed at the behest of the military and other security forces  may amount to crimes against humanity.

" u.s. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said on friday the clinton foundation was seeking other organizations to  partner with as it looks to wind down some of its charitable work, but defended her work as secretary of state as independent from her family’s foundation. clinton has come under fire in recent days amid questions over the charity and its donors given her role heading the state department from 2009 to early 2013. critics have accused her of running a “pay for play” operation, a charge she and the foundation have denied. even some supporters have said clinton faces a perception problem over the issue.  “i know the foundation is looking for partners, but that’s going to take some time to carry out,” clinton said in an interview on msnbc. “winding down some of these programs takes time. you don’t just turn on and off ... a switch. even trying to negotiate with partner groups takes a lot of serious effort.”  “my work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. i made policy decisions based on what i thought was right to keep americans safe and to protect our interests abroad. i believe my aides also acted appropriately,” she said.  several media editorial boards this week noted the foundation’s philanthropic efforts in areas such as global health and hiv/aids, but urged the foundation   formally called the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation   to transfer the work to other large u.s. charities. former president bill clinton, who helped establish the global charity after serving two terms in the white house, would resign from the board if his wife wins the nov. 8  election, the foundation announced last week. it also said it would stop accepting some foreign and corporate donations. hillary clinton’s republican rival for the white house, donald trump, and other republicans have called for a special prosecutor to probe the charity for possible corruption, an accusation her campaign has called a groundless political smear.

" russian president vladimir putin held talks with egypt s president abdel fattah al sisi on monday, agreeing to resume civilian flights which moscow halted more than two years ago after militants bombed a russian tourist jet over the sinai. putin s latest visit to cairo reflects the deepening ties between russia and egypt, the second largest recipient of u.s. military aid after israel and a strategic u.s. partner in the middle east because of its control of the suez canal. putin, who flew on to turkey, briefly visited a russian base in syria before arriving in egypt and ordered russian forces to start withdrawing from syria after a two year military campaign there. in cairo, egyptian and russian ministers signed a $21 billion deal to start work on egypt s dabaa nuclear power plant and putin said moscow was ready to resume russian civilian flights to egypt. moscow halted civilian air traffic to egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a russian metrojet flight, downing the jet leaving from the tourist resort of sharm el sheikh and killing 224 people on board. the attack and moscow s decision damaged egypt s already struggling tourism industry. egyptian airport inspections and talks to resume flights have been going on for months.  the russian security services have reported to me that, on the whole, we are ready for opening the direct air link between moscow and cairo,  putin said.  this would require signing a corresponding intergovernmental protocol.  russia s transport minister told reporters flights could resume in early february, and russia was prepared to sign a protocol with egypt this week. earlier, russian state nuclear company rosatom said the dabaa nuclear station it will build in egypt will have four reactors and cost up to $21 billion. construction is expected to finish in 2028 2029. moscow and cairo signed an initial agreement in 2015 for russia to build the plant, with russia extending a loan to egypt to cover the cost of construction. sisi said the two leaders had also discussed industrial projects, trade and russian investments in egypt, including in the suez canal economic zone. sisi and putin also discussed syria and mutual rejection of u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel, a move that has triggered protests across the region and from european capitals.  we had a detailed exchange of views on key international issues. our approaches either coincide completely or are really quite close,  putin said.  the high level russian visit comes after the u.s. government in august decided to deny egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay another $195 million because of its failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms. russia launched a military operation to support syrian president bashar al assad in september 2015, and there are signs moscow is keen to expand its military presence in the region. neither leader on monday mentioned an announcement from november when russia s government published a draft agreement between russia and egypt allowing both countries to use each other s air space and air bases for their military planes. but putin has been steadily building relations with egypt. on his first visit to cairo in 2015, he was the first leader of a major power to meet with sisi after the former egyptian army commander ousted islamist president mohamed mursi in 2013. that prompted washington to cool relations with egypt, and the u.s. government suspended some military aid. since then the two leaders have increased cooperation, reviving the historical alliance between egypt and soviet union of the 1970s.

"peace through strength president donald trump raised the stakes with iran again this morning by dashing off a tweet.the tweet comes a day after the new president dramatically raised the possibility of military action against iran over its missiles test on thursday saying  nothing is off the table  amid news that a new round of sanctions could be coming within hours. sources told the associated press that up to two dozen iranian individuals, companies and possibly government agencies could be penalized as part of the move.action could come as early as later friday, said the officials and others with knowledge of the decision. the individuals weren t authorized to discuss the unannounced sanctions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.gen. michael flynn told reporters during a white house press briefing that the administration  condemns such actions by iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the middle east that puts american lives at risk.   as of today, we are officially putting iran on notice,  he said.trump used the phrase when asked directly if military action was possible, and after a series of angry tweets about how the islamic republic tested a ballistic missile   something the nuclear bargain it struck with barack obama explicitly forbids. it also emerged thursday that iran has tested a cruise missile called  sumar  that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. the development was reported by german newspaper die welt reported thursday, citing unspecified intelligence sources.trump s personal involvement began earl on thursday morning when he used social media to issue an explicit warning to tehran.trump has been openly hostile to the terms of the obama-tehran nuclear deal, saying during his presidential campaign that it was  stupid,   a disgrace,  and  the worst deal ever negotiated.  his tweets likely stand as the first time a head of state has used social media to threaten a foreign country. they were met with contempt by the iranian regime.a top adviser to the iranian supreme leader said the country will not yield to  useless  us threats from  an inexperienced person  over its ballistic missile program.ali akbar velayati said, who is a senior counsel to iran s most powerful man ayatollah ali khamenei hit back. this is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened iran,  he said. the american government will understand that threatening iran is useless. the report of a cruise missile test in the german newspaper said the sumar cruise missile was built in iran and traveled around 375 miles in its first known successful test.the missile is believed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons and may have a range of 1,200 to 1,800 miles, the paper said, citing intelligence sources.cruise missiles are harder to counter than ballistic missiles since they fly at lower altitudes and can evade enemy radar, confounding missile defense missiles and hitting targets deep inside an opponent s territory.but the biggest advantage from iran s point of view, a security expert told die welt, was that cruise missiles are not mentioned in any united nations resolutions that ban work on ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.there has been no explicit response from iran or from washington on the cruise missile disclosure.however, trump s national security advisor had issued his own stern warning to tehran s mullahs on wednesday.  daily mail ",1

" the white house said on monday that the obama administration “strongly opposes” passage by the house of representatives a bill on mergers and acquisitions, saying it harms a federal agency’s ability to promote competition and protect consumers.  proposed changes to the standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act of 2015, sponsored by representative blake farenthold, a texas republican, “threaten to undermine the (federal trade commission’s) important role in protecting competition and consumers,” the white house said in a statement.

" the internal watchdog at the u.s. justice department said on wednesday he hopes to complete his review by early spring into whether the federal bureau of investigation erred when it announced it was reopening its investigation into democratic candidate hillary clinton’s emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. “we have interviewed dozens of people. we are not at the 100 level yet, but we’re in the dozens range. we’ve reviewed about 1.2 million records in the course of the investigation,” justice department inspector general michael horowitz said, in testimony before a u.s. house of representatives panel.  “we are aiming to release the report in late winter/early spring, so hopefully in that march april time period.”  after a deluge of congressional requests, horowitz’s office earlier this year announced it would review the pre election decision making at the fbi. at the heart of the review is whether former fbi director james comey improperly made a series of public statements about the status of the bureau’s investigation into clinton’s use of a private email server for official correspondence while she was secretary of state. comey, who was fired in may by u.s. president donald trump, had also led an investigation into whether the trump campaign colluded with russia to influence the 2016 election. the fbi does not typically discuss its investigations publicly. in the case of clinton, however, comey decided in july 2016 to hold a press conference and explain why the fbi had declined to refer clinton for prosecution. he said at the time her actions were careless, but did not rise to criminal behavior. comey in october 2016 sent congress a letter saying the fbi needed to re open its investigation after it uncovered new emails on the computer of former representative anthony weiner, who had been married to one clinton’s top aides. then on nov. 6, 2016   two days before the presidential election   comey said the fbi had not uncovered any new evidence. comey’s various public disclosures stirred a lot of controversy with some questioning whether he had violated the hatch act, which bars government employees from interfering with u.s. elections.  republicans have also complained about why former u.s. attorney general loretta lynch did not recuse herself from the matter after it was revealed she had met with former president bill clinton on board a plane while the investigation was still ongoing. the issues have recently prompted a handful of committees in the republican led u.s. congress to open their own reviews into the same set of facts being probed by horowitz’s office.

" republican donald trump campaigned on a promise to shake up washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the united states handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies. yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from congress after he takes office on jan. 20. while he will may enjoy a post election honeymoon with congressional republicans, a long lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with republican orthodoxy. following is an overview of trump’s top policy plans: in his campaign, trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt u.s. workers and the country’s competitiveness. he has promised to “get tough” on china and withdraw from the 12 nation trans pacific partnership, or tpp, which is still not finalized. as president, trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as china.  president barack obama’s administration has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for tpp, saying its fate was up to trump and republican lawmakers. trump has also said he would renegotiate or scrap the north american free trade agreement, the 1994 free trade deal with mexico and canada. both canada and mexico have indicated they are willing to discuss the agreement with trump. canada has indicated it would consider a free trade agreement that excludes mexico. economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to t shirts. u.s. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.      trump has promised to build a wall along the mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been “compromised by terrorism.”  since his election, he has said parts could be a fence instead of a wall, and he would act to deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records. it was unclear where his figure comes from. think tank migration policy institute estimated in a 2015 report there were 820,000 unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.    those policies would not come cheap. trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. other estimates have run much higher. politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. while many congressional republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost. trump has said he would force mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want.  trump also promised to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” such as new york and los angeles that shield people who are in the country illegally.     more broadly, trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like republican senator jeff sessions of alabama who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. that would be a blow to business groups and hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws. trump has promised to repeal president barack obama’s signature affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. he would need congress to act, and republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100 member senate. republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of americans who previously had no healthcare. after the election trump said he would consider retaining parts of obamacare, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with existing conditions. trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of u.s. government spending. that combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan center for a responsible budget. he has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year. on taxes, he would get plenty of help from republicans in congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. but they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks. trump’s promise to protect entitlement programs such as social security and medicare will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. but those programs are popular with the american public. trump has promised a “dismantling” of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. both trump and the republican party have called for reinstating glass steagall, the 1930s era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit taking institutions. republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most despised pieces of the dodd frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to glass steagall. trump appears to be leaning toward weakening the law in a manner similar to what was proposed in a bill known as the choice act this summer by jeb hensarling, the republican chairman of the u.s. house financial services committee.      trump has offered few details about his plans to fight islamic state but has said he would “knock the hell out of” the militant group. he says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. trump said that if he won, he would give u.s. generals 30 days after taking office on jan. 20 to propose their own plans. trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in syria, and instead has said he would create “safe zones” there, which he says would be funded by gulf states. obama has said a safe zone in syria would require a large u.s. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with americans weary of lengthy wars in iraq and afghanistan. trump has said he would have a “very, very good” relationship with russia.  trump has said could work with russia to combat islamic state. he also said he would look into recognizing crimea, seized from ukraine in 2014, as russian territory and lifting sanctions on russia imposed by western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. trump has criticized the north atlantic treaty organization, saying some u.s. allies have not met their defense commitments. in july, he said if russia attacked a nato member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. nato leaders say the sanctions against russia are key to persuading it to change that country’s behavior in ukraine, where it has backed ethnic russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. with one vacancy on the supreme court and several more possible in the coming four years, trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the courts for decades to come. his list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and republicans in the u.s. senate, who will be eager to help him in that area. trump has called global warming a hoax and said he wants to cancel the 2015 paris agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on nov. 4. instead, he says he will push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil.  trump’s advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on his transition team.

" at a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful koch brothers’ network, much of the talk was about the conservative political group’s criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the u.s. senate. that opposition suggests billionaires charles and david koch, powerful players in republican politics, remain at odds at least on some key issues with president donald trump, whose campaign last year they refused to back. but beyond healthcare, the kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administration’s actions, including efforts to roll back federal regulations, the decision to pull out of the paris global climate accord, a veterans administration reform bill and the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court. koch officials say their network has better access to the trump administration than they expected given past frictions, partly because former koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs. “overall, we’ve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we haven’t been able to make in the last 10 years,” said james davis, a spokesman for freedom partners, a koch backed advocacy group. vice president mike pence has played a key role, meeting privately with charles koch on friday, as well as marc short, a former member of the koch network who is now trump’s point man in congress.  charles koch, addressing more than 400 supporters gathered at the broadmoor luxury resort in colorado for the event, touted the progress the organization is making, particularly since the 2016 election. “when i look at where we are — at the size and effectiveness of this network — i’m blown away,” he said. “i’m more optimistic now than ever.” the koch brothers have been a force in american politics since the 1980s. their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on koch industries, the second largest privately held company in the united states with annual revenues of more than $115 billion from interests in energy, chemicals and other sectors.  both trump and the koch network have incentives to build warmer ties. the kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the republican majority in congress during next year’s midterm elections. attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least $100,000 to be invited. koch funded groups such as freedom partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other trump administration agenda items. during the 2016 campaign, the kochs kept their distance from trump. charles koch spoke out against trump’s proposed muslim registry, invoking a comparison to nazi germany. the network did not actively work to defeat trump during the republican primary. but when he secured the nomination, the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing democratic candidate hillary clinton. by contrast, the koch network spent more than $120 million in the 2012 election to defeat president barack obama.     for his part, trump lumped the kochs in with other special interest groups, boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him. but the koch network began showing its clout in the spring when it worked with the white house to push the house of representatives healthcare bill in a more conservative direction.     tim phillips, president of americans for prosperity, a koch advocacy group, teamed with pence and short, trump’s legislative affairs director, to help get the measure through the house.     pence is viewed as a trusted friend of the koch network, dating to his time as a congressman.     at the meeting with charles koch on friday they discussed healthcare and tax reform, phillips and other koch aides said.      short is a former pence aide and koch alumni, having run the koch political organization that became freedom partners. stephen ford, a speechwriter for pence, has worked for freedom partners.     koch operatives were encouraged when the white house recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports, the so called “border adjustment tax” advocated by house speaker paul ryan.     americans for prosperity and freedom partners mounted a media and public pressure campaign against the border tax. phillips has met with treasury secretary steven mnuchin on the issue. mnuchin’s chief of staff, eli miller, served as the ohio director of afp.     mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of congress, representative mark meadows of north carolina said at the donor retreat.     on the veterans bill, koch group concerned veterans of america was able to work with one of their own. darin selnick, a former senior adviser to that group, is now a top aide to trump’s secretary of veterans affairs david shulkin.     that group is working with the white house on the more than 130 federal judicial vacancies trump must fill, partnering with conservative legal advocate leonard leo, who has become a trusted trump adviser on the issue.     leo joined charles koch on stage at a donor event on saturday night. a koch group,  concerned veterans of america, mounted a grassroots campaign to secure neil gorsuch’s confirmation to the supreme court.     yet some stark policy differences remain between the kochs and the trump administration.     the kochs, who are proponents of criminal justice reform, are frustrated with the department of justice’s effort to crack down on low level drug offenders. they also disagree with trump’s hardline immigration stance.     asked about the koch network’s successes, a white house aide did not expressly address the network’s goals, but said trump “has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again.”     in interviews with attendees at the donor summit, opinions on trump were mixed, but even some critics found reason to praise the administration. several mentioned education secretary betsy devos, an advocate of charter schools and vouchers.     other attendees were effusive in their praise of trump’s actions so far.     “he’s walks the walk,” said al hartman, ceo of a property management firm in houston. “he’s doing exactly what everyone wants done.” ",0
" brazilian highway police on wednesday detained cesare battisti, an italian former left wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, as he was attempting to cross the border into bolivia in a taxi, federal police said. battisti was apparently trying to leave brazil after italy reportedly asked brazil s government to revoke his asylum status and extradite him to serve his prison sentence. he was stopped by highway police as he was about to cross the border in a bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a  significant  quantity of undeclared foreign currency, the federal police said in a statement.       battisti faced life in prison in italy, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerilla group called armed proletarians for communism. he escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in france before fleeing to brazil to avoid being extradited to italy. battisti s lawyer, igor sant anna, told reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that president michel temer s government could agree to italy s request. habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause. the police statement said he was being held for breaking currency rules. o globo newspaper reported last week that italy had asked the temer government to review the status of battisti, who was granted refugee status by former leftist president luis inacio lula da silva on his last day in office in 2010. lula had refused an italian extradition request, a decision that upset relations between the two countries.

"friday on msnbc, climate activist bill nye warned conservatives to  watch out,  saying progressive blue states will  address climate change  on their own.nye said,  only 40 percent of people in the u.s. think that congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups, especially from the fossil fuel industry, have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty, plus or minus two percent, is the same as plus or minus 100 percent. he continued,  there s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writ-large states rights. just watch out, conservatives, if states rights include california, illinois, new york   these places that, where people voted in a progressive fashion   watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions, either overtly or by default, on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done. then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way. he added,  we ve got to remind people that we re all in this together. the people i think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies. we want to engage everybody. not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest. it is not in the best interest, especially of your children and grandchildren. a couple of times you mentioned that i am against the president and so on. i m not especially against the president. i just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future, to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future. this is true, not just with regard to the national debt, which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved ronald reagan, not only will that national debt increase, but the climate debt, in a sense, what we have to do to address climate change, will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down.    breitbart newsthe climate change debate went nuclear last year, over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the national oceanic and atmospheric association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming  pause. in an article on the climate etc. blog, john bates, who retired last year as principal scientist of the national climatic data center, accused the lead author of the 2015 noaa  pausebuster  report of trying to  discredit  the hiatus through  flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards. in addition, mr. bates told the daily [u.k.] mail that the report s author, former noaa national centers for environmental information director thomas karl, did so by  insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation. gradually, in the months after [the report] came out, the evidence kept mounting that tom karl constantly had his  thumb on the scale    in the documentation, scientific choices, and release of datasets   in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy,  mr. bates said saturday on climate etc.the june 2015 report,  possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus,  which updated the ocean temperature record, was published six months before the u.n. s paris summit.the accusations sparked a fierce back-and-forth sunday between so-called climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of mr. bates  claim, which he defended on the climate etc. blog run by former georgia tech climatologist judith curry.zeke hausfather, berkeley earth climate scientist, said in a sunday  fact-check  on the carbonbrief blog that the karl paper s conclusions  have been validated by independent data from satellites, buoys, and argo floats and many other independent groups. while noaa s data management procedures may well need improvement, their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups,  mr. hausfather said, citing berkeley earth and the u.k. s met office hadley centre.he said the record  strongly suggests that noaa got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. meanwhile, the whistleblowing prompted a  we-told-you-so  moment from republicans on the house science, space and technology committee who have long suspected the obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 1998-2013 pause in global temperature increases. now that dr. bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within noaa about the quality and transparency of the data before publication, we know why noaa fought transparency and oversight at every turn,  said chairman lamar smith in a sunday statement.the panel launched an investigation into the noaa pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was  rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so-called clean power plan and upcoming paris climate conference. dr. bates  revelations and noaa s obstruction certainly lend credence to what i ve expected all along   that the karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored noaa s own standards for scientific study,  mr. smith said.mr. bates said he decided to come forward after reading a washington post article dec. 13 that said federal scientists are  frantically copying u.s. climate data, fearing it might vanish under trump. as a climate scientist formerly responsible for noaa s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data,  he said on climate etc.in his experience, the  most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of tom karl et al. 2015 (hereafter referred to as the karl study or k15), purporting to show no  hiatus  in global warming in the 2000s. noaa did not return immediately sunday a request for comment. the daily mail said that mr. karl  admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published  but denied trying to influence the climate summit. asked why he had not waited, he said:  john bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time. he denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for paris, saying:  there was no discussion about paris,  said the daily mail article.the american geophysical union issued a statement saying it was  very closely monitoring the situation, have considered the possible implications, and will be sharing any new information or response by agu with you here.

" president elect donald trump plans to nominate former labor secretary elaine chao to head the transportation department, a source with knowledge of the decision said on tuesday. the source, who requested anonymity, confirmed the pick to reuters. chao, the wife of republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, served as labor secretary under president george w. bush and was the first asian american woman to hold a cabinet position. the formal announcement was expected tuesday afternoon. although trump spoke on the campaign trail about wanting to “drain the swamp” in washington, more than half of trump’s nine key appointments so far have been accomplished washington insiders, such as chao. chao will face a number of big decisions at the agency that regulates the nation’s vehicles, airplanes, railroads, pipelines, ports and highways   including how to proceed on self driving cars on u.s. roads, the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, over people and whether u.s. fuel efficiency standards should be revised. there are dozens of other pending regulatory issues the next administration will face, including railroad safety and staffing rules, requiring event data recorders in all u.s. vehicles and whether to set rules for airlines requiring they give more passengers with disabilities seats with extra leg room and whether to ban or restrict phone calls made on personal phones on u.s. flights. she may also take a leading role in trump’s plans to rebuild u.s. infrastructure. trump has called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years to rebuild airports, bridges and other projects, but it is unclear how much of the funding would come from the federal budget. mitch bainwol, chief executive of the alliance of automobile manufacturers, a trade group that has urged the trump administration to conduct a sweeping review of auto regulations, praised chao as a “superb choice.” he said the next administration will make important decisions on self driving cars and how to maximize “the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy.” former u.s. house speaker newt gingrich praised chao’s expected nomination. she will be a “great secretary of transportation. she really understands the federal government can lead rebuilding our infrastructure,” he wrote on twitter. house democratic leader nancy pelosi said democrats want to work with chao on fixing infrastructure but “will not allow republicans to use an infrastructure bill as a trojan horse for undermining workers’ wages and handing massive tax breaks to big corporations.”  chao is a former deputy transportation secretary and sits on the boards of wells fargo & co (wfc.n), ingersoll rand co [ircom.ul], news corp (nwsa.o) and vulcan materials co (vmc.n). a chinese immigrant, chao arrived in the united states at age 8. her father, james s.c. chao, is founder of the foremost group, an international shipping company.

" the head of the democratic national committee on saturday vowed to ensure all candidates have an equal chance to win the democratic presidential nomination after a former party chair accused the committee of rigging the process to aid hillary clinton in 2016. dnc chairman tom perez said in a statement the 2020 nominating process would be “unquestionably fair and transparent.” perez made his comments after former dnc chairwoman donna brazile said in an opinion piece in politico earlier this week that the nomination process had been “rigged” in clinton’s favor after she signed a fundraising agreement with the dnc in 2015. clinton, a former u.s. senator and first lady, beat senator bernie sanders for the nomination but lost the election to republican donald trump in november 2016. senator elizabeth warren, a massachusetts democrat, told cnn this week that perez needed to assure democrats, including supporters of sanders, that the process was fair and she agreed that the 2016 nominating process was “rigged.” perez said he is “more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. that is unacceptable.” sanders’ campaign manager jeff weaver told cnn this week he thought the debate schedule was “rigged.” perez said the party will “decide the debate schedule in advance, instead of negotiating it after all our candidates have entered the race” and “any and all joint fundraising agreements will be transparent.” leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had actively favored clinton over sanders. former clinton campaign manager robby mook on friday denied the nomination had been rigged in clinton’s favor. “hillary clinton won this primary with almost 4 million votes,” mook told cnn. “the idea that the dnc could rig a contest frankly is laughable.” brazile, who replaced former dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz last year after a furor over the contents of the leaked emails, also wrote she contemplated proposing to replace clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, the washington post reported on saturday. the post said she considered replacing clinton with then vice president joe biden after clinton fainted in september 2016. in a soon to be published book, brazile recounts deliberations as interim dnc chair whether to initiate the process of removing clinton and running mate tim kaine, a virginia senator, the post reported, saying she ultimately did not seek to remove them. dnc rules give the party’s chair the ability to call a special meeting to consider replacing a nominee in the event of the death, resignation or disability after a candidate has officially been nominated, but only the full dnc has the power to fill vacancies. brazile’s book “hacks: the inside story of the break ins and breakdowns that put donald trump in the white house,” is to be released on tuesday by hachette books.

" ugandan authorities postponed a bill to extend leader yoweri museveni s rule after protesters took to the streets against it on thursday, confronting police who fired teargas. parliament speaker jacob oulanyah told lawmakers during a raucous session that the legislation due to be introduced on thursday afternoon was  bringing tension  and would come back on another, unspecified date. activists, campaign groups, religious leaders and even some members of museveni s own ruling party have objected to the proposed change to the constitution, saying it is undemocratic.      groups of students at makerere, a public university in the capital kampala, rallied to start marching toward parliament before police dispersed them with teargas. protesters regrouped through the morning, throwing stones back at police.  we are not going to allow anybody to hold protest marches. the teargas was to deter that,  police spokesman asan kasingye said. museveni, aged 73, has already been in power for more than three decades. the change to the constitution would have removed a rule banning anyone older that 75 running for president that currently bars him from running for re election at polls in 2021. the move to amend legislation mirrors similar tactics used in rwanda, burundi and the democratic republic congo to extend limits, a trend that has alarmed democracy watchdogs.  museveni won plaudits in the early years of his rule for restoring stability after years of turmoil, and became a key western ally who sent ugandan troops to fight islamist militants in somalia. but accusations of rampant rights violations, entrenched graft and dysfunctional public services have since fueled opposition to his rule.     police have also raided the premises of at least two pro democracy organizations in kampala, including that of the local unit of johannesburg based actionaid international.  security personnel blockaded staff inside their offices late on wednesday and conducted searches, staff members of the organizations told reuters.  there was intelligence that we got that they received funding for people who are planning to cause chaos and violence,  police spokesman kasingye said.  local media said kampala s mayor erias lukwago   an opposition party member   was detained early on thursday, though kasingye said he was unaware of the reports. museveni s bid has also met increasing denunciation from some members of the ruling national resistance movement (nrm) party, exposing cracks. the nrm counts about three thirds of all parliament members.  ultimately... museveni has ample patronage at his disposal and, when push comes to shove, few lawmakers will be prepared to risk political exile by not backing the president,  said charlotte king, a uganda analyst at the economist intelligence unit.  the u.s. embassy in kampala condemned the raids on pro democracy groups.   the united states is deeply concerned that recent arrests and raids stifle the ugandan people s right to free expression and tarnish uganda s global image,  it said in a statement.

" bosnian croat war crimes convict slobodan praljak used cyanide to kill himself in court after losing his appeal, according to preliminary autopsy findings, dutch prosecutors said on friday. praljak, 72, announced that he had taken poison immediately after his conviction and 20 year sentence were upheld by appeals judges at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia on wednesday, and died shortly afterward. in a statement, prosecutors said a toxicological test had found that praljak  had a concentration of potassium cyanide in his blood .  this resulted in a failure of the heart, which is indicated as the suspected cause of death,  they added. earlier on friday, the tribunal said it had launched its own independent review into the death. praljak committed suicide in the final minutes of the last verdict at the court before it closes later this month.  i just drank poison,  the ex general told the stunned court in a hearing that was being broadcast online.  i am not a war criminal. i oppose this conviction.  prosecutors said they were focusing their investigation on how praljak had managed to obtain a banned substance in the high security u.n. building.

" italy s anti establishment 5 star movement, which leads most opinion polls ahead of a national election due by may next year, on friday launched an internal ballot to choose its leader and candidate for prime minister. the hot favorite is 31 year old lower house deputy luigi di maio, the party s most high profile and popular politician, who has made no secret of wanting the job and appears to have no rivals to worry him. the biggest problem for the maverick movement founded eight years ago may be finding credible alternative candidates in the contest, which will take the form of an online vote of 5 star s members, in line with its credo of direct democracy. di maio, who is deputy speaker of the chamber of deputies, is considered a good communicator and one of 5 star s more moderate figures. a post on 5 star s official mouthpiece, the blog of its founder beppe grillo, said the candidate for prime minister would also be the party s leader, something which is not always the case in italian politics. grillo, who founded 5 star in 2009, has so far acted as its de facto chief, though he has never run for any office and the party has always prided itself as having a horizontal structure with no official leader. the only person considered a realistic threat to di maio, the fiery deputy alessandro di battista, has given no indication that he plans to run. another deputy seen as a potential challenger, roberto fico, who represents the left wing of the party and has recently distanced himself from di maio s tough positions on law and order and immigration, has also not yet made any move. the post on grillo s blog said 5 star s local and national representatives who wish to run had until monday to present their candidacies. the timing of the online vote has not yet been set but the winner is due to be announced on sept 23 at 5 star s annual national meeting at the adriatic coastal town of rimini.

" apple inc (aapl.o) will likely seek to invoke the united states’ protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iphone of one of the san bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. the company on thursday was granted three additional days by the court to file a response to the order. apple will now have until feb. 26 to send a reply, a person familiar with matter told reuters. the tech giant and the obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in los angeles handed down an order on tuesday requiring apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. apple chief executive tim cook called the request from the federal bureau of investigation unprecedented. other tech giants such as facebook inc (fb.o), twitter inc (twtr.n) and alphabet inc’s (googl.o) google have rallied to support apple. apple has retained two prominent, free speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers: theodore olson, who won the political speech case citizens united v. federal election commission in 2010, and theodore boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. government lawyers from the u.s. justice department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 u.s. supreme court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. the high court said then that the all writs act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of apple when it files a response in court by early next week. but apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the first amendment’s guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it.  compared with other countries, the united states has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said riana pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at stanford university’s center for internet and society. the order against apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in apple’s possession, pfefferkorn said. “i think there is a significant first amendment concern,” she said. a spokesman for the u.s. attorney’s office in los angeles declined to comment on the possible free speech questions on thursday.      a speech rights argument from apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the u.s. economy.  “that is an argument of enormous breadth,” said stuart benjamin, a duke university law professor who writes about the first amendment. he said apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a “substantive message.” in a case brought by a mathematician against u.s. export controls, a three judge panel of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, which covers california, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. the opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. the fbi and prosecutors are seeking apple’s assistance to read the data on an iphone 5c that had been used by rizwan farook, who along with his wife, tashfeen malik, carried out the san bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. u.s. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said michael froomkin, a university of miami law professor. that is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. in addition, the iphone in dispute was owned not by farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iphone. the federal magistrate who issued the order, sheri pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. “this is one of the worst set of facts possible for apple. that’s why the government picked this case,” froomkin said.  froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to apple’s global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. “all these demands make their phones less attractive to users,” he said.

" france wants to take action to tackle iran s missile program and  destabilizing  behavior but believes scrapping the 2015 nuclear deal would help hardliners and be a step towards future war, france s defense minister said on friday.  we need the jcpoa. scrapping it would be a gift to iran s hardiners, and a first step towards future wars,  florence parly said in a speech at a washington think tank, referring to the nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action.  but we should also be very serious about the destabilizing ballistic and regional activities. we are working on it.  parly is the first french minister to visit the united states since president donald trump s refusal to certify the 2015 iran nuclear deal. she held talks with her american counterpart james mattis and white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement, he gave the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to re impose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between iran and six world powers. that has alarmed its european allies, who fear the deal will slowly unravel.  the issue is now in congress. france has no desire to be embroiled in u.s. domestic politics, but our position on the agreement is clear.

" a sweeping tax reform proposal meant to boost u.s. manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods as president elect donald trump and congressional republicans work to finalize new tax legislation. as republican members of the house of representatives tax committee prepared to discuss tax reform this week, the panel received a letter from 81 industry groups rejecting the proposal known as “border adjustability.” a lynchpin of the house republican “better way” agenda and viewed favorably by trump’s team, the policy would help  manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. but it would tax imports, hitting import dependent industries. house republicans hope to persuade trump to back the policy as a means to fulfill his campaign pledge to create blue collar jobs. this week, incoming trump white house chief of staff reince priebus expressed support for the approach as a possible alternative to tariffs.  trump and house republicans have not reached agreement on border adjustability but could iron out most of their remaining differences on tax reform in two to three weeks, ahead of the jan. 20 inauguration, former trump adviser stephen moore told reporters in michigan. in a dec. 13 letter to house ways and means chairman kevin brady and incoming top democrat richard neal, groups representing the auto and retailing industries, among others, said: “companies that rely on global supply chains would face huge business challenges caused by increased taxes and increased cost of goods.”  they warned of “reductions in employment, reduced capital investments and higher prices for consumers” as potential consequences. “the better way tax reform proposal, without the border adjustment provision, can provide the basis for the strong economic growth we all seek,” it said. border adjustability has come under fire from koch industries, the private conglomerate controlled by billionaires charles and david koch, who support republicans and other conservatives in congress. advocates of border adjustability say the house tax plan would collapse without the more than $1 trillion in revenues the provision would raise to help pay for tax cuts.      in a statement, brady urged companies to focus on the entire plan, which would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and end taxation of u.s. corporate profits overseas. neal said he was encouraged that republicans are considering incentivizing manufacturing and exports but added: “there are genuine concerns that this could result in an increase in consumer prices.” ",0

" nearly two dozen major companies in technology and other industries are planning to launch a coalition to demand legislation that would allow young, illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency, according to documents seen by reuters. the coalition for the american dream intends to ask congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “dreamers,” to continue working in the united states, the documents said. alphabet inc’s google, microsoft corp, amazon.com inc, facebook inc, intel corp, uber technologies inc [uber.ul], ibm corp, marriott international inc and other top u.s. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows. reuters was first to report the news. amazon, intel, uber and univision communications inc [uvn.ul] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. it is possible that plans to launch the group could change. “we’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging congress to pass legislation to protect dreamers,” intel spokesman will moss said in a statement. matthew wing, a spokesman for uber, said, “uber joined the coalition for the american dream because we stand with the dreamers. we’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online dreamer resource center for any of our drivers.” the push for this legislation comes after president donald trump’s september decision to allow the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to expire in march. that program, established by former president barack obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits. some 800 companies signed a letter to congressional leaders after trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting dreamers. that effort was spearheaded by a pro immigration reform group facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg co founded in 2013 called fwd.us. many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. the group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by reuters. “dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies. a signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 fortune 500 companies employ daca recipients.       trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico. he has left the fate of daca up to congress. action may come in december, when congress must pass a spending bill to keep the u.s. government open. democrats have considered insisting on help for the dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown. “no politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be daca recipients’ last holidays in the u.s.,” said todd schulte, president of fwd.us, in an interview on thursday. he declined to comment on the new coalition. “you will see this continue to escalate until the end of the year,” he said.

" italy’s preparations for hosting this year’s group of seven major powers meetings have been hampered by the slow transition at the u.s. state department, which has created decision making bottlenecks, european diplomatic sources said. the g7 draws together the united states, japan, germany, france, britain, italy and canada, with countries taking it in turn to draw up agendas that they see as of pressing concern. italy holds the 2017 presidency and its objectives laid out this week appeared to put rome on a collision course with u.s. president donald trump by promoting highly sensitive topics such as climate change, free trade and immigration initiatives. the g7 foreign ministers meet in tuscany on april 10 11, preparing for a leaders’ summit in sicily at the end of may. however, officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said efforts to reach an agreement on statements and strategy ahead of time   a normal part of pre meeting g7 diplomacy   were going slowly. the immediate concerns lay with the state department, where new secretary of state rex tillerson has left vacant numerous positions seen as vital to drafting summit accords. “it’s very difficult to talk to someone who can give a straight answer because the ones who are there are ‘acting’ head of something and they’re not even very senior,” said a senior italian government official involved in g7 diplomacy.      the white house has yet to nominate candidates for either of the two deputy secretary of state slots, beneath tillerson. further down the chain, all six of the department’s regional bureaus are led by acting assistant secretaries of state, while trump has yet to appoint ambassadors to italy or the vatican. “this has made it extremely difficult for us to prepare for the meeting,” the government official added.  a state department official acknowledged that some positions had yet to be filled, but said that it was preparing for a “successful” series of g7 meetings. “we continue to have a deep bench of experienced and capable staff members serving in key positions and working closely with their g7 counterparts, including our italian hosts,” the official said. a diplomat in another european capital also involved in g7 preparations said the department heads beneath the secretary of state were vital for getting approval for agendas, scheduling and the often delicate wording of policy statements. “we no longer know who to talk to. it is slowing everything down,” he said, adding that any ambitious projects would struggle to take off given the confusion. a senior diplomat in a third eu capital said: “since president trump took office, it has become very difficult to deal with the state department on planning and we are still learning to work with that.”  the senior italian diplomat leading behind the scenes g7 discussions, raffaele trombetta, said this week that africa would play a prominent role in italy’s summit agenda, with seven african leaders invited to join the talks in sicily.  however, in a sign that rome was lowering expectations for this year’s event, the italian government was unlikely to launch any major funding initiative at a time when trump is looking to slash back on u.s. foreign aid. “usually the g7 sets aside money for a particular cause, but this time it doesn’t look like there’s the will to do it. it’s not just the americans. the japanese don’t want one either,” said the italian government source. trombetta said “trust” was the presidency slogan   trust between governments and their citizens, and between countries.  “there is also a need of renewed trust between the leaders who will be attending the summit,” he said, noting that the prime ministers of britain and italy and the presidents of france and the united states would be attending their first g7. eu leaders worry trump might undermine 70 years of strong trans atlantic ties and have been alarmed by his criticism of nato, his support for trade protectionism, his rejection of climate change policies, and his anti migrant rhetoric. flying into these headwinds, trombetta said italy wanted the g7 to reaffirm the importance of the 2015 paris agreement, which obliges nations to curb global warming and which senior white house advisers have called on trump to renounce. rome was also eager for a commitment “to fighting all forms of protectionism”, said trombetta. however, he acknowledged that this might be hard to achieve, with the united states this month already breaking with a tradition of endorsing open trade at a meeting of g20 finance ministers in germany. “it is a highly political issue. i expect it will go up to the leaders. it will be dealt with by them at the taormina summit ... it will be one of the main points of tension of our presidency,” he said. italian prime minister paolo gentiloni is flying to the united states next month, in part to seek an understanding with trump on the g7 agenda ahead of the sicily summit. but if trump pushes back, he is unlikely to face strong resistance from italy, which has made good relations with the united states the cornerstone of its foreign policy.  “we can argue with france, germany and britain, but never with america,” said another senior government official, who was not authorized to talk to the media. “we will do with trump what we always do (with the americans); find a way to get along with him.” ",0
" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on friday: dodd frank trump orders reviews of major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with wall street bankers. wealth managers from wall street to wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against the retirement advice rule that trump began killing off with a swipe of his pen. the united states ratchets up pressure on iran, putting sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities days after the white house put tehran “on notice” over a ballistic missile test. instead of tearing up the iran nuclear deal, the trump administration is exploring how to tighten its enforcement and renegotiate key terms, but it may be impossible to get other major powers and iran to consider revisions. a federal judge in boston declines to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the united states from certain countries despite being barred by trump’s recent executive order. tens of thousands of visas were revoked under trump’s travel ban, the state department says. u.s. immigration officials have postponed interviews with asylum seekers in an australian camp since trump’s executive order on immigration, suggesting washington is already blocking progress on a controversial refugee resettlement deal. chief executives of major u.s. companies met with trump at the white house, with some expressing concern about the ban on people from seven muslim majority countries traveling to the united states. congressional republicans repeal a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and vote to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove obama era regulations on extractive industries. trump’s agenda to repeal obamacare and punish “sanctuary cities” for resisting him on immigration is making its presence felt in the $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. european union leaders agree to stick together in dealing with trump, but at their first summit since he took office they are at odds on how far to confront or engage with him. the trump administration is in the midst “of a full review of all u.s. policies towards cuba” with a focus on its human rights policies.

" u.s. lawmakers on thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address puerto rico’s unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full blown humanitarian crisis. released close to midnight on wednesday, the house natural resources committee’s revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place.  puerto rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million u.s. citizens. in addition, it is reeling from a zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. language allowing puerto rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a “cram down,” remains. the bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised. “tonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in puerto rico. the revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders,” committee chairman rob bishop said in a statement. for a link to a factbox on the bill, click. while both republican and democratic leaders of the u.s. house of representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question. a vote on the bill by the house is expected in the first week of june, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on july 1. in recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity. “after long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work,” u.s. house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement on thursday. house speaker paul ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need democrat votes to get it passed. “right now, the stability of the u.s. territory is in danger, as the puerto rican government continues to default on major loan payments. we have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout,” ryan said in a statement. the bill, formally known as the puerto rico oversight, management and economic stability act (promesa), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future. the white house called the bill an “important first step” in creating a fair process for restructuring puerto rico’s debt and economy after a decade of recession. the u.s. territory’s governor, alejandro garcia padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the island’s self governance. choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill. u.s. treasury secretary jack lew said on thursday he was pleased the bill includes “restructuring tools for puerto rico that are comprehensive and workable” but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a “tough bipartisan compromise.”        in the early drafts of the bill, senator orrin hatch of utah, the chairman of the powerful senate finance committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain. a conservative tea party favorite, representative raul labrador of idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told reuters he thought a majority of republicans would “support it through both houses of congress.” many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the u.s. mainland that are far away from the island’s current crisis. “the bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. we believe the legislation is more positive for both go and cofina creditors than the legislation previously under review,” wrote heights securities analyst daniel hanson. hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners. a local bondholder group said it supported the bill. “as imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the ‘pause’ that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all americans living in puerto rico,” said jorge irizarry, president of the backyard bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in puerto rico.   go, or general obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while cofina debt is backed by sales tax revenues. “this territories clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a ‘bailout’ or ‘contagion,’” the cofina senior bondholders ad hoc group said in a statement.  investors bid up prices on puerto rico’s benchmark july 2035 go

" president donald trump said on sunday he will offer details on how he would like to overhaul president barack obama’s signature healthcare law in a speech to the u.s. congress on tuesday. since they now control the white house and congress, republicans are under pressure to fulfill their pledge to repeal and replace the obamacare law although they have found no easy way to do it.  the law has proven popular in many states, even those controlled by republicans, and it enabled millions of previously uninsured people to get affordable coverage, although steep premium increases angered some.   trump is to talk about healthcare, among other topics, in a nationally televised address on tuesday night to a joint session of congress. trump reiterated his pledge to repeal and replace the obamacare law in remarks at a black tie dinner for the national governors association. “we’re going to be speaking very specifically about a very complicated subject,” trump said. “i think we have something that is really going to be excellent.” republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal to repeal and replace the affordable care act. some moderates want to revise the law and not abandon it entirely while conservatives want to repeal it completely. still to be worked out are details including the future of medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor that was expanded in more than 30 states under obamacare, and how a new healthcare law would be funded. trump said he would be discuss healthcare on monday when he meets some of the governors who are in washington for the national governors association’s annual meeting. trump cast his first weeks in office in a positive light despite stumbles including an executive order aimed at banning people from seven muslim majority nations that was immediately embroiled in a court challenge. “we’ve made a lot of promises over the last two years, and many of those promises already are kept so we’ve very honored by that,” he said. trump turned the microphone over to virginia governor terry mcauliffe, a democrat who chairs the governors association. mcauliffe is a long time supporter of former president bill clinton and his wife, hillary, whom trump defeated in the nov. 8 presidential election. mcauliffe told trump, “we want to work with you” on creating jobs and strong healthcare system.

" the united states does not aim to impede european trade and business transactions with iran despite president donald trump s decision last week to decertify the 2015 nuclear agreement, secretary of state rex tillerson told the wall street journal. european union leaders in brussels on thursday highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with iran from any adverse effects should washington reinstate sanctions against iran, officials said.  the president s been pretty clear that it s not his intent to interfere with business deals that the europeans may have under way with iran,  tillerson told the journal in an interview thursday.  he s said it clearly:  that s fine. you guys do what you want to do.  trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal struck with the united states and five other powers including britain, france and germany. the republican president gave congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for scaling down a program the west fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something tehran denies.  trump has criticized the nuclear accord as  the worst deal ever  and has vowed to withdraw if congress and european allies do not address his problems with it. tillerson s comments appeared aimed at reassuring the europeans that washington is not trying to pressure them into avoiding business with iran.  we ve been working with the europeans for six months,  tillerson said.  they have been brought along with this same thought process. it doesn t mean that they necessarily agree entirely with it. ... now we will start a more formalized process with them now that the policy s been adopted.  the journal said tillerson would not discuss the multibillion dollar deals reached by boeing co (ba.n) under the 2015 accord. boeing, which was the first major u.s. company to announce a major business venture with iran, last year agreed to sell dozens of commercial planes to tehran.

" donald trump’s campaign paid $50,000 to the law office now representing donald trump jr. a little more than a week before news surfaced of an unreported meeting with a russian attorney that has prompted new accusations of collusion. the payment to the law offices of alan s. futerfas, dated june 27, was disclosed in a filing with the federal election commission on saturday. it was described as covering “legal consulting” fees.  trump jr. admitted to meeting with a russian lawyer in new york city during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his father’s rival, democratic candidate hillary clinton. the payment was made to futerfas’ firm days before the story about the meeting broke, which caused a scramble inside the white house and trump tower to contain it.  the disclosures do not say who futerfas was hired to represent. spokesmen for trump’s re election campaign and futerfas did not respond to requests for comment.  futerfas was revealed as trump jr.’s lawyer on monday after a new york times report detailed meetings between the president’s eldest son and the russian lawyer. futerfas has not said when he was hired.      separately, the campaign also paid more than $538,000 to jones day, the law firm that represented trump’s campaign during the election. the campaign also paid $89,561 for “legal consulting” to the trump corporation, which is owned by the president. the payment was dated june 30th. a federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by u.s. intelligence agencies that russia meddled in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, as well as potential connections between russian officials and the trump campaign. moscow has denied any interference and the president and trump jr. have denied any collusion. the federal election commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate. trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser, marc kasowitz, as outside counsel. his campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to kasowitz. the white house confirmed in a statement on saturday that veteran washington attorney ty cobb will serve as special counsel, and sources familiar with the hiring said cobb would handle the white house’s response to the russia related investigations. cobb, a partner at the law firm hogan lovells, is expected to be an intermediary between the white house and congress, as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue.  in the second quarter of 2017, trump’s re election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million, according to saturday’s disclosures. much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of “small dollar” donations, classed as donations of less than $250. trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small dollar donors as proof of his widespread support. trump filed for re election the day after taking office   allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office.

" with trouble facing him back home, u.s. president donald trump ended his nine day overseas journey in dramatic fashion on saturday, addressing u.s. troops at a campaign style rally. trump flipped traditional u.s. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the middle east and europe, coddling middle eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional european allies pay more for their defense. at a group of seven summit in the resort town of taormina on the island of sicily, trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain u.s. support for the paris climate agreement, insisting he needed more time to make up his mind. in a hangar at naval air station sigonella, which is also on sicily, trump was introduced by his wife melania, who has raised eyebrows during the trip by twice flicking away her husband’s hand when he tried to hold hers. “my husband worked very hard on this trip and i am very proud of him,” she said. trump, whose marine one helicopter landed from taormina to the soaring soundtrack of the “air force one” movie, emerged from two days of closed door summitry to declare his trip a success. trump said he had helped forge more international cooperation in the fight against islamist militants, a threat he said was underscored by a suicide bomber in manchester, england, and the killing of coptic christians in egypt. “it was a tremendously productive meeting where i strengthen american bonds,” said trump. “we have great bonds with other countries and, with some of our closest allies, we concluded a truly historic week.” trump skipped the traditional end of trip news conference to avoid facing questions about a host of problems he faces upon his return to washington later on saturday. his may 9 firing of former fbi director james comey has raised concerns about whether he was trying to squelch a federal probe into his campaign’s ties with russia last year. the questions have been intensified in the wake of disclosures on friday that a senior adviser, jared kushner, the husband of trump’s daughter ivanka, had contacts with the russians in december about opening a secret back channel of communications with moscow. trump used his trip to promote “america first” policies,  promoting $110 billion worth of arms sales to saudi arabia and telling g 7 allies that the united states needs a more level playing field on trade. his body language on the trip demonstrated his typically brash behavior, dramatized by his demands that nato allies pay more for their defense and his refusal to explicitly declare that the united states backs article 5 of the alliance’s charter, which requires each member to come to the defense of each other. his pushing aside of the prime minister of montenegro to get in place for a family photo generated headlines across europe. at sigonella, trump said his appeals to nato allies to pay more was working. “money is starting to flow in,” he said. “it’s only fair to the united states. we’re behind nato all the way. but we want to be treated fairly.” ",0

" u.s. president donald trump and republicans in congress would have a hard time slashing the corporate tax rate to below 26 percent, even if they eliminated nearly every business tax preference, according to a study released on wednesday. the analysis by the tax policy center, a nonpartisan think tank, found republicans might have to expand the federal budget deficit to cut the corporate rate to trump’s proposed 15 percent or to the 23 percent level sought by leading tax policymakers from congress and the administration. the corporate income tax rate is now 35 percent, although many companies pay far less than that thanks to abundant loopholes. “there’s a lower boundary on this and it’s much higher than what the president and congressional republicans say,” said howard gleckman, a senior fellow at the center. “the most likely outcome is that they’re not going to reduce corporate taxes as much as they’d like to,” he said. republicans have vowed to slash business tax rates, saying it would boost economic growth and help create jobs. eliminating tax breaks are a main focus of closed door negotiations on capitol hill and in the white house. but no policymakers have gone as far as the tax policy center did in its study, measuring the impact of throwing out hundreds of tax breaks, including subsidies for research, alternative energy, fossil fuels and domestic manufacturing. “in a revenue neutral bill, congress can’t get the rate below 26 percent even if it eliminates nearly every corporate tax expenditure,” gleckman said in a blog posting accompanying the study.  white house officials and conservatives in congress, including senator ted cruz, have called for deficit funded tax cuts as a way to spur economic growth. but analysts warn that expanding the deficit would undermine economic growth by raising the federal debt burden and forcing interest rates higher. gleckman said policymakers could pay for tax cuts by finding new sources of revenue to compensate for lower rates, rather than expanding the deficit. but republicans have already rejected revenue raising options, including a border adjustment import tax and a carbon tax. the study was funded by the nonprofit peter g. peterson foundation.

" the u.s. department of justice’s move to block at&t inc’s $85.4 billion acquisition of time warner inc was “foolish” because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier’s trial lawyer dan petrocelli told cnbc on tuesday. the justice department on monday sued at&t arguing that the u.s. no. 2 wireless carrier would use time warner’s content to force rival pay tv companies to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for time warner’s networks.” at&t has vowed to defend the deal. “we want to go to court as soon as possible,” petrocelli told cnbc, saying the burden of proof was on the government.  the case was initially assigned on tuesday to judge christopher cooper in federal court in washington but later reassigned to judge richard leon.  the case will be closely watched because u.s. president donald trump has been a vocal critic of time warner’s cnn, and opposed at&t’s purchase of time warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in at&t’s hands.  in antitrust circles, the court fight will be closely watched since the justice department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal   where the merging companies are not direct competitors   since the 1970s, when it prevented ford motor co from buying assets from spark plug maker autolite.

" cyril ramaphosa, the new leader of south africa s governing anc party, said on thursday he aims to stamp out corruption and pursue a policy of  radical economic transformation  that will speed up expropriation of land without compensation. ramaphosa, a 65 year old union leader who became a businessman and is now one of south africa s richest people, is likely to become the country s next president after elections in 2019, because of his party s electoral dominance. his promise to fight rampant corruption and revitalize the economy has been hailed by foreign investors.  this conference has resolved that corruption must be fought with the same intensity and purpose that we fight poverty, unemployment and inequality,  ramaphosa said in his maiden speech at the close of a five day party meeting where he was elected.  we must also act fearlessly against alleged corruption and abuse of office within our ranks,  he said in the early hours of thursday after a long delay. ramaphosa, who is south africa s deputy president, was elected the new leader of the african national congress (anc) on monday, succeeding president jacob zuma as party head after zuma s presidency became tainted with corruption allegations. ramaphosa s narrow victory over former cabinet minister and african union commission chairwoman nkosazana dlamini zuma, 68, is seen as a pivotal moment for the anc, which launched black majority rule under nelson mandela s leadership 23 years ago but is now deeply divided with its image tarnished. ramaphosa paid tribute to zuma in his speech, saying the anc would be  united  despite a fractious campaign. zuma had backed his ex wife dlamini zuma for anc s top job. however, investors are concerned that ramaphosa may not be able to push through policy changes because the anc s top decision making group, known as the  top six , was split down the middle, with three politicians apiece drawn from ramaphosa s camp and that of dlamini zuma. analysts warned that the division of the party presidency, held by ramaphosa, and the state presidency in zuma s hands, could lead to policy uncertainty or paralysis.  mr. zuma, for instance, still occupies south africa s presidency   a cohabitation that may cause a period of policy uncertainty,  capital economics africa economist john ashbourne said  in a note.  expectations that ramaphosa would win the anc race had pushed the rand to 12.5200 per dollar on monday, its firmest since march 27, when a cabinet reshuffle by zuma rocked markets and triggered credit ratings downgrades to  junk.  the rand weakened on tuesday, but firmed on wednesday as investors continued to digest how much clout ramaphosa wields.  victory for ramaphosa, but not a loss for zuma,  said geoff blount, managing director at bayhill capital. zuma has faced allegations of corruption since he became head of state in 2009, but has denied any wrongdoing. the president has also faced allegations that his friends the wealthy gupta businessmen wielded undue influence over his government. zuma and the guptas have denied the accusations. ramaphosa alluded to these allegations in his speech, saying,  at the state level we must confront the reality that critical institutions of our state have been targeted by individuals and families, through the exercise of influence and the manipulation of governance processes and public resources.  he said this had weakened the state owned enterprises in africa s most industrialized economy. south africa, the continent s traditional powerhouse, has had lethargic growth over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels. ramaphosa also had a warning for corporate executives.  we must investigate without fear or favor the so called  accounting irregularities  that cause turmoil in the markets and wipe billions off the investments of ordinary south africans,  he said. south african furniture retailer steinhoff, has been embroiled in a scandal over accounting irregularities, which have wiped more than $10 billion off its market value over the past two weeks. ramaphosa also said he would aim to expedite job creation, improve the lackluster economy and speed up the transfer of land to black people. two decades after the end of apartheid, the anc is under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership where whites own most of the land.  this conference has resolved that the expropriation of land without compensation should be among the mechanisms available to government to give effect to land reform and redistribution,  ramaphosa said. he said the land transfers would be speeded up under the radical economic transformation program, a vague anc plan to tackle racial inequality.

" kenyan police are not cooperating with investigations by a government funded watchdog into violent deaths that followed last month s election, two sources with direct knowledge of the probes said. the head of the independent police oversight authority (ipoa) told reuters in mid august it was fast tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible following the aug. 8 national ballot.  macharia njeru had attended autopsies of a young girl and a baby and called the probes into those deaths  priority cases . but the sources told reuters that police had to date not transferred any documents or evidence to ipoa, which is mandated to investigate cases reported by individuals or police or referred to them by human rights organizations.  the big frustration of ipoa is that the police do not share information  critical to investigations into police misconduct, one of the sources said.  ... (but) officers feel ipoa is there to harass them.  the police are required by law to cooperate with the ipoa, which is civilian run. a spokesman for the force, charles owino, did not respond to phone calls on wednesday afternoon. interior minister fred matiang i last month denied accusations of police brutality. he said  criminal elements , not legitimate political protesters, had caused trouble after the election that provoked a police response. protests broke out after the election board announced that incumbent president uhuru kenyatta had won by 1.4 million votes. opposition leader raila odinga disputed the result and took his case to the supreme court, which on friday scrapped the result and ordered a new poll within 60 days. [l8n1li1qy]      the state funded kenya national commission on human rights says at least 28 people were killed in shootings in the days after the results were announced. it said it believes the killings were linked to the police. evidence relevant to the investigations could include documents such as police deployment plans and operational orders as well as internal reports into alleged misconduct by officers or units, one of the sources said. an ipoa spokeswoman said the monitor did not discuss ongoing investigations with the media.  the authority became operational in 2012 and has so far secured the conviction of two police officers in a 2014 murder of a teenage girl in a coastal kenyan town.  in its annual reports for 2014 to 2016, it listed  suspicion by the police , delays in response to requests for information and lack of cooperation from some officers as factors impeding its operations.

" at least 24 militants and six soldiers were killed on sunday in attacks on military outposts in north sinai, the egyptian military said in a statement. the statement did not give details, but security and medical sources said about 20 members of the security forces had also been injured when more than 100 militants repeatedly attacked security outposts south of the border town of sheikh zuweid. the attackers used car bombs and rocket propelled grenades (rpg), the sources said. the militants also clashed with the security forces using light weapons, the sources added. islamic state claimed responsibility for the attacks. hours later, air raid sirens went off in a part of southern israel and the israeli military said two rockets were fired from sinai at israel. there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. on friday, the militant group claimed an attack on security forces in the peninsula that killed at least six soldiers. egypt is fighting an insurgency by militants affiliated with islamic state in the sinai peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013, when the military ousted islamist president mohamed mursi after mass protests. the militants have also extended their campaign to other parts of egypt, most recently attacking churches in cairo and other cities with the loss of dozens of lives.

" backers of a u.s. russian plan to build nuclear reactors across the middle east bragged after the u.s. election they had backing from donald trump’s national security adviser michael flynn for a project that required lifting sanctions on russia, documents reviewed by reuters show. the documents, which have not previously been made public, reveal new aspects of the plan, including the proposed involvement of a russian company currently under u.s. sanctions to manufacture nuclear equipment. that company, major engineering and construction firm omz oao, declined to comment. the documents do not show whether flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, took concrete steps to push the proposal with trump and his aides. but they do show that washington based nuclear power consultancy acu strategic partners believed that both flynn, who had worked as an adviser to the firm as late as mid 2016, and trump were firmly in its corner. “donald trump’s election as president is a game changer because trump’s highest foreign policy priority is to stabilize u.s. relations with russia which are now at a historical low point,” acu’s managing director, alex copson, wrote in a nov. 16, 2016 email to potential business partners, eight days after the election. white house officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. acu declined comment and also declined to make copson available for an interview. previously they told a congressional committee that they had not had any dealings with flynn since may 2016, before trump became the republican party’s presidential candidate.  flynn’s lawyer, robert kelner, did not respond to a request for comment. flynn pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the fbi about a discussion with the former russian ambassador to washington, sergey kislyak, in late december 2016 regarding sanctions.   the documents also show that acu proposed ending ukraine’s opposition to lifting sanctions on russia by giving a ukrainian company a $45 billion contract to provide turbine generators for reactors to be built in saudi arabia and other mideast nations.     the contract to state owned turboatom, and loans to ukraine from gulf arab states, would “require ukraine to support lifting us and eu sanctions on russia,” copson wrote in the nov. 16 email. a turboatom spokeswoman said she did not have an immediate comment on the matter.     the email was titled “trump/putin me marshall plan concept.” me stands for middle east. the title, evoking the post world war two plan to rebuild western european economies, reflected the hopes of the plan’s backers that trump and russian president vladimir putin could cooperate on a project that would boost middle east economies.     the email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2aldocy the acu documents reviewed by reuters include emails, business presentations and financial estimates and date from late autumn 2016. as part of their investigation into the trump election campaign’s ties to russia, special counsel robert mueller and democrats on the house of representatives’ oversight committee are probing whether flynn promoted the middle east nuclear power project as national security adviser in trump’s white house. flynn resigned after just 24 days as national security adviser after it became known he had lied to vice president mike pence by telling him he had not discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with kislyak in late december.  in response to questions about the emails and documents, acu referred reuters to letters written in june and september by acu scientist thomas cochran to the house oversight committee. in those letters, cochran had laid out the project’s strategy, describing a “ready to go” consortium that included  french, russian, israeli and ukrainian interests, without naming specific companies.  representative elijah cummings, the committee’s top democrat, said the panel’s republican chairman, trey gowdy, has for months rejected democrats’ requests to ask the white house for documents pertaining to the acu proposal. gowdy “has blocked all efforts to allow committee members to vote on issuing subpoenas,” cummings told reuters. gowdy did not respond to requests for comment. the acu’s nuclear reactor plan aimed to provide washington’s middle east allies with nuclear power in a way that didn’t risk nuclear weapons proliferation and also helped counter iranian influence, improve dismal u.s. russian relations, and revive the moribund u.s. nuclear industry, according to the documents seen by reuters.     the wall street journal and the washington post reported this week that flynn pushed a version of the nuclear project within the white house by instructing his staff to rework a memo written by a former business associate into policy for trump to sign.      two u.s. officials familiar with the issue told reuters the policy document flynn prepared for trump’s approval proposed  working with russia on a nuclear reactor project but did not specifically mention acu. the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know if trump had read the memo or acted upon it.     on nov. 18, 2016, 10 days after trump won the presidential election, acu’s copson received an email from nuclear non proliferation expert reuben sorensen saying that he had updated flynn on the nuclear project’s status. sorensen’s role in the project was not clear from the emails.     “flynn is getting closer to (being named) national security advisor. expect an announcement soon. this is a big win for the acu project,” sorensen wrote.  “spoke with him via backchannels earlier this week. he has always believed in the vision of the acu effort ... we need to let him get settled into the new position, but update him shortly thereafter,” sorensen added. the email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2ztqxcz reuters could not independently confirm a briefing took place. sorensen did not reply to an email seeking comment.     on nov. 30, 2016, copson briefed u.s. representative ed royce, republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, on the nuclear project, an email shows.     copson was joined by jim hamel, a senior official from curtiss wright corp., which has a nuclear division based in royce’s california district and was eager for a role in the multi billion dollar project.     in a follow up email on dec. 5 to a royce aide, hamel wrote, “we hope that the chairman will follow up on alex’s suggestion to reach out to general flynn” to discuss the project.     royce’s spokesman, cory fritz, confirmed the briefing to reuters. “no action was ever taken by the chairman or the committee,” he said in an email.     hamel and curtiss wright declined to comment.     flynn was an adviser to acu from april 2015 to june 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in august 2017 to the office of government ethics.       democrats on the house oversight committee say that when flynn applied last year to renew his government security clearance, he failed to disclose a june 2015 trip he made to egypt and israel to promote the reactor project. flynn has not commented

" president barack obama’s deputy national security adviser ben rhodes will travel to miami next week to meet with leaders from the cuban american community to allay concerns about obama’s historic trip to cuba later this month, a white house official told reuters. “miami has long been at the heart of the cuban american community, and this trip will provide an opportunity to continue the important dialogue about the president’s efforts to normalize relations with cuba,” the official said. rhodes, who helped negotiate the thaw in washington’s relations with the island nation, will meet with human rights advocates, religious leaders, and private sector representatives during his march 11 trip. obama goes to havana in mid march in what will be the first visit by a u.s. president to the caribbean nation since 1928.  republicans and some leaders in the cuban american community  oppose the trip, believing it will give legitimacy to the island’s communist government. rhodes will seek to allay those concerns and discuss what the president hopes to achieve by going to havana, the official said. obama plans to meet with dissidents as well as president raul castro during his stay in cuba.

" u.s. president donald trump greeted japanese emperor akihito and empress michiko on monday with a genteel handshake and nod, but no bow, avoiding the pitfall of u.s. president barack obama who was criticized at home for his deep bow to the monarch. trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83 year old emperor before greeting michiko as well. the four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. after the meeting, trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperor s arm repeatedly with his left hand.  thank you for the great meeting , he told akihito.  i m sure we will meet again . obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to akihito. some u.s. commentators said the u.s. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of world war ii, which was waged across asia in his father s name, emperor hirohito. obama also faced criticism from a different quarter   etiquette experts   who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in japan traditionally, whether meeting the emperor or anyone else. japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. hillary clinton shook hands and air kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern japan in march of that year. traditionalists say that japan s chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. akihito was the first royal heir in the japanese imperial family to marry a commoner   a symbol of japan s new modernity and confidence. japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, crown prince naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. akihito s father, emperor hirohito, was considered divine until after japan s defeat in world war two. the current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected.

" u.s. president barack obama is tired of hearing republican presidential candidate donald trump described as a populist. the democratic leader, who has made no secret of his dislike for the wealthy businessman’s rhetoric, closed a news conference in canada on wednesday with a long riff on what makes a leader qualified for the “populist” mantra. trump did not meet the criteria, obama said, without mentioning the republican by name. “somebody ... who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care,” does not meet the definition, obama said. “they don’t suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. that’s not the measure of populism. that’s nativism, or xenophobia. or worse. or it’s just cynicism,” he said. trump won enough grassroots support among republicans to make him the party’s presumptive presidential nominee with a pledge to ban muslims temporarily from entering the united states and to build a wall on the u.s. border with mexico, and a series of other inflammatory remarks. obama has sharply criticized trump for such rhetoric.  he plans to campaign with former secretary of state hillary clinton, the presumptive democratic presidential nominee, next week. the president’s latest criticism of trump could foreshadow obama’s strategy to help clinton on the campaign trail.  he made a point of saying u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, clinton’s opponent in the race for the democratic presidential nomination, genuinely deserved the title of populist.  sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist and generated huge support from young people across the united states in his campaign. clinton needs those supporters now, and obama, who won the white house in 2008 and 2012 with a similar coalition, will try to help deliver them for her. obama, who leaves office in january, made his comments on wednesday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau and mexican president enrique pena nieto looking on. “sorry,” obama said after his more than six minute monologue. “it’s the prerogative of an outgoing president to go on an occasional rant, he said.

" federal prosecutors in alexandria, virginia, have expanded a long running grand jury investigation into wikileaks to include the leak of central intelligence agency documents to the website, a source familiar with the inquiry said. the source, who is familiar with the investigation and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said the probe is focused on who leaked descriptions and technical information on techniques and tools the cia has used to eavesdrop on intelligence targets to the website. u.s. agencies have made only vague public comments on the latest wikileaks disclosures, but security and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said in the wake of the leaks that it is focused on whether an intelligence contractor was responsible. at this point, they said, investigators do not think russia or another foreign government was involved. u.s. officials have confirmed that alexandria based prosecutors have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation into wikileaks and its sources. some court documents on elements of the inquiry have been made public.  the u.s. justice department declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the cia, which has not publicly confirmed the authenticity of the material made public by wikileaks. the website said the material it published comprised thousands of pages of internal cia discussions about hacking techniques and the use of popular products such as apple inc iphones; google inc android devices; and samsung electronics television sets to spy on people. wikileaks founder julian assange said his website would provide technology companies with access to the cia hacking tools it acquired, enabling the companies to patch software vulnerabilities.

" peruvian villagers suing miner glencore will argue in london s high court next week that the company should be held liable over their allegations they were abused by peruvian police, the law firm representing them said on tuesday. the allegations, to be presented in a 10 day hearing that starts on monday, illustrates potential legal risks for mining companies that sign pacts with peruvian police for the provision of security services at their operations. the lawsuit by 22 peruvians said that xstrata, acquired by glencore in 2013, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent abuses by police in deadly protests at the tintaya copper mine in 2012, said london law firm leigh day. xstrata paid, fed and provided lodging for police and knew or should have known that peru s police tend to use excessive force, leigh day said. glencore said xstrata was not responsible for actions taken by the peruvian national police (pnp) in policing the protests and noted that the lawsuit does not allege that xstrata or the mine s private security force harmed anyone. xstrata  appealed to the pnp to respect the human rights of protesters before and during the protest,  glencore said in a statement. like many mining companies in peru, xstrata had signed an agreement with peru s national police for the provision of security services at tintaya, which stopped operating in 2013. the agreements, which usually include payment for police, have long been criticized by activists who say it creates a police force loyal to companies instead of the broader public.     defenders of the agreements say that they allow companies to pay for their policing needs in poor, remote regions where they tend to operate alongside villages that lack basic services. leigh day law firm said that a peruvian villager believed to have been shot by police in the 2012 unrest will attend the hearing. the case will be determined under peruvian law, the firm said.

" the u.s. labor department will delay implementation of its “fiduciary” rule by 60 days while it undertakes a review on whether the rule may hinder americans’ ability to get access to retirement investment advice, according to a filing in the federal register. the department’s rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to act in the best interest of their customers, has been heavily criticized by republicans and wall street amid concerns it may make investment advice too costly. the delay of the rule, which was slated to take effect april 10, was prompted after president donald trump in february ordered the department to conduct the review on whether it should be revised or repealed. in order to delay the effective date, the department had to undertake a formal rule making process.  if the department ultimately decides on a repeal or change, it will need to undertake another rule making process in the future. in addition to the 60 day delay, the department also said that other regulatory requirements in the rule for firms to provide disclosures and written representations of compliance to investors will not be mandated until jan. 1, 2018. that date, the department added, is when it expects to complete its review. as of march 17, the department said it had received 15,000 comments in support of a delay, versus 178,000 comments opposing any delay.  despite the lop sided results, the department said a delay is justified because time is needed to complete the presidentially mandated review. rigid adherence to the original april 10 compliance deadline, the department said, could result in “an unduly chaotic transition to the new standards” and lead to “confusion, excessive costs, and needlessly restricted or reduced advisory services.” ",0

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s transition team is weighing an “infrastructure bank” to make investments in the nation’s infrastructure, trump adviser steven mnuchin told reporters on wednesday. mnuchin, a wall street veteran under consideration for trump’s treasury secretary, said the team was focused on  “taxes... regulatory changes, looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments.”  “i’d say the economic priorities are clearly taxes, regulatory, trade, infrastructure,” he added.

" an organization established for u.s. president donald trump’s transition to the white house said on saturday the special counsel investigating allegations of russian meddling in the 2016 election had obtained tens of thousands of emails unlawfully. kory langhofer, counsel to the transition team known as trump for america, inc. (tfa), wrote a letter to congressional committees to say special counsel robert mueller’s team had improperly received the emails from the general services administration (gsa), a government agency. career staff members at the agency “unlawfully produced tfa’s private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel’s office,” according to the letter, a copy  of which was seen by reuters. it said the materials included “tens of thousands of emails.” trump’s transition team used facilities of the gsa, which helps manage the u.s. government bureaucracy, in the period between the republican’s november presidential election victory and his inauguration in january.     the trump team’s accusation adds to the growing friction between the president’s supporters and mueller’s office as it investigates whether russia interfered in the election and if trump or anyone on his team colluded with moscow. asked for comment, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said: “we continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.” the special counsel’s office waved off the transition team’s complaint. “when we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process,” said peter carr, spokesman for the special counsel’s office. the gsa did not respond immediately to a request for comment. democrats say there is a wide ranging effort by the president’s allies on capitol hill and in some media outlets to discredit mueller’s investigation. trump himself has loudly declared mueller’s effort a waste of time. “there is absolutely no collusion. that has been proven,” trump told reporters on friday. russia denies interfering in the election.  on friday, representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee, said he fears the committee’s republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. some republicans have argued that mueller is biased against trump and should be fired. langhofer’s letter was sent to the u.s. senate committee on homeland security and government affairs, and the u.s. house committee on oversight and government reform. it asked for congress to act immediately “to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.” the letter said mueller’s office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the gsa did not own or control the records. it said the special counsel’s office has “extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege” without notifying the trump for america team. on the transition team were a number of aides who were later caught up in mueller’s investigation, such as former national security adviser michael flynn. flynn pleaded guilty this month to lying to the fbi about his contacts with russia. langhofer, the trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the gsa’s transfer of materials was discovered on dec. 12 and 13. the fbi had requested the materials from gsa staff on aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones and other materials associated with nine members of the trump transition team responsible for national security and policy matters, the letter said. the fbi requested the materials of four additional senior members of the trump transition team on aug. 30, it said. langhofer argued that, while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, non profit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.

" brazilian president michel temer faces a split in his coalition that is likely to derail his plans to put brazil s financial house in order after a majority of congressmen from his main ally party voted to put him on trial on graft allegations.  the lower house of congress voted 251 233 on wednesday to shelve the corruption case against temer, ensuring his survival in office. but the president s reform agenda appears in tatters, with little chance of passing an effective overhaul of the costly social security pension system after most brazilian social democratic party (psdb) lawmakers opted for him to go on trial. in the biggest revolt yet against his 13 month old government, 23 congressmen for the psdb voted to have him stand trial before the supreme court, with only 20 supporting the president.  with his coalition in disarray, temer cannot muster sufficient votes to pass a pension reform that is the cornerstone of his efforts to plug a budget deficit that has scared off investors. temer celebrated his wednesday victory by proclaiming that  the truth had won out  and said his government would return to its task of recovering brazil from its worst ever recession.  his chief of staff eliseu padilha said pension reform talks would resume within days. however, temer did not even win a simple majority on wednesday night in the 513 seat lower house.  that simple majority is needed to pass any new laws, and was far from the 308 vote super majority required for a constitutional amendment such as the pension reform bill.  i don t see it being approved, or even debated,  fabio sousa, a first term psdb lawmaker, said of the pension reform.  his government is fragile and there are general elections next year.  sousa believes there were grounds to put temer on trial for graft and he wants to see his party break with the government and withdraw its four ministers from the cabinet. many in the psdb, while backing economic reforms like those temer has proposed, think they need to come from a more legitimate government. temer s popularity has sunk below that of impeached leftist dilma rousseff who he helped oust last year. brazil s stocks, foreign currency and other financial markets reacted calmly to wednesday s vote, with ups and downs far below 1 percent, a sign that temer s survival by a narrow margin was well priced in.  everyone knows temer is a lame duck now, and nobody believes in social security reform anymore,  said fabio knijnik,  managing director for sao paulo based wealth fund k2 capital. he said that if even the smallest pension reform passes, it would be a big surprise and plus for investors.  finance minister henrique meirelles told journalists the government would insist with its current proposal of a minimum retirement age and stricter rules for pension benefits. the pension bill would make brazilians retire later in order to stave off a financial collapse of the social security system. many lawmakers, including those who voted to spare temer from a criminal trial, are reluctant to vote for an unpopular bill with elections approaching in 2018.  it is clear that a broad pension reform will not be approved in congress by the temer administration. but some changes are possible,  political analysts at brasilia based consultancy arko advice wrote in a report this week.

" five iraqi passengers and one yemeni were barred from boarding an egyptair flight from cairo to new york on saturday after president donald trump halted the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries, sources at cairo airport said. the passengers, arriving in transit to cairo airport, were stopped and re directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  trump on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other muslim majority countries, saying the moves would help protect americans from terrorist attacks. he said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. “i’m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states of america. don’t want them here,” trump said earlier on friday at the pentagon. “we only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,” he said. the bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would be travelers with passports from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. besides cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by trump had swiftly implemented the ban. arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. the order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move trump separately said was aimed at helping christians in syria. that led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. one group said it would announce a court challenge on monday. the council on american islamic relations said the order targets muslims because of their faith, contravening the u.s. constitutional right to freedom of religion. “president trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of muslim countries under the banner of national security,” said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association.  trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the nov. 8 election. but people who work with muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. even legal permanent residents   people with “green cards” allowing them to live and work in the united states   were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to muslim advocates, a civil rights group in washington.  on friday evening, abed ayoub of the american arab anti discrimination committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the united states for medical care and others. “it’s chaos,” ayoub said. during his campaign, trump tapped into american fears about islamic state militants and the flood of migrants into europe from syria’s civil war, saying refugees could be a “trojan horse” that allowed attackers to enter the united states. in december 2015, he called for a ban on all muslims entering the united states, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the u.s. constitution. his idea later evolved into a proposal for “extreme vetting.”  trump’s order also suspends the syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network that the exception would help syrian christians fleeing the civil war there. legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. “if they are thinking about an exception for christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,” said stephen legomsky, a former chief counsel at u.s. citizenship and immigration services in the obama administration. but peter spiro, a professor at temple university beasley school of law, said trump’s action would likely be constitutional because the president and congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. “it’s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,” spiro said. the order may also affect special refugee programs for iraqis who worked for the u.s. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of iraq. it is already affecting refugees and their families, said jen smyers of the church world service, a protestant faith based group that works with migrants. smyers said she spoke to an iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in iraq due to processing delays. “those two 18 year old daughters won’t be able to join their mother in the u.s.,” she said. democrats on friday were quick to condemn trump’s order as un american, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the united states as a land that welcomes immigrants. “today’s executive order from president trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,” said democratic senator edward markey in a statement. some republicans praised the move. representative bob goodlatte, chairman of the house of representatives judiciary committee, said islamic state has threatened to use the u.s. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. “i am pleased that president trump is using the tools granted to him by congress and the power granted by the constitution to help keep america safe and ensure we know who is entering the united states,” goodlatte said in a statement. without naming trump, iranian president hassan rouhani said on saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. trump on wednesday ordered the construction of a u.s. mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. “today is not the time to erect walls between nations. they have forgotten that the berlin wall fell years ago,” rouhani said in a speech carried live on iranian state television. he made no direct reference to trump’s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly muslim states. rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed iran’s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. rouhani said earlier this month that trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was “meaningless”. france and germany voiced disquiet on saturday over trump’s new restrictions on immigration. “welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,” french foreign minister jean marc ayrault said at a joint news conference with german counterpart sigmar gabriel. “the united states is a country where christian traditions have an important meaning. loving your neighbor is a major christian value, and that includes helping people,” said  gabriel. “i think that is what unites us in the west, and i think that is what we want to make clear to the americans.” ",0
" republicans on sunday urged president donald trump’s new chief of staff john kelly to rein in the chaos within the white house on monday but said the retired marine corps general will be challenged to assert control. in his first six months in office, trump has upended white house convention with a loose decision making style and an open door policy to his oval office for advisers, both internal and external. infighting among his senior staff has become bitter and public. “he’s going to have to reduce the drama, reduce both the sniping within and reduce the leaks, and bring some discipline to the relationships,” karl rove, a republican strategist and former white house adviser to george w. bush, said on “fox news sunday.” trump announced kelly would replace his embattled chief of staff reince priebus at the end of a particularly chaotic week that saw his first legislative effort   healthcare reform   fail in congress. “he (trump) is in a lot of trouble. this week was the most tumultuous week we’ve seen in a tumultuous presidency,” rove said. on top of the healthcare debacle, trump came under fire for banning transgender people from the military, and was pilloried for politicizing a speech he made to the boy scouts. adding fuel to the fire, his new communications director anthony scaramucci unleashed a string of profane criticism about priebus and trump strategist steven bannon to a new yorker magazine reporter. republicans welcomed trump’s decision to bring in kelly, who starts on monday. “i think he will bring some order and discipline to the west wing,” said republican senator susan collins and trump critic on  nbc’s “meet the press.” the last week heightened concerns in trump’s party that the distractions and west wing dysfunction would derail other legislative priorities, including tax reform and debt ceiling negotiations. white house budget director mick mulvaney said he thought priebus had been effective “but was probably a little bit more laid back” in the way he ran the office. “i think the president wants to go in a different direction, wants a little bit more discipline, a little more structure in there,” said mulvaney, who reports to the chief of staff. it is not yet clear whether all of trump’s senior staff will answer to kelly. some members, including scaramucci and senior counselor kellyanne conway, report directly to trump, a structure which gives them more power. “i will do whatever the president and our new chief of staff general kelly ask me to do,” conway told fox news’ “fox news sunday.” kelly should be empowered to be the gatekeeper to the oval office, said mike huckabee, the former republican governor of arkansas, whose daughter sarah sanders is trump’s spokeswoman. “that’s what needs to happen, but that’s going to be up to the president,” huckabee said on fox news’ “sunday morning futures.” “the president has a very different style, he’s very open, the door is open, he invites people to just come on it to a meeting,” huckabee said. to be effective, kelly needs to find a way to work within trump’s untraditional style, said corey lewandowski, who was a former campaign manager to trump, and remains close to the president. “the thing that general kelly should do is not try to change donald trump,” lewandowski said on nbc’s “meet the press.” “anybody who thinks they’re going to change donald trump doesn’t know donald trump,” lewandowski said.

" chicago mayor rahm emanuel proposed a fiscal 2018 budget on wednesday that he said eschews “fiscal smoke and mirrors,” but critics said vestiges of those practices remain. in his annual budget speech to the city council, emanuel said the spending plan is free of what he called any “budget gimmick” like so called scoop and toss, which extends maturities on existing bonds to provide budget relief, for the first time since he took office. “every single bad financial practice we inherited in 2011 has now been eliminated from the budget,” he said. the $10 billion budget, which includes $3.77 billion for operations, relies on $94 million in savings from a future bond refinancing under a new debt structure.  a chronic structural budget deficit and an unfunded pension liability that totaled $35.76 billion at the end of 2016 have led to low credit ratings and increased borrowing costs for the nation’s third largest city. the mayor’s budget accelerates savings from a plan approved by the city council this month to refinance up to $3 billion of sales tax revenue and general obligation bonds through a new entity at lower interest rates. the new sales tax securitization corp will be assigned chicago’s state collected sales tax revenue and will pledge that money to pay off the refinanced bonds. bond investors will have a statutory lien shielding the debt from municipal bankruptcy, which is not allowed under illinois law. carole brown, chicago’s chief financial officer, said the city will realize more savings from the debt refinancing in fiscal 2018, which begins on jan. 1, than in 2019. “but we’ll expect to show savings annually until we’ve amortized all the debt,” she added. one critic, alderman john arena, said the new debt structure   which he opposed   could end up extending the life of some bonds by as much as 40 years.  “our fear is that (emanuel is) making the claim of moving scoop and toss out of the way we do business but really moving it over to that special entity,” he said.   brown acknowledged that to achieve level debt service on the corporation’s bonds, maturities on existing bonds may change.  “it is possible we won’t 100 percent match maturity for maturity,” she said. the budget counts on $50.3 million in revenue growth, $19.35 million in spending cuts, as well as other measures to address a $114.2 million structural gap and more than $87 million in new spending for additional police hires and reforms.

markets have rallied for months on hopes that  washington would provide significant tax cuts for corporations.  celebrating their senate victory, republican leaders predicted the tax cuts would encourage u.s. companies to invest more and boost economic growth.  “we have an opportunity now to make america more competitive, to keep jobs from being shipped offshore and to provide substantial relief to the middle class,” said mitch mcconnell, the republican leader in the senate. the senate approved their bill in a 51 49 vote, with democrats complaining that last minute amendments to win over skeptical republicans were poorly drafted and vulnerable to being gamed later. “the republicans have managed to take a bad bill and make it worse,” said senate democratic leader chuck schumer. “under the cover of darkness and with the aid of haste, a flurry of last minute changes will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations.” no democrats voted for the bill, but they were unable to  block it because republicans hold a 52 48 senate majority. talks will begin, likely next week, between the senate and the house, which already has approved its own version of the legislation, to reconcile their respective bills.  trump, who predicted that the negotiations would produce “something beautiful,” wants that to happen before the end of the year. this would allow him and his republicans to score their first major legislative achievement of 2017 after having controlled the white house, the senate and the house since he took office in january. republicans failed in their efforts to repeal the obamacare healthcare law over the summer and trump’s presidency has been hit by white house in fighting and a federal investigation into possible collusion last year between his election campaign team and russian officials.  the tax overhaul is seen by trump and republicans as crucial to their prospects at mid term elections in november 2018, when they will have to defend their majorities in congress.  in a legislative battle that moved so fast a final draft of the bill was unavailable to the public until just hours before the vote, democrats slammed the proposed tax cuts as a give away to businesses and the rich financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt. the framework for both the senate and house bills was developed in secret over a few months by a half dozen republican congressional leaders and trump advisers, with little input from the party’s rank and file and none from democrats. six republican senators, who wanted and got last minute amendments and whose votes had been in doubt, said on friday they would back the bill and did so. senator bob corker, one of few remaining republican fiscal hawks who pledged early on to oppose any bill that expanded the federal deficit, was the lone republican dissenter. “i am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that ... could deepen the debt burden on future generations,” said corker, who is not running for re election. numerous last minute changes were made to the bill on friday and in the early morning hours of saturday. one was to make state and local property tax deductible up to $10,000, mirroring the house bill. the senate previously had proposed entirely ending state and local tax deductibility. “the tax reform measure that passed the senate is negative overall for state and local government finances. lower federal tax rates for businesses and individuals could result in a modest boost to hiring and consumption, positively affecting state and local revenues,” nick samuels, vice president at moody’s investors service, said in a statement. “however, the change to the state and local tax (salt) deduction would reduce disposable income for many taxpayers, likely outweighing the positive effect of lower federal rates on consumption in many communities and states.” in another change, the alternative minimum tax (amt), both for individuals and corporations, would not be repealed in full. instead, the individual amt would be adjusted and the corporate amt would be maintained as is, lobbyists said. another change would put a five year limit on letting businesses immediately write off the full value of new capital investments. that would phase out over four years starting in year six, rather than be permanent as initially proposed. under the bill, the corporate tax rate would be permanently slashed to 20 percent from 35 percent, while future foreign profits of u.s. based firms would be largely exempt, both changes pursued by corporate lobbyists for years. on the individual side, the top tax rate paid by the highest income earners would be cut slightly. the tax policy center, a nonpartisan think tank, analyzed an earlier but broadly similar version of the bill passed by the senate tax committee on nov. 16 and found it would reduce taxes for all income groups in 2019 and 2025, with the largest average tax cuts going to the highest income americans. two republican senators announced their support for the bill on friday after winning more tax relief for non corporate pass through businesses. these include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations, ranging from mom and pop concerns to large financial and real estate groups. the bill now features a 23 percent tax deduction for such business owners, up from the original 17.4 percent. the senate bill would gut a section of obamacare by repealing a fee paid by some americans who do not buy health insurance, a step critics said would undermine the obamacare system and raise insurance premiums for the sick and the old. senator susan collins, a moderate republican, said she obtained commitments from republican leaders that steps would be taken later in separate legislation to minimize the impact of the repeal of the “individual mandate” fee.

" iran accused france on friday of fuelling tension in the middle east by taking a  biased  stance on tehran s regional policy, and president emmanuel macron said tehran misunderstood its  balanced  position.     it seems that france has a biased view toward the ongoing crises and humanitarian catastrophes in the middle east,  foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi was quoted as saying by state tv.  this view fuels regional conflicts, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  french foreign minister jean yves le drian said on thursday france was worried about iran s involvement in the middle east crisis and its disputed ballistic missile program.   iran s role and the different areas where this country operates worries us,  le drian told a joint news conference with his saudi counterpart adel jubeir in riyadh.  i am thinking in particular of iran s interventions in regional crises, this hegemonic temptation and i m thinking of its ballistic program,  he said. iran has repeatedly rejected france s call for talks on its missile program, saying it is defensive and unrelated to its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers. asked at an eu summit in gothenburg about iran s accusations, macron said tehran misunderstood france s  balanced  position of talking to everyone and not taking sides between sunni and shi ite muslims.  our wish is that iran has a less aggressive strategy in the region and that we can clarify its ballistic missile strategy which seems to be uncontrolled,  he said.  iran is a power that we wish to have a dialogue with and that we will continue to talk to.  paris suggested this week that new european union sanctions against iran could be discussed over its missile tests. but eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini seemed to dismiss that idea on tuesday. shi ite dominated iran and its regional arch rival sunni saudi arabia are involved in proxy wars across the region, backing opposite sides in syria, yemen, iraq and lebanon. jubeir told reuters on thursday that the kingdom s actions in the middle east were a response to what he called the  aggression  of iran. qasemi said jubeir was repeating baseless claims, the state news agency irna reported on friday.   saudi arabia s foreign minister s gestures and his blame game will definitely not reduce the responsibility of this country in undermining the regional stability and security,  qasemi said.

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, steven mnuchin, has pledged to divest at least $94 million worth of investments in 43 entities to avoid conflicts of interest, according to an ethics agreement released on wednesday. mnuchin said in a 42 page financial disclosure report that these investments include more than $50 million worth of common shares of cit group inc, the financial services group that acquired his onewest bank in 2015. however, his cit shares are likely worth more. they are listed in the “over $50 million” category, the highest amount required on the asset valuation form for presidential political appointees. the investor group he led sold onewest in 2015 for $3.4 billion, seven years after they purchased the assets of failed mortgage lender indymac bank for $1.55 billion. mnuchin, a former goldman sachs executive and hollywood film financier, added that he resigned his position as a cit director in december as part of his agreement with the treasury’s assistant general counsel. he pledged to divest goldman sachs shares worth over $5 million and goldman sachs treasury investments worth over $25 million. the disclosure forms, which allow a range for the value of assets, reveal that mnuchin is worth at least $118 million to around $392 million, making him he richest treasury secretary since his former boss, ex goldman sachs ceo henry paulson, who served under george w. bush and was worth over $700 million at the time he took office in 2006. by contrast, president barack obama’s treasury secretaries, tim geithner and jack lew, were each worth between about $740,000 and $1.7 million when they took office. under mnuchin’s ethics agreement, he will refrain from any decisions involving cit group until august 2018, when a final payment of at least $5 million from cit group is made as part off a “holdback” agreement related to the onewest merger.  among other assets disclosed by mnuchin are a small airplane he operates for business and personal use, and an interest in a 1978 willem de kooning oil painting, “untitled iii”, valued between $5 million and $25 million. mnuchin also said in his ethics agreement that prior to or upon senate confirmation he would fully disclose the assets of his fiancée, scottish born actress louise linton, as if they were married and pledged to refrain from any matter that affects her finances. the documents are on file with the office of government ethics.

" the financially distressed city of scranton, pennsylvania, will soon sell its public sewer utility to a subsidiary of american water works company inc. for $195 million, a city official said on tuesday. the deal would mark another step forward in the city’s efforts to stabilize its budget. an old steel and coal town known as the electric city and as the setting for the television series “the office,” scranton’s finances have been under state oversight since 1992. the city’s previous administration made headlines in 2012 when it cut police and firefighter pay to minimum wage for two weeks because it could not make payroll.     “without this deal the city wouldn’t have been able to survive, financially anyway,” mayor william courtright said late 9on monday in televised remarks on the sewer utility sale. the scranton sewer authority’s board authorized the sale to pennsylvania american water late on monday, city solicitor jason a. shrive told reuters. before the transaction can close, it needs governmental approvals from state public utility regulators and state and federal environmental protection agencies. the deal is expected to save the city $350 million over 30 years, plus another $140 million the authority must spend on environmental mediation under a consent decree. ratepayers will likely see their rates increase on average 1.9 percent per year for the next 10 years, shrive said, compared to 4.5 to 5 percent every year for the next 30 years if there were no sale.  that amounts to $7,600 of savings total for each ratepayer over the next three decades, shrive said. a spokeswoman for pennsylvania american water, which already owns scranton’s drinking water system, declined to comment. nationally, american water expanded its customer base in 2015 by nearly 42,000 customers, with just over half of those coming from acquisitions that closed that year, according to a transcript of the company’s fourth quarter earnings call in february. earlier this month, scranton city officials also disclosed details of a $31.5 million deal to pay off a long overdue labor award inherited from the previous administration. the city will pay about $29.3 million in back pay to police and firefighters, including retirees, and put a total of $1.59 million into the city’s public pension funds. these steps, combined with a planned long term lease of the city’s parking authority that could be finalized by june, could get the city out of the state oversight program for distressed cities by the end of 2017, shrive said.

" cameroon has broken international law by forcibly deporting at least 100,000 nigerians who had fled there to escape islamist boko haram militants, human rights watch (hrw) said on wednesday. cameroon s minister of communications declined to comment on the report, which said the army had been detaining the refugees and torturing some of them, before the authorities pushed them back into neighboring northeast nigeria. human rights watch said the expulsions reported since 2015 were one of the largest illegal forced repatriations it had seen in recent years, and were in  flagrant breach  of global and cameroonian law. boko haram militants have killed tens of thousands in their fight to carve out an islamist state in northeast nigeria. the violence has forced hundreds of thousands to flee, many across the border into cameroon, chad and niger.      cameroon s army has been aggressively screening newly arriving nigerians at the border, subjecting some to torture and other forms of abuse, and containing them in far flung and under serviced border villages,  the report said.  this policy of blocking asylum seekers from accessing protection has made it easier for cameroon to deport them,  it said, adding that the u.n. refugee agency (unhcr) has been denied access. the unhcr said the report was broadly in line with its own understanding of the situation, though it could not confirm all the details in the paper.  forced returns in any context are of serious concern to us and in the case of cameroon and nigeria we have raised these concerns repeatedly and publicly,  said a unhcr spokesman. cameroon signed a treaty in march with nigeria and the unhcr to ensure that all refugee returns are voluntary but the rights group said cameroon s violations had continued.  they humiliated us like animals and beat us like we were slaves,  the report quoted one refugee as saying. his brother died from the resulting internal bleeding, he added. some deportees, including children, were so malnourished or sick they did not survive their return to nigeria, said hrw. nigeria is struggling to cope with millions of people dependent on emergency relief for food, shelter and medicine, victims of an eight year conflict in which at least 20,000 have been killed. at least 10.7 million people are in need of assistance in the region, mainly in nigeria but also in chad, niger and cameroon, according to the united nations.

" donald trump’s nominee to head the department of homeland security told a u.s. senate committee on wednesday there was no need to build a wall on the mexican border “from sea to shining sea” in remarks that contrasted with the president’s campaign pledge. kirstjen nielsen repeated at her confirmation hearing what her predecessor, john kelly, had said about the project. kelly, nielsen’s former boss, stepped down as head of the department this year to be trump’s chief of staff. building a wall along the u.s. mexico border was one of trump’s central campaign promises but so far only prototypes have been built as funding remains in question.  nielsen, 45, served as kelly’s deputy in the white house and before that as his chief of staff when he was secretary of homeland security in the opening months of trump’s presidency. in response to questions from senators on the homeland security committee, nielsen said she would work with “state and local actors on the ground” to find the best solutions for border security, including increasing the use of technology such as unmanned surveillance aircraft. the ranking democrat on the committee, senator claire mccaskill, raised concerns that no cost benefit analysis had been done on the need for the wall as compared to other homeland security initiatives facing cuts in the president’s budget. “these decisions shouldn’t be based on politics,” mccaskill said at the hearing. nielsen responded that any decision about resources needed to be “risk based.”  if confirmed by the senate, nielsen would take the reins at a department with more than 240,000 employees that is responsible for issues such as u.s. border and airport security, immigration policy, disaster response and refugee admissions. she is a cyber security expert and highlighted those concerns in her opening remarks. “cyber criminals and nation states are continually looking for ways to exploit our hyperconnectivity,” nielsen said. a day before the hearing a bipartisan group of dozens of former u.s. homeland security officials sent letters supporting her nomination. nielsen served in the administration of republican president george w. bush as special assistant to the president for homeland security and was involved in revising disaster relief policies after hurricane katrina in 2005. when asked by another democratic senator whether she believed humans were the primary cause of climate change, which scientists have linked to worsening natural disasters, nielsen said: “i do absolutely believe that the climate is changing and that there are many contributions”.

" russia said on friday it would respond harshly to any u.s. measures designed to hurt it, a day after the united states told moscow to close its san francisco consulate and buildings in washington and new york. the warning, from foreign minister sergei lavrov, came as russia said it was weighing a response to the u.s. move that will force it to shutter two trade missions in the united states as well as the san francisco consulate by sept. 2. “we’ll react as soon as we finish our analysis,” lavrov told students in moscow. “we will respond harshly to things that damage us.” separately, a top kremlin aide complained the u.s. demarche pushed bilateral ties further into a blind alley and fuelled a spiral of tit for tat retaliatory measures. u.s. president donald trump took office in january, saying he wanted to improve u.s. russia ties which were at a post cold war low. but since then, ties have frayed further after u.s. intelligence officials said russia had meddled in the presidential election, something moscow denies.  trump, himself battling allegations his associates colluded with russia, grudgingly signed new sanctions on moscow into law this month which had been drawn up by congress. when it became clear those measures would become law, moscow ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half, to 455 people. lavrov hinted on friday that russia might look at ordering further reductions in u.s. embassy staff, suggesting moscow had been generous last time by allowing washington to keep “more than 150” extra people. he said russia had cut the u.s. numbers to tally with the number of russian diplomats in the united states, but that moscow had generously included more than 150 russian staff who work at russia’s representation office at the united nations. lavrov said moscow still hoped for better relations and blamed trump’s political foes for the deteriorating situation.       “i want to say that this whole story with exchanging tit for tat sanctions was not started by us,” lavrov said.  “it was started by the obama administration to undermine u.s. russia relations and to not allow trump to advance constructive ideas or fulfil his pre election pledges.” barack obama, then outgoing president, expelled 35 suspected russian spies in december and seized two russian diplomatic compounds. president vladimir putin paused before responding, saying he would wait to see how trump handled russia.  “we thought this administration could exercise common sense,  but unfortunately the russophobes in congress are not allowing it to,” said lavrov, who complained that the united states had only given moscow 48 hours to comply with its latest demands.

" companies should not blame u.s. sanctions for stopping them investing in iran, a state department official told businesses on wednesday, saying there were many other risks putting off would be investors. the united states and europe lifted sanctions in january under a deal with tehran to limit its nuclear program, but u.s. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue remain, banning dollar transactions with iran and making it harder for companies to access finance for business in the islamic republic. jarrett blanc, the state department’s deputy lead coordinator of last year’s nuclear deal, said companies should tell their iranian partners that it was not just those remaining sanctions that were holding up business deals. “many times, in the past 100 days, we have found international firms who have said to iran: ‘only u.s. sanctions are preventing you from doing business’,” blanc told 400 people at a forum for european business with iran in zurich. “but when we dig a little deeper, and seek to answer questions about precisely your concerns, it turns out that your business decisions, not surprisingly, in fact take into account concerns well beyond sanctions.”  iran has signed billions of dollars of deals with european firms since the nuclear sanctions were lifted, including a $27 billion aircraft order from airbus. but deals requiring investment inside iran have moved slowly. ayatollah ali khamenei, the most powerful figure in iran, has blamed the delays squarely on the united states. “the u.s. treasury ... acts in such a way that big corporations, big institutions and big banks do not dare to come and deal with iran,” khamenei said in march. iranian businesses at the zurich forum said european banks were staying away due to u.s. pressure, and said that could put european companies at a disadvantage to their asian competitors. “they are going to lose opportunities soon,” majid ghassemi, president of bank pasargad, told reuters. “it is against the benefits of european investors, this kind of barrier that the americans have put up against the banking system in europe.” parviz akbaroff, international business manager at infrastructure consulting company rah shahr, said european firms had “become subservient to u.s. interests”. while the united states does not prohibit foreign banks from doing business with iran, many are wary after facing multi billion dollar fines during the sanctions era.  nonetheless, lawyers and consultants have consistently warned would be investors of a wide range of other risks including complex regulations, unclear dispute mechanisms, labor issues, and corruption. blanc said investors who acknowledge these concerns privately should communicate them to their iranian partners. “don’t take the easy way out, by just saying ‘u.s. sanctions, u.s. sanctions, u.s. sanctions’,” he said.

" russia s vladimir putin won the backing of turkey and iran on wednesday to host a syrian peace congress, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end a civil war all but won by moscow s ally, president bashar al assad. syrian opposition groups, meeting in saudi arabia to seek a unified position ahead of peace talks, decided to stick to their demand that assad leave power, al arabiya television reported, following speculation they might soften their stance after their hardline leader quit. two days after being visited by assad in the black sea resort of sochi, president putin hosted his counterparts tayyip erdogan and hassan rouhani there.  in a joint statement, the three leaders called on the syrian government and moderate opposition to  participate constructively  in the planned congress, to be held in the same city on a date they did not specify.  the congress will look at the key questions on syria s national agenda,  putin told reporters at the summit, sitting alongside rouhani and erdogan.  first of all that is the drawing up of a framework for the future structure of the state, the adoption of a new constitution, and, on the basis of that, the holding of elections under united nations supervision.  there was no word from the leaders on who would be invited. the list of invitees has been a sticking point, with turkey objecting to some syrian kurdish groups attending. syria s civil war, in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes. all previous efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution have swiftly collapsed, with the opposition demanding assad leave power, the government insisting he stay on, and neither side able to force the issue by achieving a military victory. but since russia joined the war on behalf of assad in 2015, the balance of power has turned decisively in his government s favor. a year ago, the army forced rebels out of their last urban stronghold, the eastern half of aleppo. in recent weeks, the self proclaimed caliphate of jihadist group islamic state has collapsed. government forces now effectively control all of syria apart from a few shrinking rebel pockets and a swathe in the north held by mainly kurdish forces backed by the united states. opposition groups held their meeting on wednesday at a luxury hotel in riyadh, two days after the leader of the high negotiations committee (hnc) that has represented them at previous peace talks quit abruptly. hnc chief riyad hijab had been known as an uncompromising defender of the position that assad must have no role in any political transition for syria, and his resignation had led to speculation the opposition could soften its stance. however, a draft of the meeting s final statement still included the demand assad leave office at the start of any transition, saudi owned al arabiya television reported. having helped assad s government reach the cusp of victory, putin now appears to be playing the leading role in international efforts to end the war on assad s terms.  in addition to hosting assad, rouhani and erdogan, the russian leader has also phoned u.s. president donald trump and saudi king salman in the past 24 hours. iran has long supported assad.  saudi arabia, iran s arch rival in the middle east and long a backer of rebel groups in syria and advocate of the position that assad must leave, has been the main supporter of the hnc. but after king salman made an historic visit to moscow a few months ago, riyadh appears to have come around to russia s dominant role in syria. similarly turkey, traditionally one of the syrian leader s implacable foes, has increasingly shown willingness to work with russia to resolve the crisis.  this summit is aimed at results. i believe critical decisions will be reached,  turkey s erdogan said in sochi before his meeting with putin and rouhani. the syrian government welcomed the final statement from the three way iran summit, syrian state media said on wednesday, quoting an official source in the foreign ministry. it described it as the culmination of assad s summit with putin. the other major power with troops in syria, the united states, has so far kept its distance. washington has been arming, training and sending special forces to assist a kurdish group fighting against islamic state, angering turkey which is fighting its own kurdish insurgency. still, any final settlement that keeps assad in power will probably require the participation of some kind of opposition delegation willing to negotiate over the demand that he go. u.n. peace talks mediator staffan de mistura, host of the formal peace process in geneva, told the opposition groups at the riyadh meeting they needed to have the  hard discussions  necessary to reach a  common line .  a strong, unified team is a creative partner in geneva and we need that, one who can actually explore more than one way to arrive to the goals that we need to have,  he said. de mistura will meet russia s defense and foreign ministers on thursday to discuss preparations for a new round of geneva talks, russian news agency ria reported. russia said on tuesday that the resignation of such  radically minded  syrian opposition figures as hnc chief hijab would help unite the disparate opposition factions around a more  realistic  platform.

" president elect donald trump’s nominee to head the u.s. department of health and human services defended his stock holdings and proposals to dismantle obamacare on wednesday, saying americans would not suddenly lose health insurance. representative tom price told the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, one of two that oversee the health department, that there was no connection between his purchase of certain health company stocks and his promotion of legislation that would have helped the companies. he said the stocks were bought on his behalf by a broker. “i had no knowledge of those purchases,” he said. price owns a variety of healthcare stocks, including biotech firm amgen inc, pharma companies bristol myers squibb co, eli lilly & co and drug distributor mckesson corp. he has said he will divest health and other stocks that could be affected by his position as health secretary. price, an orthopedic surgeon, said he did personally direct his broker to buy shares of australian biotech company innate immunotherapeutics ltd. he said he was made aware of the stock by republican congressman chris collins, who serves on immunotherapeutics’ board, but denied he had been given any inside information or broken any laws. he said he did his own due diligence on the company. a spokesman for collins, michael mcadams, said in a statement that collins’ relationship with immunotherapeutics goes back more than 15 years, during which he has spoken with hundreds of people, including price. “congressman collins has never disclosed any nonpublic or improper information related to innate immunotherapeutics and has followed all ethical and legal standards required by the house of representatives during his time in office.” senator patty murray, the top democrat on the panel, said the purchase raised questions that need a full investigation before the senate goes forward with his confirmation. stephen crimmins, an attorney with murphy and mcgonigle and former lawyer with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, said the chain of events described by price does not suggest insider trading. “what we’re seeing so far is a tip from a company director, who happened to be another congressman,” crimmins said. “it’s a tip that the company was a good investment based on its ongoing public research on multiple sclerosis. that’s not insider trading, whether price bought in the market or in a private placement.” crimmins said the controversy illustrates the risk that all public officials take when they invest in individual stocks. “the safe play to avoid such questions is to stick to fund investments,” he said. not everyone is as sanguine as crimmins. james cox, a securities law professor at duke university school of law, said price appeared to have received the information about immunotherapeutics by virtue of his public position. “what i heard and thought he admitted to doing was abusing his position by using information that was not generally publicly available for private gain,” he said. price will face additional questioning the senate committee on finance, which has set a confirmation hearing for jan. 24.    only members of the finance committee will vote on whether to send price’s nomination to the senate floor for review. questioned about president obama’s signature affordable care act, price said “nobody is interested in pulling the rug out from anyone” as republicans in congress work to repeal the law and replace it with an alternative system. price said an overhaul of obamacare will initially focus on individual health plans sold on online exchanges and the medicaid program but would not tackle changes to medicare.     trump has called for the immediate repeal of the law and its simultaneous replacement. trump has said that he wants to keep some aspects of obamacare, such as allowing young adults to be on their parents’ insurance, but that he wants plans that use health savings accounts. he also advocates for insurance to be sold across state lines. price said that with these new tools, and the rollout of new forms of high deductible so called catastrophic insurance, the government can expand healthcare coverage to more people. he also echoed trump’s recent call for “healthcare for all,” saying that he wants more people to be covered after the aca is repealed. the nonpartisan congressional budget office on tuesday said a repeal of obamacare would increase the number of people without health insurance by 18 million in the first year and 32 million by the year 2026.

" republican presidential candidate marco rubio voiced regret on wednesday about making personal attacks against front runner donald trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the new york billionaire’s momentum.rubio, trump, ohio governor john kasich and u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, the four remaining republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of fox news sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on thursday in miami. rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with trump. he called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. until rubio got personal, the u.s. senator from florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on trump from a policy standpoint. he told fox news’ “the kelly file” that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently. “my kids were embarrassed by it. my wife didn’t like it. i don’t think it reflects good. that’s not who i am. that’s not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again,” rubio said. “i’d do it differently – on the personal stuff. i’m not telling you he didn’t deserve it, but that’s not who i am and that’s not what i want to be,” he added. rubio, 44, fared poorly when michigan, mississippi, idaho and hawaii voted on tuesday. he needs to win his home state of florida next tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race. he said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind trump in florida were not accurate. “the fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one they’ll take on tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and we’re going to win in florida,” he said. cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main trump alternative should rubio and kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues. “i don’t have any views on donald trump’s anatomy,” cruz said at his fox news town hall. kasich, at his fox news town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of ohio on tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in cleveland in july. a contested convention would result if trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as kasich, 63. president gerald ford and challenger ronald reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 republican national convention, but no republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since thomas dewey’s third ballot win in 1948.  trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream republicans for his statements on muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his fox news town hall he had attracted many new voters to the republican party with his crossover appeal. he said establishment republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning. “they would be so foolish to throw it away,” he told host sean hannity.

" north korea, which conducted a fourth nuclear test in january in contravention of u.n. security council resolutions, can learn from a deal struck between iran and world powers to freeze its nuclear program, u.s. deputy secretary of state antony blinken said on tuesday. north korea, which regularly threatens the united states and rich, democratic south korea, also conducted a long range rocket launch in february, defying u.n. sanctions. the security council last month expanded those sanctions aimed at starving north korea of funds for its weapons program on a resolution drafted by the united states and china. “iran made a fundamental choice. it decided to freeze and roll back its nuclear program and allow inspectors to come in and create the time and space to see if we could agree a comprehensive agreement,” blinken told reporters in seoul. iran and six world powers clinched the nuclear agreement in july 2015, which allowed for the easing of sanctions imposed by the united states, european union and united nations in return for tehran curbing its nuclear program.     “it’s our hope that the dprk will be inspired by that example,” said blinken, speaking after a meeting with his japanese and south korean counterparts. dprk stands for democratic people’s republic of korea, north korea’s official title.   recent diplomatic progress between the united states and cuba and myanmar demonstrated u.s. willingness to engage with countries like north korea, blinken said. “if a country, even one with which we’ve had the most profound differences, is prepared to engage seriously and credibly in answering the demands of the international community, we are also prepared to engage,” blinken said. blinken said on monday the united states would respond strongly in the case of a further north korean nuclear test, days after the north’s failed attempt to launch what the united states believes was an intermediate range ballistic missile.

" iran has suggested to six world powers that it may be open to talks about its ballistic missile arsenal, seeking to reduce tension over the disputed programme, iranian and western officials familiar with the overtures told reuters.  tehran has repeatedly vowed to continue building up what it calls defensive missile capability in defiance of western criticism, with washington saying the islamic republic s stance violates its 2015 nuclear deal with the powers. but the sources said that given u.s. president donald trump s threats to ditch the deal reached under his predecessor barack obama, tehran had approached the powers recently about possible talks on some  dimensions  of its missile programme.  during their meeting on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly last month, iran told members of the (world powers) that it could discuss the missile programme to remove concerns,  an iranian source with knowledge of the meeting told reuters on condition of anonymity. u.s. and western officials did not confirm the matter was discussed at the zarif tillerson meeting. but two u.s. officials said iran had recently been  keeping it alive  by feeding certain media reports and via third parties such as oman. a former u.s. defense department official said iran s overtures had reached washington in recent weeks.  iran has put feelers out saying it is willing to discuss its ballistic missile programme and is using contacts ...  officials who were  holdovers  from the obama administration,  the former official said.  iran s reported approach came after trump called the nuclear accord  an embarrassment  and  the worst deal ever negotiated . he is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official said on thursday.  such a step could unravel the breakthrough agreement   seen by supporters as crucial to forestalling a middle east arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits iran s ability to enrich uranium in exchange for sanctions relief. the other five powers are britain, france, germany, russia and china, all of whom have reaffirmed commitment to the deal. iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif met his counterparts from the six powers, including u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson for the first time, on the fringes of the u.n. gathering on sept. 20.  the americans expressed their worries about iran s missile capability and zarif said in reply that the programme could be discussed, the iranian source told reuters.  a u.s. official with first hand knowledge of dealings with the islamic republic said zarif had been recycling offers that  have been lying dormant on the table for some time.  zarif knows that if trump goes ahead and decertifies iran, it (iran) will be on the high ground, and the u.s. will be isolated among the (six powers),  the official said.  iran s foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi said on friday tehran s ballistic missile programme was for defence purposes only and non negotiable.  iran has in all bilateral diplomatic meetings, including the recent visit of ... zarif to new york, emphasised that its defensive missile programme is not negotiable,  qasemi was quoted as saying by iranian media.  the u.s. mission at the united nations referred reuters to the u.s. state department for comment. the state department declined to comment on whether possible talks on missiles were addressed at the meeting or whether iran had recently communicated such interest. but it said washington remained committed to  countering the full range of threats the iranian regime poses to the u.s., our allies, and regional stability, including its ballistic missile development . the trump administration has imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran, saying its missile tests violate the u.n. resolution that formalised the nuclear deal. it calls on tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs.  iran says it has no such plans and denies breaching the resolution. iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programmes in the middle east, viewing it as an essential precautionary defence against the united states and other adversaries, primarily gulf arab states and israel. a senior iranian official, who also asked not to be named, said pragmatist president hassan rouhani, zarif and revolutionary guards commanders have had several meetings with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, who has the last say on all iranian policy, to secure his backing for missile talks.  the leader was not optimistic during the meetings because he does not trust americans. others argued that the heightening tension over the missile programme could be resolved through talks,  said the official, involved in backroom negotiations. any talks would not aim to end or suspend iran s missile programme but to  negotiate some dimensions of it, like limiting production of some missiles with specific ranges , he said.  diplomacy worked well in ending the nuclear stand off ... the dispute over the missile programme also can be resolved through talks,  the official said. a third iranian official said tehran would be willing to discuss long range missiles. he did not elaborate.   a u.s. official with extensive experience negotiating with iran said  putting this out there publicly as zarif has done puts pressure on the (trump) administration . a western official said the administration had assessed zarif s approach to be  a stalling tactic by tehran . another western official said iran must present concrete details for missile talks:  what will need to be seen are the specifics on load capability, the distance range of missiles and how many kilograms can a missile warhead carry.   when asked if iran appeared willing to negotiate on its missile programme, a french diplomat said:  we talk about everything with them, including the ballistic programme.   our objective is that this leads to concrete acts. on the ballistic issue they repeat that it s all defensive and has nothing to do with nuclear.

" donald trump’s chances of winning the republican nomination for the white house shot to a record high at online betting sites around the world on wednesday after his latest victory in voting in nevada. betting venues in britain, ireland and new zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around trump, once considered a rank outsider attracting long shot odds of 200/1. following his double digit margin win in nevada’s republican caucuses on tuesday, his third victory in the first four early nominating contests, odds have tightened all the way to 1/2 in some cases. “mr trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender,” said graham sharpe from william hill, adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if trump was elected to the white house on nov. 8.  william hill and betway make trump 1/2 favorite to get the republican nod, while ladbrokes cut his odds to 4/9, the same as those shown on ireland’s paddypower. his nearest rival, u.s. senator marco rubio from florida, featured odds of 6/1 on ladbrokes. u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, who has been battling with rubio for the no. 2 spot in the early voting states, has sunk to a deep longshot. paddy power gives cruz odds of 33/1, its site shows. bettors also markedly cut the odds on trump becoming president, although he still trails democratic front runner hillary clinton, who won nevada’s democratic caucuses on saturday. jessica bridge from ladbrokes said trump was on a roll heading into super tuesday on march 1, when several u.s. states hold nominating contests. on predictit, a site operated by victoria university in wellington, new zealand, trump’s chances of winning the republican nod were the highest since it started tracking the race in october 2015.  a trump bet there, on a scale of $0.00 to $1, stood at 72 cents, up 4 cents, while rubio tumbled 7 cents to 24 cents and cruz sank a penny to 4 cents, matching a record low.

" seattle financial worker harrison karlewicz had been considering joining an environmental activist group for a while. the day after donald trump won the white house, he signed up. “that was a big push for me, kind of a wakeup call,” the 25 year old said, after joining 350 seattle, a group that stages mass protests against fossil fuel use. “i thought, ‘i don’t feel involved. i want to get out there.’” during his campaign, trump said global warming was a hoax and called for the environmental protection agency to be gutted. he promised to “cancel” the paris climate agreement between the united states and nearly 200 other countries to slow climate change, and he pledged to revive the coal industry. karlewicz represents what environmental activists say is the silver lining of trump’s electoral victory: environmentally minded people angered by the outcome are rallying to their cause. at 350 seattle, people packed a volunteer drop in meeting  after news of trump’s confirmed win, said organizer emily johnston. the group blocked a rail line in washington state that transports oil to shell and tesoro refineries earlier this year.      “this was surprising to me, because i personally was so shaken that i felt practically paralyzed, and i know many other people did, too,” johnston said. “the fact that many others responded by immediately engaging is incredibly heartening.” jay o’hara, a vermont based climate change activist with the climate disobedience center and a mastermind behind a coal shipment blockade in 2013 that spurred more radical fossil fuel activism, said trump’s win represents an opportunity for environmentalists to focus on a clear enemy. “in some ways, it can almost be seen as a relief,” he said of trump’s win. “we are going to have a real fight here, or maybe an actual argument.” johnston, of 350 seattle, who camped for a week at north dakota’s standing rock sioux reservation to protest pipeline construction, said that protesters would continue to take advantage of the vulnerability of energy infrastructure. “all these pipelines, all these tankers, all these trains have to go through thousands of miles” and could be potential protest targets, she said. some of the well established national environmental organizations that helped draft the obama administration’s environmental initiatives, like the clean power plan to curb carbon dioxide emissions, will be shifting to a defensive posture under trump’s leadership. “we’ll be in the congress, in the courts, in the boardrooms and in the streets,” said gene karpinski, president of the washington based league of conservation voters, which backed trump’s democratic rival hillary clinton and spent over $45 million to support candidates in the 2016 elections. karpinski said he expected legal action to prevent trump from following through on his agenda.  trump has appointed myron ebell, a known climate skeptic, to guide the reshaping of the epa, and trump energy adviser kevin cramer, a u.s. representative from north dakota, said trump is likely to target the clean power plan and waters of the united states rules during his first 100 days in office. dan farber, an environmental law professor at the university of california, berkeley school of law, said the best that advocates for climate change action could hope for from  courts is to “play successful defense against an anti environmental onslaught” from the new administration.     “it’s a fairly grim situation,” he added. several groups also said they would put a greater focus on state level environmental initiatives to sidestep trump’s administration.  the sierra club, which is headquartered in california, said it would push ahead with its beyond coal campaign, which has led to the retirement of hundreds of coal plants since it was launched more than a decade ago. the campaign mobilizes local activists and lawyers to push utilities and state regulators to shutter older plants and replace them with renewable energy.  “clearly, we are going to have to fight and resist the worst impulses of the next administration,” said michael brune, sierra club’s executive director. “but we are also mindful that despite all odds, we were able to make great progress during the bush administration and we hope to do it again.” ",0
" president elect donald trump rejected as “ridiculous” u.s. intelligence reports that russia intervened in the presidential election on his behalf through targeted hacking, putting him at odds with top lawmakers who vowed to investigate the findings. he blamed democrats for news reports on the intelligence findings and said he did not believe they came from the central intelligence agency. “i think it’s ridiculous. i think it’s just another excuse. i don’t believe it,” trump said in an interview on “fox news sunday.”  trump’s reluctance to blame russia for interfering in the u.s. election has raised concerns among u.s. officials who fear he will go soft on moscow at a time when they are worried about its increasingly aggressive behavior on cyber attacks and in crimea, ukraine and syria. a u.s. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, harshly criticized trump’s rejection of the assessment that russian hacking was intended to boost the president elect’s prospects in the nov. 8 election. “it’s concerning that intelligence on russian actions related to the u.s. election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan,” said the u.s. intelligence official.  “the inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of u.s. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country.” the unusually harsh comment underscored the unprecedented tensions that trump has created with the intelligence community he will command even before he’s been sworn into office. two leading u.s. senate foreign policy voices from trump’s own party expressed alarm on sunday about the possibility of moscow tipping the scales in favor of an american presidential candidate and promised to begin investigating immediately. the obama white house, which has ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the 2016 election, has formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the presidential election. russian officials, who have previously vehemently denied accusations of interference in the u.s. election, were quiet. in his search for a secretary of state, trump, a new york real estate magnate, is strongly considering exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson, who has close ties with moscow and has spoken out against u.s. sanctions on russia. republican senator john mccain expressed concern about tillerson’s close relationship with russian leader vladimir putin. “that would color his approach to vladimir putin and the russian threat,” he said on sunday on cbs’ “face the nation.” a number of u.s. senators have expressed concerns about tillerson, suggesting his nomination could run into trouble in the senate. trump’s pick as national security adviser, retired army lieutenant general michael flynn, has also raised eyebrows in military circles through appearances on russia’s government run broadcaster rt, particularly at a gala last year attended by putin. but trump’s choices to lead the cia and the pentagon, u.s.  representative mike pompeo and retired marine general james mattis, are more likely to take a harsher stance on russia. u.s. intelligence agencies have told congress and president barack obama’s administration that russia has grown increasingly aggressive in syria and ukraine and has stepped up activities in cyberspace, including meddling, sometimes covertly, in european and u.s. elections. a senior u.s. intelligence official told reuters that intelligence agencies had concluded with “high confidence” that not only did their russian counterparts direct the hacking of democratic party organizations and leaders, but did so to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton.   trump questioned whether the cia was behind the reports that indicated moscow wanted him in the white house. “i think the democrats are putting it out,” he said in the fox news interview. he said the intelligence community did not agree on russian intervention. “they’re fighting among themselves. they’re not sure,” he said.  mccain was at a loss on sunday to explain trump’s repudiation of the russian meddling. “i don’t know what to make of it because it’s clear the russians interfered,” mccain said on cbs. “whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, i think that’s a subject of investigation, but the facts are stubborn things.” mccain and fellow republican senator lindsey graham joined democratic senators chuck schumer and jack reed on sunday in expressing concern over possible russian interference and said they would work together to investigate such cyber attacks. “recent reports of russian interference in our election should alarm every american,” they said in a statement. “this cannot become a partisan issue. the stakes are too high for our country.” mccain, chairman of the armed services committee, said he would have a subcommittee led by graham begin investigating the russian hacking immediately.   republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan cannot comment on classified briefings, “but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters,” spokeswoman ashlee strong said in an email. trump advisers disputed elements of the news reports, focusing particularly on a new york times story saying that intelligence officials concluded the computer systems of the republican national committee also had been hacked. the fact that material from that intrusion had not been released, the times reported, supported the conclusion that russia was trying to help trump.  “the rnc was absolutely not hacked,” the rnc chairman and incoming white house chief of staff, reince priebus, said on nbc’s “meet the press.”  trump adviser kellyanne conway said trump would not interfere with any congressional inquiry but that the president elect regarded the spate of hacking reports as part of an effort to relitigate the election.  “he absolutely respects the intelligence community,” conway said on cbs. “what he has said is laughable or ridiculous is that this was meant to elevate him to the presidency.” in the “fox news sunday” interview, trump also discussed his decision to receive the president’s daily brief, or pdb, a highly classified document that can include details of u.s. and allied covert operations, once a week, far less often than most of his predecessors. trump said a number of his top advisers received the briefing and he did not need to get the report more frequently under routine circumstances. “i don’t need to be told the same thing every day, every morning   same words. ‘sir, nothing has changed. let’s go over it again.’ i don’t need that,” he said.

" the united arab emirates is ending the mission of north korea s non resident ambassador and terminating its own envoy s services in pyongyang, its foreign ministry said in a statement on thursday carried by state news agency wam. the uae will also stop issuing new visas or company licences to north korean citizens, wam said. several thousand north korean workers reside in the u.s allied gulf region, mainly working on construction sites.  the measures... come within the context of (the uae s) obligation as a responsible member of the international community to strengthen the international will and to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile programs,  the foreign ministry said. u.s. president donald trump urged united nations member states last month to turn up the pressure on north korea to give up its nuclear weapons, using his maiden speech to the world body to address what he has said is the top global challenge. north korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the u.n. security council. in washington, the u.s. state department welcomed the uae s decision.  very happy to hear that,  state department spokesman heather nauert told reporters.  there are many countries that are taking those steps that we have asked (them) to take.      the uae announcement follows similar moves by the uae s gulf arab neighbors qatar and kuwait, which last month downgraded their ties with pyongyang and ceased issuing new visas to north korean citizens.

" cuba and the united states aim to reach new agreements on cooperation in law enforcement, health and agriculture over the coming months, a senior cuban official said on monday, as part of the former cold war foes’ drive to normalize ties. the communist ruled island and its northern neighbor reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago after decades of hostility and have since signed deals on the environment, postal services and direct flights. a bilateral commission met on monday in havana to establish a roadmap for talks over the rest of this year, which would include more high ranking official visits, said josefina vidal, head of the cuban delegation. in march, barack obama became the first sitting u.s. president in 88 years to visit cuba. “the agenda is quite ambitious,” vidal told a news conference, adding that talks about intellectual property rights were also in the cards. the two sides had discussed holding dialogues on human rights and claims, the u.s. embassy in cuba said in a statement. they already outlined their respective claims late last year, with the u.s. seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties and cuba demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the u.s. trade embargo and other acts it described as aggression. “the united states looks forward to holding these meetings in the near future,” the embassy said. “tomorrow (we) will discuss specific steps related to bilateral security during the law enforcement dialogue.” vidal, who is the cuban foreign ministry’s chief of u.s. affairs, said the island was hopeful that whomever became next the u.s. president would continue to deepen the detente. the united states will hold a general election on nov.8. “when you look at the polls, the majority of the american population and the cuban american community are in favor of the normalization of relations,” she said. “so i expect their opinion will be taken into account.” ",0
" the u.s. senate on tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the house of representatives. by a vote of 68 29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely senate approval this week. two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the senate. meanwhile, the white house threatened to veto a $622.1 million zika bill poised to pass the house of representatives later this week, saying it was “woefully inadequate.” unlike the senate legislation, the house bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. many conservative republicans in the house refuse to approve zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while democrats and some senate republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. republican senator roy blunt from missouri told reporters that the senate measure “trimmed this package back (from obama’s request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time.” democratic senator patty murray from washington, who crafted the legislation with blunt, added, “we are going to need to keep the pressure on house republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need.” it was unclear how long it might take the senate and house to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. u.s. health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. the world health organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that zika can also cause guillain barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. last year, brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern u.s. states including florida. house republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the obama administration already shifted to zika from unused funds to battle ebola, would provide enough money through sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. the administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine. (this version of the story was corrected to say $622.1 million from $622.1 billion in the 3rd and 11th paragraphs.) ",0
" lebanon will file a complaint to the united nations against israel for violating the country s airspace and causing damage by breaking the sound barrier in the south of the country, its foreign minister said on monday.  israeli jets flew low over the southern city of saida on sunday, causing sonic booms that broke windows and shook buildings for the first time in years, lebanese security sources and residents said.      we have started preparing to file a complaint to the (u.n.) security council against israel for flying its planes at low altitude... causing material, moral and sovereign damage,  foreign minister gebran bassil said in a tweet.      prime minister saad al hariri said lebanon would issue its complaint  against israel for planting spy devices on lebanese land and continuously breaching  its airspace, his office said.  israeli warplanes regularly enter lebanon s airspace, the lebanese army says, but rarely fly so low. the israeli military gave no immediate comment. tensions have risen recently between lebanon s hezbollah and israel, which fought a month long war in 2006.      the 2006 war killed around 1,200 people in lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 israelis, most of them troops. israel has targeted iran backed hezbollah inside syria in recent years, including military leaders in several deadly strikes, but there has been no major direct confrontation.

"the washington post   nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the islamic state in iraq and syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months, due to new policies adopted by the trump administration, a senior state department official said friday.brett mcgurk, the state department s senior envoy to the anti-islamic state coalition, said that steps president trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority down from the white house to commanders in the field, have  dramatically accelerated  gains against the militants.combined islamic state losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory   78 percent of militant holdings in iraq and 58 percent in syria. about 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under trump, mcgurk said in a briefing for reporters.although the trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the islamic state, mcgurk cited  key changes  under trump. in addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.he said the 2,000 militants remaining in raqqa  most likely will die in raqqa.  the united nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.mcgurk, who held the same job in the obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the iraqi city of mosul, where u.s.-backed iraq security forces declared victory over the islamic state last month.",1

" u.s. immigration officials are planning a month long series of raids in may and june to deport hundreds of central american mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally, according to sources and an internal document seen by reuters. the operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of president barack obama this year after a similar drive over two days in january that focused on georgia, texas, and north carolina. those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women and children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from some democrats, including the party’s presidential election frontrunner hillary clinton. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) has now told field offices nationwide to launch a 30 day “surge” of arrests focused on mothers and children who have already been told to leave the united states, the document seen by reuters said. the operation would also cover minors who have entered the country without a guardian and since turned 18 years of age, the document said. two sources confirmed the details of the plan.   the exact dates of the latest series of raids were not known and the details of the operation could change.  the operation in january marked a departure for ice, part of the department of homeland security, from one off deportations to high profile raids meant to deter migrants from coming to the united states.  an ice spokeswoman said the agency does not “confirm or deny the existence of specific ongoing or future law enforcement actions.” the spokeswoman said immigrants who arrived illegally after jan. 1, 2014 are priorities for removal. federal resources were strained in 2014 under a wave of illegal migrants crossing the u.s. mexico border, especially women and children fleeing violence in honduras, el salvador, and guatemala. the planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by central american women traveling with their children.  from october 2015 through march 2016, the u.s. border patrol apprehended more than 32,000 family “units”, defined as mothers and children traveling together, for crossing illegally into the united states. over the same period in 2014 2015, there were about 14,000 such apprehensions; in 2013 2014, about 19,800. (graphic on immigration patterns of central american migrants: tmsnrt.rs/1qglgzg) many of those apprehended for unlawful entry are put into deportation proceedings in court but do not show up for their scheduled appearance before a judge or ignore court orders to leave the country. the surge in illegal border crossings has put obama in a tough spot in a presidential election year in which he wants to see a fellow democrat elected as his successor.   obama has said criminal immigrants and those who have recently entered the country are priorities for deportation. he is regularly hammered by republicans over the presence of more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.  but hispanic americans tend to vote for democrats, who are more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented. clinton raised concerns about the january raids at the time, saying they had “sown fear and division in immigrant communities.” the presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has pledged to build a wall along the mexican border to prevent illegal immigration. homeland security secretary jeh johnson told a u.s. senate panel in march that the january raids had helped to deter central americans from migrating illegally. border patrol reported fewer illegal entries between january and march 2016 compared to october and december 2015, but there were more apprehended than over the same time period in early 2015. a separate document seen by reuters said johnson was concerned about the most recent uptick in border crossings.  immigration advocates say they have asked johnson to abandon plans for future raids. “raids are not the answer,” said marielena hincapie, executive director of the national immigration law center, a legal aide and advocacy group for migrants. “this is a humanitarian challenge,” she said.

" the white house is set to unveil president donald trump’s first full budget for the 2018 fiscal year on tuesday   a plan that will include details about his proposed cuts to foreign aid and domestic spending, and his desired hikes for the military. trump will not be in town for the occasion. he embarks on his first foreign trip on friday to the middle east and europe. white house budget chief mick mulvaney revealed the date in a speech to the federalist society on thursday. the white house had released what is known as a “skinny budget” in march, trump’s first crack at a summary of his spending wishes for discretionary programs for the year that begins sept. 30. the plan drew criticism even from members of his own republican party for being too severe. republicans control both the senate and house of representatives. congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents’ budget plans. a $1.2 trillion federal spending deal for the 2017 fiscal year, passed last month, included about half of the extra military funding that trump wanted. it included some funds for border security, but no money for trump’s proposed u.s. mexico border wall.  tuesday’s full budget request will include projections for mandatory spending on programs like social security and medicare, and will include a decade’s worth of projections for spending and tax revenues, as well as economic forecasts.

" cambodian prime minister hun sen on saturday called on lawmakers from the main opposition party to defect ahead of a court ruling on whether to dissolve it, saying they could be banned from politics for five years if they left it too late. the government s move to ban the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) follows the arrest of its leader, kem sokha, on treason charges.  he rejects the charges as politically motivated ahead of next year s general election. hun sen, the world s longest serving prime minister, has held power for more than 32 years.  western countries have called for the release of kem sokha and for an end to attempts to dissolve the cnrp. hun sen said in a message to cnrp parliamentarians and local councillors, he knew not all had been involved in kem sokha s alleged treason and they should take the chance to switch to his ruling cambodian people s party (cpp).  i want to give you this opportunity to continue in your job,  he said.  it will not only be that the party is dissolved and then the matter is finished. maybe more than 100 people will be banned from politics for five years.  he said such a ban was likely to include all the cnrp s steering committee   meaning most of its members of parliament, around half of whom have fled cambodia to escape arrest. no cnrp officials were immediately available for comment. cambodia s supreme court is in theory independent of the government in ruling on the interior ministry s request for the cnrp to be banned, but hun sen has said it is  a fact  that the party will be dissolved. cambodia s parliament has already passed a law to share out elected positions to other parties if the cnrp is dissolved. most of the seats in parliament will go to minor parties while local councils, known as communes, will be taken over by the ruling party.

" democrat hillary clinton held a five percentage point lead over republican rival donald trump, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on monday, down only slightly since the fbi said last week it was reviewing new emails in its investigation of the former secretary of state. some 44 percent of likely voters said they would support clinton, while 39 percent said they would support trump, according to the oct. 26 30 survey. clinton had held a 6 point advantage over trump in the five day tracking poll last thursday. other polls have shown clinton’s lead slipping more sharply. real clear politics, which averages the results of most major polls, shows that clinton’s lead has declined from 4.6 points on friday to 2.5 points on monday.   federal bureau of investigation director james comey told congress in a letter made public on friday that his agency was looking into new emails that may be connected to clinton, who had been probed by the fbi over her use of a private server and how she handled classified information while america’s top diplomat. the fbi has revealed very little to the public about the new emails under investigation, except that they were uncovered during an unrelated investigation into the estranged husband of a top clinton aide.  in july, comey concluded that clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” with their handling of classified information, but that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges. on friday, comey told congress, “we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.”  in a separate poll that included alternative party candidates, 43 percent supported clinton, while 37 percent supported trump, 6 percent supported libertarian candidate gary johnson and 1 percent supported jill stein of the green party. the polling determines likely voters according to a number of factors including voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. it assumes that 60 percent of eligible americans will vote. the result of the 2016 election will vary greatly depending on how many voters actually cast a ballot. currently, clinton leads trump in both high and low turnout scenarios, according to the latest poll. her advantage holds at 5 points if 55 percent of eligible voters participate, and it rises to 6 points if 70 percent of americans cast a ballot. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english in all 50 states. it included 1,264 people who were considered likely voters under the assumption that 60 percent of eligible voters would participate. the poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

" a brazilian congressional report recommended on tuesday that president michel temer should not face trial for obstruction of justice and membership in a criminal organization, arguing that the charges against him were unfounded. the report by congressman bonifacio de andrada, a temer ally, also recommended shelving charges against two of his cabinet ministers stemming from a corruption case involving bribes paid by meatpacker jbs sa.  the constitutional and legal affairs committee in brazil s congress was expected to approve the report next week. the full lower house, which has the power to decide whether a president should be put on trial by the supreme court, will likely close the case a week later. that victory for temer would all but ensure that brazil s most unpopular modern day president will survive the crisis and serve out his term through the end of 2018. but fighting off the charges has seriously delayed and could derail the president s efforts to balance brazil s government accounts.  temer took office last year after the impeachment of his leftist predecessor dilma rousseff. he vowed to clean up the government in the midst of brazil s worst corruption scandal. instead he was accused of taking bribes and condoning the payment of hush money to a jailed politician in plea bargain testimony by joesley batista, an owner of jbs, the world s largest meatpacker. temer has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers argued that the case against him was flawed because it was based on one man s word and an inconclusive recording that batista secretly made of a conversation with the president. andrada said the charges were based on  bogus  plea bargain statements that do not warrant criminal prosecution.  there is no evidence of a criminal organization, but rather political activities that are being treated as criminal acts,  he said in his report that he read out to the committee. temer aides said they were confident the chamber would shelve the charges by a bigger margin than its rejection of an earlier corruption charge on august 2 by 263 227 votes, when it needed only 172 votes to throw the case out. a survey by brasilia based consultancy arko advice published this week showed that support for the government has increased in congress since august and 71 percent of the 212 lawmakers polled believe the new charges against temer would be rejected. still, it is unclear whether temer can win approval this year for his plan to overhaul the costly pension system, the key measure to reduce a bulging budget deficit that cost brazil its investment grade credit rating two years ago. a senior executive for moody s investors service said on tuesday that failure to pass pension reform would make it  easier  to decide on maintaining a negative outlook for brazil s sovereign rating early next year.

" the top u.s. intelligence officer has asked congress to drop a provision in a pending bill that would create a special committee to combat russian efforts to exert covert influence abroad, saying such a panel would duplicate current work and hinder cooperation with foreign allies. director of national intelligence james clapper laid out the objections of the u.s. intelligence community in a sept. 9 letter to the chairmen and top democrats on the house of representatives and senate intelligence committees. he charged that parts of the bill amounted to “micromanagement” of the intelligence community. the intelligence bill, an annual measure that provides broad congressional authorization for a wide range of u.s. intelligence activities and agencies, has already been approved by both intelligence committees and the house of representatives. backers in the senate are marshalling support for the bill in the hope it will be approved next week, an official familiar with the matter said. the legislation would require the creation of an interagency committee to combat russian propaganda and covert efforts to influence people, economic and political decisions in the united states and elsewhere. clapper’s letter, seen by reuters, said the panel would duplicate work already being done by intelligence agencies, and could also damage u.s. agencies’ relationships with their foreign counterparts. as a general matter, many provisions in the legislation “go well beyond oversight and into micromanagement” of the intelligence community, wrote clapper, who was appointed by outgoing democratic president barack obama. the bill would require multiple cabinet officers, including the national intelligence and fbi directors and the secretaries of state, defense, the treasury and energy, as well as the heads of the other intelligence community agencies to appoint officials to serve on the panel examining russian political interference in western politics. its main mission would be to “counter active measures by russia to exert covert influence over peoples and government by exposing falsehoods, agents of influence, corruption, human rights abuses, terrorism, and assassinations carried out by the security services or political elites of the russian federation or their proxies,” the pending legislation says.    the term “active measures” describes actions by the kgb, the soviet intelligence agency whose officers included now russian president vladimir putin. the united states and other countries have conducted similar campaigns. american and some allied intelligence agencies detected an increase in such activities in europe several years ago, and began making cooperative efforts to track and combat them, a senior u.s. intelligence official said on thursday. the escalating russian campaign started well before the hacking of u.s. political institutions, in particular of democratic party, during the 2016 presidential election campaign said the official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject matter. american officials have traced that hacking to russia, but the kremlin has denied any involvement. moscow’s campaign has included other hacking, overt and covert financing of far right and nationalist political groups, efforts to influence powerful political and economic figures, and propaganda spread by government controlled media outlets and on the internet, said u.s. and european security officials. u.s. and other intelligence analysts have concluded that the  campaign is a “well funded and coordinated effort to degrade and discredit western style democracy and sow divisions internally and within the nato alliance, directed from the highest levels of the russian government,” the senior american intelligence official said. the objections by clapper were unrelated to the incoming administration of republican president elect donald trump. clapper’s letter preceded the election on nov. 8 of trump, who has said he will seek to improve ties with moscow.

" some top chinese officials are guilty of practicing sorcery and would rather believe in gurus and western concepts of democracy than the communist party, a senior minister wrote on thursday, warning of the danger they presented to its survival. china guarantees freedom of religion for major belief systems such as buddhism, christianity and islam, but party members are meant to be atheists and are barred from what it calls superstitious practices, such as visits to soothsayers. recent years have seen several cases of officials jailed as part of president xi jinping s crackdown on corruption being accused of superstition, part of the party s efforts to blacken their names. some senior officials in leadership positions had  fallen morally , their beliefs straying from the correct path, wrote chen xi, the recently appointed head of the party s powerful organisation department that oversees personnel decisions.  some don t believe in marx and lenin but believe in ghosts and gods; they don t believe in ideals but believe in sorcery; they don t respect the people but do respect masters,  he wrote in the official people s daily, referring to spiritual leaders or gurus. people in china, especially its leaders, have a long tradition of turning to soothsaying and geomancy to find answers to their problems in times of doubt, need and chaos. the practice has grown more risky amid xi s war on graft, in which dozens of senior officials have been imprisoned. attacking officials whose faith in communism is wavering, chen said some consider it an  entirely unreal mirage , and have lost faith in socialism. instead, they look to western concepts of the separation of power and multi party systems as their ideal, added chen, who also runs the central party school that trains rising officials. he did not name any officials guilty of practicing superstition or fawning over the west. but elsewhere in the article he named some of those caught up in the most high profile recent cases, such as the feared former domestic security chief, zhou yongkang and the former party boss of chongqing, sun zhengcai, sacked for corruption in july. they were  political careerist plotters , whose cases showed that officials  political problems were no less a threat to the party than corruption, chen wrote.  the higher the position, the greater their platform, the greater the harm they caused to the party,  he added.

" iraq on sunday executed 42 sunni muslim militants convicted on terrorism charges ranging from killing members of security forces to detonating car bombs. the biggest mass execution this year in iraq came after sunni suicide attacks killed at least 60 people near the southern city of nassiriya, a shi ite area, on sept. 14, prompting shi ite demands for tougher judicial action. amnesty international criticized the move, saying on monday that  mass execution is a shocking display of the iraqi authorities  resort to the death penalty to try to show they are responding to security threats .  the death penalty is an irreversible and reprehensible punishment that should not be used in any circumstances and there is no evidence to show that it deters crime more than any other means of punishment,  amnesty said in a report. the justice ministry said on sunday the 42 had been hanged at a prison in nassiriya, three months after 14 other militants were executed following convictions for terrorism. islamic state claimed responsibility for three suicide attacks targeting restaurants and a security checkpoint near nassiriya. relatives of victims were invited to witness sunday s executions, the justice ministry said.  despite all the pain inside me after losing my two brothers in the suicide attacks, when i saw the terrorists dangling from the rope i felt relief,  said fadhil abdul ameer from nassiriya. islamic state s self declared caliphate, declared in 2014 after it captured wide areas of northern and western iraq, effectively collapsed in july when u.s. backed iraqi forces captured mosul, the group s de facto capital in iraq. but recent deadly bomb attacks in baghdad and other cities show the jihadists remain capable of guerrilla style warfare, a tactical shift away from seeking territorial conquest.

" a visa program aimed at diversifying the u.s. immigrant population came under attack from president donald trump on wednesday after he learned that the man accused of killing eight people in new york city on tuesday used it to enter the country.        sayfullo saipov, who was charged in tuesday’s truck attack, immigrated to the united states from uzbekistan in 2010 after winning a lottery enabling him to obtain a so called “diversity visa,” two government officials confirmed to reuters.  the program, established by congress and coordinated by the state department, has its roots in efforts to bring more irish and italian immigrants into the united states. citizens of countries that send relatively few immigrants to the united states can enter a lottery that grants winners permanent u.s. residency. applicants must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. just under 11.4 million applicants entered the 2016 lottery for 50,000 slots available to winners and their close family members, according to state department figures. the visa program has succeeded in diversifying the mix of immigrants that come into the united states each year, but has also drawn criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and for posing national security risks. trump said on wednesday he would ask congress to “immediately” initiate efforts to kill the program, and republican house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, who has long called for an end to diversity visas, said in a statement that they pose “a threat to the safety of our citizens.” senate democratic leader chuck schumer helped create the program in 1990 when he was a member of the house of representatives. but he was also part of a group of lawmakers in 2013 who crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done away with the program. that bill was passed by the senate but was killed by the republican led house. top congressional democrats on wednesday defended the program, saying it subjects all visa recipients “to the same stringent vetting as all other immigrant visa programs.” the only other known instance of a diversity visa beneficiary carrying out a deadly terrorist attack in the united states occurred in 2002. that year, an egyptian man who had received a diversity visa through his wife years earlier shot and killed two people in a los angeles airport. the man had earlier sought asylum in the united states but was rejected. ultimately, he was allowed to stay in the country after his wife won the lottery. as early as 2004, the state department’s then deputy inspector general, anne patterson, told congress her office believed the diversity program “contains significant vulnerabilities to national security” and that terrorists could “attempt to use it to enter the united states as permanent residents.” the agency watchdog recommended barring citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism from the program. over the years, government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes targeting the program, including extortion rackets, sham marriages and the use of fake identification documents.  in 2007, congress’s government accountability office issued a report noting that federal law enforcers “believe that some individuals, including terrorists and criminals, could use fraudulent means to enter or remain in the united states.”  the report found, however, “no documented evidence” that diversity visa immigrants “posed a terrorist or other threat.”  a september 2013 state department inspector general report found that “organized fraud rings masquerading as travel agencies” had hijacked the diversity visa program in ukraine. under the scheme, ukrainians were entered in the lottery without their consent, and then held up for money in exchange for the chance to claim a visa or encouraged to enter into sham marriages if they won.

" pope francis had an emotional meeting with muslim refugees from myanmar in bangladesh on friday and used the word rohingya to describe them for the first time on his asian trip, calling for them to be respected. he also urged the world not to ignore refugees, persecuted minorities, the poor and vulnerable. the encounter took place at an inter religious peace meeting on his first full day in bangladesh, to where 625,000 rohingya from myanmar s rakhine state have fled from an army crackdown. refugees have said scores of rohingya villages have been burnt to the ground, people killed and women raped. myanmar s military has denied accusations of  ethnic cleansing  by the united states and united nations. the pope had earlier in the week visited myanmar, where he met its leader aung san suu kyi and senior general min aung hlaing. but there he avoided using the word rohingya, a term the authorities reject. many people in myanmar regard the largely stateless rohingya as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. at the bangladesh meeting, however, he said:  the presence of god today is also called rohingya.  addressing about 5,000 people at the gathering on the grounds of the roman catholic archbishop s residence, francis said:  how much our world needs this heart to beat strongly, to counter the virus of political corruption, destructive religious ideologies, and the temptation to turn a blind eye to the needs of the poor, refugees, persecuted minorities, and those who are most vulnerable.  aid workers brought 16 rohingya refugees from camps in cox s bazar, about 430 km (260 miles) southeast of dhaka on the border with myanmar, to join other muslims, as well as hindus, buddhists, christians and charity workers. the pope looked somber as each member of the group, which included 12 men and four women, including two young girls, told him their stories through interpreters. francis looked pained as he listened.  in the name of all those who persecute you, who have persecuted you, those who have hurt you, above all for the indifference of the world, i ask for forgiveness, forgiveness.  francis said in improvised comments. before that, in his calls for peace in myanmar and bangladesh, he had not publicly used the word rohingya to describe the refugees   disappointing human rights groups and other prominent figures in the west who have condemned the repression. he had decided to follow the advice of myanmar church officials, who said his use of the word could prompt a backlash against christians and hurt myanmar s fragile path to democracy. one of the women refugees told reuters before the meeting:  myanmar military captured me and some other women, tortured us. i still bleed, there is pain in the abdomen, my back hurts, i get headaches. medicines have not helped much.    i will share my pain with him,  the woman as her young daughter clutched at her burqa garment. the pope spoke under a huge tent like canopy held up by  bamboo poles and covered with red, white and scarlet fabric to guard against the afternoon sun. he had first visited the cathedral and then was taken to the tent in a flower bedecked peddle rickshaw that a man pushed up the central aisle. in his address, francis said:  religious concern for the welfare of our neighbor, streaming from an open heart, flows outward like a vast river, to quench the dry and parched wastelands of hatred, corruption, poverty and violence that so damage human lives, tear families apart, and disfigure the gift of creation,  he said. the pope has called for decisive measures to resolve the political reasons that caused the refugee crisis and urged countries to help the bangladesh government deal with it. earlier this year from the vatican, the pope twice defended the rohingya by name, once saying that they had been  tortured, killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and their muslim faith . the myanmar military launched the crackdown in response to rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts in august and says it is a legitimate counter insurgency operation.

" a man slipped a potentially lethal poison into food, including baby food, on sale in some german supermarkets in an extortion scheme aimed at raising millions of euros, police said on thursday. no cases of poisoning had been reported so far. police said the alleged perpetrator had alerted them by e mail after placing quantities of poison in products for sale in some southern german supermarkets earlier in september, and was now threatening to do so nationwide and elsewhere in europe unless given a pay off of many millions.  we are taking the threat very seriously,  uwe stuermer, deputy chief of police in the southern lakeside city of konstanz, told a news conference.  there is no reason for panic or hysteria,  he added, while warning consumers to be on the look out for packaging that had been tampered with when buying their groceries. police were looking for a suspect who could be seen in security video footage from one of the supermarkets in a town near konstanz and appeared to be a man of around 50. the footage was made public to help in the search. police said they had found some baby food spiked with ethylene glycol, a colorless, odorless liquid used in the manufacture of antifreeze, which can be deadly if consumed. authorities in the southwestern state of baden wuerttemberg said they would intensify checks of food on sale, but warned that identifying contaminated items would be a challenge.  the case is difficult because the blackmailer did not say which food will be targeted or what poison he will use,  a consumer protection official said.

" president emmanuel macron has said his government could consider changes in the relationship between mainland france and corsica, which seeks greater autonomy, but ruled out new residency rights or recognition of corsican as an official language. an alliance of corsica s two main nationalist parties swept a local election on dec. 10 and has been pressing for talks with paris.  its leaders want more autonomy on fiscal issues, an equal status for the french and corsican languages, and the limiting of the right to buy property in some areas to people who have been resident on the holiday island for at least five years.  the two party  pe a corsica  (for corsica) alliance won nearly two thirds of seats in the local assembly election. support for their cause is driven by dissatisfaction with france s mainstream parties, mirroring a trend that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in europe, such as catalonia.  looking ahead, we could consider possible changes, and the prime minister has indicated this to corsica s leaders,  macron said in an interview published by spanish daily el mundo on wednesday.   but these would come, as elsewhere, within the framework of the constitution. this republican framework does not allow us to say yes to certain demands, such as on residency rights or recognizing coriscan as the official language alongside french.  corsica s nationalists are split between those who seek greater autonomy and those who see full independence as the ultimate goal.  corsica makes up two of france s 101  departments    local administration areas. unlike in catalonia, its nationalists downplay any immediate ambitions for independence, saying the island   where napoleon was born in 1769   lacks the spanish region s demographic and economic clout. while macron did not say what he might be prepared to negotiate, it is the first time he has touched on the subject since the vote. france is a highly centralized state and corsica s demands for more autonomy have often been met with irritation and a refusal to negotiate by past governments.

" u.s. cities that refuse to step up efforts to focus on crimes committed by illegal immigrants will not be allowed to participate in a new crime reduction training program unveiled earlier this year by the justice department, attorney general jeff sessions said on thursday. in making the announcement, sessions singled out four local police departments that had expressed interest in the new public safety partnership program, saying they first had to answer a list of questions by aug. 18 confirming they do not have any “sanctuary” policies to shield illegal immigrants from possible deportation by ensuring they will allow federal immigration officials access to local jails. “cities and states with so called ‘sanctuary’ policies make all of us less safe,” sessions said. the four police departments that must respond are albuquerque, new mexico; baltimore, maryland; and san bernardino and stockton, california. “baltimore is a welcoming city. we do not enforce federal immigration laws,” said baltimore police commissioner kevin davis, adding that when cities were initially selected for the program, there was no formal selection process and that baltimore does not control the local jail. jarrod burguan, the police chief of san bernardino, said his department first expressed interest in a similar program during the obama administration, and remains interested in participating. he added san bernardino is not a “sanctuary” city, it does not control the local jail, and he will answer the department’s questions. representatives from the other two police departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. sessions’ announcement reflects part of a broader policy push by president donald trump to crack down on illegal immigration.  he has urged congress to support funding the building of a wall along the u.s. mexico border, and the administration has moved to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation. the national public safety partnership is a program launched in june that involves a three year initiative geared toward areas with high rates of violent crime. twelve cities were selected when it was first launched. some municipalities have pushed back against the trump administration’s immigration policies. a u.s. judge last month refused to remove a block on an executive order by trump that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities, which do not use municipal funds or resources to help advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. new york attorney general eric schneiderman and acting brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez on thursday called on u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) to stop making arrests in courthouses amid concerns it has a chilling effect on local policing and is sweeping up those with low level misdemeanor cases. rachael yong yow, an ice spokeswoman, said the agency’s arrests are carried out “on a case by case basis.” ",0
" a texas law previously struck down requiring voters to show authorized identification before casting ballots will be re examined, the u.s. court for appeals for the fifth circuit said on wednesday.      the court, which said its full bench of judges will participate, did not set a date or elaborate on why it will hold the review of the law a three judge panel from the court said in an august 2015 decision violated the u.s. voting rights act through its “discriminatory effects.” the measure was signed into law in 2011 by then texas governor rick perry, a republican, and has been in effect since  even as the legal challenges have wound their way through the courts. plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have such identification. they contend the measure is used by republicans as a way suppressing voters who typically align with democrats.  the measure, which supporters say will prevent voter fraud, requires voters to present a photo identification such as a driver’s license, passport or military id card. texas attorney general ken paxton, a republican welcomed the court’s decision. “today’s decision is a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the state’s voter id laws. safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process,” he said in a statement. critics contend that voter fraud is a miniscule problem overblown by republicans for political purposes. republicans contend voter fraud erodes the fabric of the democratic process. civil rights groups have urged the court not to re hear the case. u.s. district judge nelva gonzales ramos ruled in october 2014 that the law, which was challenged by the administration of president barack obama and civil rights groups, was unlawful under the voting rights act and u.s. constitution in part because it discriminates against minority voters. the obama administration has been trying to counter a u.s. supreme court ruling in june 2013 that overturned parts of the voting rights act. that ruling freed several states, mostly in the south, from strict federal oversight.

" the u.s. drug enforcement administration’s acting director on tuesday said that he will be leaving his post, two months after he criticized republican president donald trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be “too nice” to suspects. acting director chuck rosenberg, a holdover from democratic president barack obama’s administration, told the agency’s staff in an internal email that he will be leaving his position effective oct. 1. “this is a remarkable agency   full of remarkable people   and i am honored to have been a small part of it,” rosenberg said in the message, which was reviewed by reuters. it was unclear who would replace rosenberg. the news was first reported by the washington post.  a spokesman for the dea confirmed rosenberg’s resignation. rosenberg had been leading the dea in an acting capacity since 2015. before joining the agency, he served as chief of staff to former fbi director james comey, who trump fired in may.  rosenberg generated headlines earlier this year after he wrote an agency wide email in late july challenging comments by trump suggesting officers do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. citing “an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,” rosenberg said trump’s remarks, delivered in new york the previous day, “condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.” he leaves the agency at a time when the dea is grappling with the ongoing opioid drug epidemic, which has become a major law enforcement focus of the u.s. justice department. opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the united states in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. “opioids such as heroin and fentanyl   and diverted prescription pain pills   are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,” rosenberg said in december. “we face a public health crisis of historic proportions.” ",0
" two former top u.s. intelligence officials said on sunday they fear president donald trump is being manipulated by russian president vladimir putin, after trump said he believed putin was sincere in denying russian meddling in the 2016 election. former cia director john brennan and ex national intelligence director james clapper both said trump was mishandling moscow ties even as a special counsel investigates possible collusion between trump’s campaign team and russia.     “i think mr. trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by mr. putin, afraid of what he could do, or what might come out as a result of these investigations... it’s either naiveté, ignorance or fear in terms of what mr. trump is doing vis à vis the russians,” brennan said in an appearance with clapper on cnn’s “state of the union.”     clapper added that foreign leaders who roll out the red carpet for trump are able to manipulate trump. “i do think both the chinese and the russians think they can play him,” clapper said. their comments came after trump told reporters over the  weekend that he had spoken with putin again over allegations of russian meddling in the presidential election and that the russian president again denied any involvement. “i really believe that, when he tells me that, he means it,” trump told reporters. “i think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.” treasury secretary steve mnuchin said on the same show that the criticism leveled against trump’s management of relations with russia and china was “ridiculous.” “president trump is not getting played by anybody,” mnuchin said.     trump also took a swipe at obama era intelligence officials  brennan, clapper and former fbi director james comey, calling  them “political hacks” and questioning the findings of a u.s. intelligence report that concluded that russians sought to tilt  the election in trump’s favor. facing sharp criticism, trump walked back from some of those comments on sunday, saying he has faith in the intelligence leaders he has hired. brennan on sunday called trump’s criticism of him a “badge of honor,” and clapper suggested said trump’s denial of russian interference in the election “poses a peril to the country.” when asked, brennan declined to say whether he knows of any intelligence to suggest that the russians have compromising or damaging information on trump. a dossier penned by a former british spy contains unverified  claims that russia does have embarrassing information on trump.

" swearing in an alternative president of kenya would be an act of treason, the country s attorney general said on thursday, days before an opposition leader expects to be inaugurated by an unofficial people s assembly. such an inauguration would worsen the rifts opened by an acrimonious election season, when more than 70 people died in political violence. the extended campaigns eventually led to  president uhuru kenyatta s re election. attorney general githu muigai did not name anyone, but opposition leader raila odinga said last month that he would be inaugurated by a people s assembly on dec. 12   kenya s independence day. unless a candidate was declared the victor in an election by the independent electoral and boundaries commission and the swearing in was conducted by the kenyan chief justice, muigai told a news conference, such a inauguration is  a process wholly unanticipated by the constitution and is null and void .   the criminal law of the republic of kenya stipulates that sort of process is high treason,  he said.  it is high treason of the persons involved, and any other person facilitating that process.   under kenyan law, treason is punishable by death. muigai said people s assemblies proposed by the national super alliance, odinga s opposition coalition, were illegal as well.  these institutions are unconstitutional they are illegal, they are null and void. the persons involved in their creation are involved in extra constitutional activity and may be visited by the full force of the law,  he said. so far, 12 kenyan counties have passed motions supporting the formation of a people s assembly, most of them counties that had backed the opposition in kenya s protracted voting. odinga and kenyatta faced off in an election in august that kenyatta won. but the supreme court nullified the result, and a repeat election was held on oct. 26. odinga boycotted that vote, saying reforms needed to avoid  illegalities and irregularities  had not been made. kenyatta won again, with 98 percent of the vote. the united states had urged opposition leaders to work within the law and avoid actions like the proposed  inauguration ceremony , a statement from the u.s. embassy in nairobi said on wednesday, following a visit to kenya by donald yamamoto, the acting assistant secretary of state for african affairs.  without directly mentioning the ceremony or the united states, odinga said on thursday that kenyans should be left to solve their own problems.  our friends can give us advice ... in privacy. don t come and shout at us, and tell us that we are going to violate the constitution. which constitution, my foot,  odinga told reporters in nairobi.

" cambodian government lawyers filed a lawsuit on friday to demand the dissolution of the main opposition party, in a move that would help prime minister hun sen extend his 32 year rule when the poor southeast asian nation votes in an election next year. the attempt to disband the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) comes after its leader, kem sokha, was charged with treason following his arrest on sept.3. in their lawsuit on friday, government lawyers said the opposition had conspired with foreigners to topple the government, citing a 2013 video clip that shows kem sokha talking about a plan to take power with the help of americans.  today we filed a lawsuit at the supreme court on behalf of the interior ministry to ask to dissolve the cnrp,  ky tech, one of the government lawyers, told reporters.  the cnrp, besides colluding secretly with foreigners ... also intends to serve foreigners,  the lawsuit said. kem sokha s daughter monovithya kem, who is also an official in the opposition party, said in a post on twitter:  the international community has obligations to act now.  the u.s. embassy said it was unable to comment on the lawsuit filed by the government on friday, but it had earlier  rejected the accusations relating to kem sokha. western countries have condemned the opposition leader s arrest and have questioned whether the election can be fair following the crackdown on opposition leaders, activists and journalists. the european union has made several statements about its concern.  in that context, dissolution by the authorities of the main opposition party would be an extremely negative step,  said eu ambassador george edgar in an email to reuters. hun sen, a former khmer rouge commander who defected from the genocidal group and helped drive it from power in 1979, is allied to china, and beijing says it supports the cambodian government s efforts to maintain national security and stability. half of cambodia s opposition members of parliament have fled the country. one of the remaining parliamentarians derided allegations that the cnrp had been involved in planning a us backed coup.  this is intended to destroy democracy in cambodia,  mao monyvann said of the move to shut down the cnrp.  the ruling cambodian people s party narrowly won the last election in 2013 after losing seats to the opposition in what was hun sen s worst election result since cambodia returned to full democracy in 1998. the ruling party lost ground in local elections in june, after which, according to opposition members, hun sen stepped up a campaign against dissenting voices.  phil robertson, deputy director of human rights watch s asia division, criticized the international community for not responding more strongly to hun sen s crackdown.  the international community obligated itself to protect human rights and democracy in cambodia when they signed the paris peace accords, but now they are looking the other way as that dream dies,  robertson told reuters.  prime minister hun sen is effectively putting an end to cambodian democracy,  he said.

" hundreds of stranded tourists and puerto ricans seeking to leave filled the sweltering halls of san juan international airport on monday anxious for a seat on one of the few flights operating after hurricane maria devastated power and communications across the island. fearful of checking out of hotels in case they could not get on the few flights available, worried visitors waited in long lines at puerto rico s main airport, struggling to reach loved ones and airlines by phone.  everything is hearsay at the moment because there is no communication,  said 31 year old rene kessler, a medical student from baltimore, maryland, preparing to spend the night in the terminal ahead of what he hoped would be a flight home. a microcosm of the storm battered island, san juan airport is a top priority in efforts by puerto rico s cash strapped government to rebuild after maria. experts say the work will take months and likely cost tens of billions of dollars. the screens above american airlines  desks were dark, while jetblue s displays flowed with red rows of cancellations. staff called out the names of passengers who won seats on the few departing planes.  everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out,  said leyla colon, standing in line with her 4 year old daughter at the jetblue terminal. without internet or cell service, she was unable to buy tickets before reaching the airport.  at this point i ll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here,  colon said. carriers said downed infrastructure had caused operations to be scaled back sharply. in some cases, airlines used a nearby hospital to print flight manifests. and some customers were given handwritten boarding passes. mike henderson, a construction firm superintendent, was trying to return to his family in detroit after his wife paid $2,000 dollars for a seat on a delta flight. but airline staff were unable to tell him if he was on the passenger list, he said.  i m drained,  henderson said with a sigh. airlines on sunday were restricted to one or two flights a day, and transportation security administration workers manually inspected bags and patted down passengers.  outside the airport, rows of diesel generators roared in the heat. they have been life savers but have had their side effects too. miguel gonzalez, 42, said he was at the airport to get his asthmatic mother a flight to florida. he was hospitalized for two weeks due to fumes from neighbors  generators that were fired up after hurricane irma hit the island early in september.  maria dealt an even heavier blow to local infrastructure, putting immense pressure on medical services. jessica negron, a resident of orlando, florida, said she had been in the airport since friday waiting for a frontier flight.  they keep changing the story,  she said. nearby, eating canned peaches with a plastic knife, were allyson and marcus singletary from georgia. they said the storm and airport chaos had ruined their anniversary trip.  this is the vacation from hell,  said allyson, 31.  this is  the walking dead  without zombies.

" dominican born adriano espaillat claimed victory on tuesday in the u.s. congressional race to succeed longtime representative charles rangel, signaling change in the historically black neighborhood of harlem that has grown increasingly hispanic. nine democrats ran in the primary to select the party’s candidate for november’s general election. in a district where democratic voters heavily outnumber republicans, tuesday’s winner will have a virtual lock on taking rangel’s vacated seat in the house of representatives. espaillat, once an illegal immigrant, would be the first dominican american member of congress. a state senator, espaillat, held a 3 point lead on state assemblyman keith wright, an african american who was endorsed by rangel and benefited from the political machine of a man who held the job for 46 years. with 98 percent of polling places reporting, espaillat had 36.7 percent of the vote compared with 33.7 percent for wright, a difference of nearly 1,300 votes. “the voters of the 13th congressional district made history tonight,” espaillat, 61, said in a victory speech. “the voters ... elected a country boy from santiago de los caballeros in the dominican republic,” he said, mixing spanish and english. wright, however, refused to concede, telling supporters: “no candidate can declare victory tonight, not until every vote is counted.” the district is dominated by harlem, long a leading cultural center, home to black political and commercial life, and an incubator for jazz.  harlem notably has grown more white with gentrification, but it also has become more hispanic. besides harlem, the district also includes predominantly latino neighborhoods further to the north where espaillat has his base. rangel, 86, a founding member of the congressional black caucus, won his first congressional election in 1970, and since then harlem voters routinely returned him to office every two years, even after his 2010 censure for ethics violations.  espaillat tried and failed to unseat rangel in 2012 and 2014 primary elections. gentrification emerged as a leading issue in the campaign, as a decade long influx of affluent people, many of them white, has transformed harlem’s once blighted blocks of 19th century brownstone town houses. change has muted the distinctive black identity of the area, the home of the apollo theater, the cotton club and other monuments of african american culture. once an upscale dutch neighborhood named after the city near amsterdam, harlem drew african americans during the northward migration of former slaves in the late 19th century and again between the world wars.  in decades past, affluent new yorkers avoided venturing too far north, or “uptown.” but soaring property values have turned harlem into one of new york’s trendiest real estate markets.

" in his first 100 days in office, donald trump made fewer appearances outside of the presidential bubble than his three immediate predecessors, venturing less beyond the white house or his private mar a lago estate, according to a reuters review. the u.s. president cast himself during his election campaign last year as a washington outsider and a populist champion, and often seemed most comfortable at raucous campaign rallies. trump still constantly tells americans what is on his mind through prolific use of twitter messages, but he has not traveled out into the country often since taking office on jan. 20.  trump made comments at official appearances 132 times in the first 100 days, compared with 139 by barack obama in the same period, 177 by george w. bush and 162 by bill clinton. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8m8eu) some 22 of his appearances were in settings other than the white house, air force one, a government agency or at mar a lago, a florida resort that his administration has called the “winter white house.” that compares to 62 such appearances by obama in his first 100 days, 80 for bush and 46 for clinton. reuters reviewed public remarks delivered by the presidents using white house websites, pool reports and documents archived by the american presidency project at the university of california, santa barbara.  trump made public comments on five separate occasions at mar a lago. none of the other three presidents spoke to the public from a personal residence during their first 100 days, although bush spoke twice at camp david, the rustic presidential retreat in maryland.     asked about his travel, trump’s advisers say he is focused on implementing the promises he made at his campaign rallies.     “there is obviously a premium on his time,” said white house spokeswoman natalie strom. “we proceed with any additional travel very thoughtfully.”     bradley blakeman, who was deputy assistant for scheduling and appointments under bush, said trump may be missing out on opportunities to sell his message to the public.  “deals are made in washington on pennsylvania avenue, but they are sold on main street, usa,” blakeman said. “it’s an important part of the bully pulpit.”     he said trump should do targeted events focused on specific legislative priorities that will get coverage by local news outlets, where stories on presidential visits tend to be more positive than in the national media.     during his first 100 days, bush visited more than half a dozen schools in washington and at least five different states as he promoted his education initiative, no child left behind.      trump’s first major legislative push has focused on reforming the u.s. healthcare system, but he has not yet delivered remarks at a medical facility. in an interview with reuters last week, trump lamented the confining nature of the presidency with its 24 hour secret service protection. “you’re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can’t go anywhere,” he said. still, he remains a constant focus of public attention, helped by his use of twitter, a tool that was seldom used or was entirely unavailable to his most recent three predecessors. “interaction online does not completely replace the value of in person appearances, but you can’t ignore the fact that there is no limit on the amount of people the president’s tweets can reach,” strom said. larry jacobs, director of the center for the study of politics and governance at the university of minnesota, said that while trump’s use of social media had opened a new chapter in presidential communication, his lack of sustained attention on any one issue undercut his message.     “there’s not a focus there. when a president is all over the map, then he loses his power,” jacobs said.

" the u.s. drug enforcement administration’s acting director criticized president donald trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be “too nice” to suspects, urging dea agents to show “respect and compassion” and saying he felt compelled to speak out when “something is wrong.” acting director chuck rosenberg sent an agency wide email on saturday, one day after trump’s speech to officers in brentwood, new york, on long island. the email was seen by reuters on tuesday. trump suggested to officers that, as part of a tougher approach to suspects, they do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. that suggestion drew criticism from many local law enforcement agencies, as well as rosenberg. “i write because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,” the acting dea chief said in the email. “the president, in remarks delivered yesterday in new york, condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.” rosenberg, who was not nominated by trump but is a holdover from the obama administration, was the first head of a federal agency to challenge trump’s remarks in a wide arena.  incidents of police brutality and law enforcement killings of black suspects have sparked mass protests nationwide and led many departments to purchase body cameras to record interactions between officers and the public.  trump, a republican, campaigned on a pro law enforcement platform, winning the support of several police unions by promising to be tough on crime and more supportive of police than his predecessor, democratic president barack obama.  chuck canterbury, national president of the fraternal order of police, the nation’s largest police union, said trump’s “off the cuff comments” are taken “too literally” by news media.  “the president knows, just as every cop out there knows, that our society does not, and should not, tolerate the mistreatment or prejudgment of any individual at any point in the criminal justice process,” canterbury said in a statement on saturday.  the dea combats drug trafficking into the united states from offices nationwide and several international posts.  rosenberg said he was not seeking to advance a political agenda, but to remind his agents of their core values, including accountability, diversity and integrity.  “this is how we conduct ourselves. this is how we treat those whom we encounter in our work: victims, witnesses, subjects and defendants. this is who we are,” he wrote.

" the u.s. military said on saturday it has opened an investigation into fake mobile phone alerts and social media messages advising u.s. military personnel and their families to evacuate the korean peninsula.   the phony messages, which were spread on thursday, came at a sensitive time, with tensions high after north korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3.  the test and a series of missile launches have triggered a war of words between u.s. president donald trump and north korea s leader kim jong un.  u.s. forces korea (usfk) was not yet aware of how many people received the hoax messages or who was behind them, a spokesman for the usfk told reuters.  the usfk posted a statement on its official facebook page on thursday making clear that the u.s. military did not issue any evacuation related alerts.  it has also instructed all u.s. department of defense personnel and their family to confirm any evacuation related communications before acting.   the usfk conducts regular biannual noncombatant evacuation operation (neo) exercises in the spring and fall to rehearse for possible evacuation. the second neo exercise of the year is scheduled to take place in october.

" australian senator nick xenophon, a key independent lawmaker,  said on friday he was resigning from national politics, potentially complicating prime minister malcolm turnbull s efforts to pass legislation. turnbull does not have a majority in the senate and has relied on xenophon s party, the fourth largest bloc in the upper house, to pass legislation.  xenophon s replacement will come from his party, which bears his name, but is likely to be a far less experienced compared with xenophon s nine years as a senator.  xenophon was a known quantity, he was experienced and as he saw, turnbull could work with him,  said peter chen, senior lecturer in politics at the university of sydney.   his potential replacement will be inexperienced, and that can be unpredictable. this will not be turnbull s preferred choice.   xenophon s future as a senator was under a cloud due to him holding possible dual citizenship with britain. under the constitution a lawmaker must only hold australian citizenship to be eligible to be elected to the national parliament. xenophon had renounced his greek citizenship, which he received from his mother, but had not been aware he held possible british citizenship. while he was born in australia, his father was born in cyprus, which was a british colony until independence in 1960. xenophon s citizenship issue was due to be determined by australia s high court. australia s high court will next week rule on the eligibility of seven politicians, including xenophon and deputy prime minister barnaby joyce. should joyce be ruled ineligible, turnbull will lose his majority in the lower house. in announcing his surprise resignation, xenophon said he would stand for election in his home state of south australia next year. state parliaments do not have the same citizenship rule as the national parliament.  i have increasingly concluded that you can t fix south australia s problems in canberra without first fixing our political system at home. south australia politics is broken and politically bankrupt,  xenophon told reporters in adelaide.

" president donald trump’s nominee to be the director of national intelligence pledged on tuesday to support thorough investigation of any russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, seeking to reassure lawmakers worried that partisan politics might interfere with a probe. “i think this is something that needs to be investigated and addressed,” former republican senator dan coats told the senate intelligence committee during his confirmation hearing to be the top u.s. intelligence official. coats, 73, a former member of the intelligence panel, also promised that it would have full access to all of the documents and other materials needed for an investigation. “i have no intention of holding anything back from this committee,” coats said. trump denounced intelligence agencies for their assessment that russia sought to influence the election on his behalf, prompting concerns about his support for them. trump has also repeatedly praised russian president vladimir putin, leading some in washington worry that he might not take a hard enough line in dealings with moscow. in his opening statement, coats addressed that concern by listing activity by russia, along with that of china and north korea, as among the main challenges faced by the united states. “russia’s assertiveness in global affairs is something i look upon with great concern, which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism,” coats said. the office of the director of national intelligence was created after the sept. 11 attacks to oversee all 16 u.s. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. one concern about coats was his record on the u.s. use after the 2001 attacks of so called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. in 2015, he was one of the few lawmakers who opposed legislation sponsored by republican senator john mccain that made the use of such techniques illegal. coats promised that he would follow the law, saying he voted against that legislation because he wanted “to at least have a discussion” about the best way to proceed if intelligence agencies wanted to obtain crucial information quickly. coats also strongly defended u.s. government surveillance programs, though he said he would “do everything i can” to publicly disclose an estimate of the number of americans caught in the crosshairs of internet surveillance programs intended to target foreigners.  but he stopped short of guaranteeing such a disclosure, which privacy advocates in congress have requested for years and said is necessary to properly debate possible reforms to a surveillance law that expires at the end of 2017.  although he was ambassador to germany under president george w. bush, coats would be the first director of national intelligence who has not spent most of his career in the military, in intelligence agencies or as a diplomat. coats, who is popular with democrats and his fellow republicans, is expected to be easily confirmed.

" fashion models who want to work in california would need a doctor to attest that they are of healthy weight and not suffering from an eating disorder under a proposal announced by a state lawmaker on monday. the bill proposed by california state assembly member marc levine follows efforts in several countries to fight anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders among models, who are relentlessly pressured to lose weight or lose work. “the evidence of eating disorders in the modeling industry is alarming,” levine, a democrat who represents the marin county suburbs of san francisco, said in a statement on monday. under his bill, which was introduced feb. 19, modeling agencies would have to be licensed by the california labor commissioner, and could be fined if they hire models who do not have a physician certifying that they are healthy. the bill, if passed, directs the state’s department of public health and the occupational safety and health standards board to adopt rules for the health of fashion models that would include periodic health checkups, nutrition consultations and medical testing. levine said the measure, which must pass numerous committees, both houses of the legislature and be signed by democratic governor jerry brown before it could take effect, would also help girls and women, who see impossibly thin models in magazines and aim to be like them. “as a former fashion model and an eating disorder survivor, i know that this legislation is critically needed,” nikki dubose, a former model turned advocate, said in a statement. last spring, france banned excessive thinness in models, partly in response to the death in 2010 of isabelle caro, a 28 year old former french fashion model who died from anorexia after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. israel enacted a similar measure in 2013, while other countries, like italy and spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. as many as 40 percent of fashion models may suffer from eating disorders, levine said. these include anorexia nervosa, which leads sufferers to starve themselves; bulimia nervosa, which involves binge eating followed by purges such as forced vomiting, consumption of laxatives or excessive exercise; and binge eating disorder.

" at least one person was killed and several wounded when guinean security forces opened fire to break up a riot in the bauxite mining hub of boke, witnesses said on wednesday. boke has suffered waves of rioting rooted in a perceived failure of mining to raise living standards, despite 15 million tonnes of aluminum ore being extracted annually by the west african nation s largest mining companies societe miniere de boke (smb) and companie bauxite de guinee (cbg). rioters on wednesday pillaged a gendarmerie post and set fire to a security forces vehicle, before guinean forces opened fire to push them back. they also blocked streets to prevent mine workers from going to work, although smb said its basic operations were still in order.  we feel the tension has increased somewhat,  frederic bouzigues, general manager of smb, told reuters.  many of our employees have not been able to get back to work and this affects us even if our essential operations are not blocked.    guinea sits on about a third of the world s bauxite, but it remains one of the world s poorest countries, and unemployment around mining sites is not significantly lower than in other places. residents of boke protested this week over electricity shortages, another major gripe of residents. the government said calm had now been restored, after two days of demonstrations.  i saw one person dead at the hospital,  witness mamadou diallo told reuters by telephone.  it was a young man of 25 years. i saw about twenty people wounded,  he added. similar riots at the end of april paralyzed boke, and youths trashed several government buildings before being pushed back by security forces firing live rounds, also killing at least one protester.  it was a difficult situation but we took steps to restore calm,  government spokesman damantang albert camara said by telephone. boke residents complain that while seeing none of the wealth from mining, they still suffer associated problems such as pollution from dust blowing off the back of trucks.

" republican officials from 16 u.s. states led by texas said on tuesday they have come to the defense of president donald trump’s ban on travelers from six muslim majority nations, telling the supreme court the order did not unconstitutionally single out muslims and was needed to protect national security. the officials filed a legal brief with the supreme court as it mulls whether to take up the trump administration’s appeal of lower court rulings blocking the travel ban signed by the republican president on march 6 and let it go into effect. in the states’ brief, filed on monday, texas solicitor general scott keller wrote that the executive order does not mention religion at all and distinguishes people based only on nationality. “the executive order therefore is emphatically not a ‘muslim ban,’” keller wrote. keller added that courts should be careful when second guessing a president’s national security determinations, an argument that echoes the administration’s view that the judiciary should defer to the president on such matters. the brief said the order did not violation the constitution’s ban on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion or its guarantee of due process. the filing came after the administration asked the high court last thursday to allow the order to take effect. [nl1n1iz03q] aside from texas, the officials were republican state attorneys general from alabama, arizona, arkansas, florida, kansas, louisiana, montana, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee and west virginia, as well as mississippi’s republican governor. three republican attorneys general came from states with democratic governors: louisiana, montana and west virginia. most of the states had also backed trump earlier in the litigation. many democratic state officials have opposed the ban in lower courts. the high court is due to review legal papers filed by the ban’s challengers, backed by the american civil liberties union, before acting. the briefs are due on monday. a key issue before the justices in whether trump’s comments during the 2016 president campaign, including calling for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states,” can be used as evidence that his order was intended to discriminate against muslims.  the administration filed emergency applications with the justices seeking to block lower court rulings that went against trump’s order barring entry for people from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days while the u.s. government implements stricter visa screening. trump’s order also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. the move comes after the richmond, virginia based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals on may 25 upheld a maryland judge’s ruling blocking the order. [nl1n1ir1fy]  potentially making it harder for his lawyers to win at the supreme court, trump again commented on the case on monday, tweeting complaints that his own administration had issued a “watered down, politically correct version” of an earlier order he signed on jan. 27 that also was blocked by courts.

" representative mike conaway’s new role leading the house intelligence committee investigation into the trump team’s ties to russia has plunged the low profile legislator into one of the most contentious issues in congress and the country. republicans and democrats both praised his selection. he has administrative experience as a committee chairman, and familiarity with delicate subjects after leading the house ethics committee from 2013 to 2015. “i like him. i hope he can get us back on track,” representative eric swalwell, a democratic committee member, said in a brief interview outside the u.s. house of representatives. while conaway, 68, has ties to mainstream republicans and a long association with the bush political family, the former accountant from texas was a strong trump supporter during the 2016 campaign. in 2016, conaway backed trump, citing the candidate’s choice of mike pence as his vice president, his promise to appoint conservative supreme court justices and the congressman’s own vehement opposition to democratic candidate hillary clinton. but unlike devin nunes   who on thursday stepped down as leader of the investigation into alleged russian meddling in the u.s. presidential election, including possible collusion with trump associates   conaway was not a member of the incoming president’s transition team. russia denies the allegations. conaway is considered less partisan than some other republican committee members such as trey gowdy, the chairman of the house select committee that investigated the 2012 attacks on a u.s. diplomatic mission in benghazi, libya. democrats accused gowdy of running a partisan inquiry that focused on former secretary of state clinton in an effort to damage her 2016 presidential campaign. in his statement announcing he would step aside, nunes said gowdy and another republican committee member, tom rooney, would also be leaders of the russia investigation. fox news reported that nunes called conaway on wednesday night. nevertheless, some conaway comments about the russia investigation have raised eyebrows.  during a march 20 committee hearing, he asked fbi director james comey whether washington post reporters had helped intelligence agencies write their assessment that moscow was seeking to help trump win the election. and in a january interview with the dallas morning news, he seemed to make light of the alleged russian meddling in the election, saying it and the democrats’ use of mexican singers to entertain their voters were both “foreign interference.” although he also serves as chairman of the house agriculture committee, conaway has kept a low profile, and is better known for his close ties to the bush family than the media spotlight. first elected to the house in 2004, and easily re elected six times, conaway is the second ranking republican on the intelligence panel. house speaker paul ryan told reporters on thursday that he had faith in conaway. “i am confident that he will oversee a professional investigation into russia’s actions and follow the facts wherever they may lead,” ryan said.

" president donald trump faces an uphill fight convincing the supreme court it should grant his emergency request to reinstate his travel ban on people entering the united states from six predominantly muslim countries. his legal team on thursday night asked the nine justices to allow his controversial march 6 executive order to take effect immediately despite being blocked by lower courts. the supreme court rarely grants emergency requests. at issue is a ban trump has said is necessary to protect americans from terrorist attacks. critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory. trump’s proposed ban was a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. the fight over the emergency application is likely to determine whether the ban ever takes effect. that is because if the court grants the request, the ban’s 90 day term will have expired by the time the court decides the legal fate of the proposal. the 5 4 conservative majority on the high court means trump, a republican who took office on jan. 20, likely has a better chance than he has had to date in more liberal leaning lower courts. “even though it’s a heavy lift getting a stay, it seems to me that the supreme court is the most favorable court they’ve had access to so far,” said john elwood, a washington lawyer. the administration needs five votes on the nine justice court to put the ban into effect. in this instance, the merits  of whether it violates the u.s. constitution’s ban on religious discrimination by targeting muslims matter less. the court weighs several factors when considering emergency applications. one such application met with success when in february 2016 the court granted on a 5 4 vote a request by states and industry groups to block president barack obama’s climate regulations. under supreme court precedent, several criteria need to be met for an emergency application to be granted, including that there would be “irreparable harm” if denied and that there is a “reasonable probability” the court would agree to hear the case on the merits. in the government’s request, acting solicitor general jeff wall wrote that the nationwide injunctions blocking the travel ban have caused irreparable harm by “preventing the executive from effectuating his national security judgment.” the challengers contest the administration claim that urgent action is needed to protect americans from terrorist attacks. they stress that the government did not previously ask the supreme court to intervene, even when lower courts denied earlier emergency applications seeking to lift the injunctions. “this is different from the kind of case you would expect the supreme court to grant the extraordinary relief of a stay, because of the lack of any demonstrable urgency or harm and because the law and the facts are on our side,” said american civil liberties union lawyer omar jadwat. on friday, the court asked the challengers, including the aclu and hawaii, to file responses to the trump requests by june 12. the administration is then likely to file its own response to the challengers’ legal arguments before the justices issue an order granting or denying the administration’s applications. one thorny issue the supreme court may have to resolve if it grants the stay is whether the 90 day ban trump sought to impose would begin from the day of the court’s action or whether the clock has been ticking throughout the litigation, meaning it would expire in mid june. challengers will argue for the latter, which would mean it is almost set to expire. that would limit the practical impact if the application were granted. the court’s conservative majority includes justice anthony kennedy. he sometimes sides with the court’s four liberals and could be the pivotal vote. the travel ban’s challengers have relied in part on a concurring opinion kennedy wrote in a 2015 supreme court immigration case. kennedy wrote that in the immigration context, the government’s actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith. another conservative justice is the man trump appointed to the high court, neil gorsuch. during his u.s. senate confirmation hearing, gorsuch vowed not to be a rubber stamp for any president when asked about trump’s statements criticizing judges who ruled against the travel ban.  if the court agrees with trump, the 90 day ban on people entering the united states from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen will be immediately revived. the court could also put a 120 day ban on all refugees into effect and allow the administration to consider new vetting procedures. even if the court allows the travel ban to take effect, the bigger constitutional questions of religious discrimination and presidential powers raised by the order would not be considered by the nine justices until long after the ban periods have ended. the court begins its summer recess at the end of june and would not give the case a full hearing until its return in the autumn, by which time the ban would have lapsed. the emergency applications filed on thursday night seek to block injunctions issued by judges in maryland and hawaii. the maryland order was upheld on may 25 by the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in richmond, virginia. the government’s appeal of the hawaii injunction is being considered by the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals. that court could issue its decision before the supreme court acts on the emergency application. separate from the emergency application, the court also has to decide whether to hear the government’s full appeal of the virginia based appeals court ruling.  the justices are not required to hear any case, but this one meets important criteria cited by experts, including that it is the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction.

" the latest version of a house republican bill to replace obamacare would limit who could receive tax credits to help purchase health insurance, politico reported on monday, in an effort to secure the support of the chamber’s conservative wing.  congressional republicans and president donald trump have repeatedly promised to repeal and replace former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement but have publicly disagreed about the best way to do so. the house of representatives is expected to unveil its legislation soon.  under a feb. 10 draft of the legislation made available to several news outlets, republicans proposed offering an age based refundable tax credit regardless of income level. that was resisted by conservatives who called it another entitlement program. critics also said extremely wealthy people would receive the credit even though they do not need it.  in the most recent version of the bill, the tax credits would only be available to those within certain income levels, according to politico. they would start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and households earning $150,000, and would be unavailable for individuals who earn more than $215,000, politico reported.  republicans had also initially proposed capping exemptions on employer provided health coverage, a provision that drew the ire of some conservatives who said the bill would remove obamacare’s taxes only to replace it with another.  according to politico, the latest version of the bill would not include a cap. the bill also delays repealing several of obamacare’s taxes until 2018, a year later than initially proposed, politico reported.

" u.s. republican lawmakers voiced deep concern on thursday about reports that the obama administration might allow iran to use the dollar in some business transactions, although no such plans have been announced. u.s. government officials said the issue is being discussed in the treasury department, but any policy change would not involve widespread access for iran to the u.s. financial system, disputing media reports suggesting otherwise. the obama administration is considering easing some sanctions to permit non u.s. companies to have some access to the u.s. financial system for u.s. dollar transactions involving iran, said a u.s. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. the official said the matter was being studied, no decisions had been taken and that, to the official’s knowledge, none were imminent. the underlying reason for weighing the step is that non u.s. companies now able to do business with iran because of last year’s nuclear deal find it is difficult to do so without at some point touching the u.s. financial system. the official said such companies are getting conflicting messages from their own governments, which encourage trade with iran, and from washington, which emphasizes that it will enforce sanctions rigorously. republicans remain dead set against any effort to ease restrictions against tehran, especially in light of iran’s recent missile tests. “as iran continues to undermine the spirit of its nuclear agreement with illicit ballistic missile tests, the obama administration is going out of its way to help tehran reopen for business. the president should abandon this idea,” said paul ryan, the republican speaker of the house of representatives. the controversy could complicate senate confirmation of adam szubin to head treasury’s sanctions enforcement arm, senate aides said. president barack obama nominated szubin in april 2015, but he was not approved in committee until this month. senate leaders tried to bring szubin up for a vote in the full senate a few days later, but at least one senator objected, the aides said. republicans, who control congress, tried to kill the international deal in which iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. some republicans said they opposed szubin because of his support for the agreement, and aides said talk of easing dollar restrictions could fuel their opposition. deal opponents have seized on comments by u.s. treasury secretary jack lew as a sign that the administration would end a ban on iran’s use of the dollar for trade. republican representative ed royce said in a letter to obama that lew appeared in house testimony last week to leave the door open to the administration allowing such transactions. lew said the department was looking at how to “make sure iran gets relief” under the nuclear deal, rather than denying the idea was under consideration. current u.s. policy bars foreign banks from clearing dollar based transactions with iran through u.s. banks. sanctions experts said treasury could issue a license allowing u.s. banks to send dollars to an offshore facility, from which foreign, non iranian banks could withdraw dollars to facilitate legal trade with iran. any allowance would likely bar trade involving blacklisted iranian citizens or organizations. the associated press reported that the obama administration might soon tell foreign governments and banks they could start using the dollar in some instances to facilitate business with iran, citing officials familiar with the discussions. sources in the administration and congress told reuters such a concession was just one of a wide array of options that might be considered. state department spokesman john kirby commented that washington would continue to analyze the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear agreement, known as the jcpoa, while keeping pressure on iran on other areas of concern. “as long as iran continues to meet its nuclear commitments, we will continue to meet our jcpoa commitments for sanctions lifting,” he said.  ",0
" an independent u.n. human rights investigator said on wednesday that he had information about an inmate being tortured at the u.s. guantanamo bay detention facility, despite washington banning  enhanced interrogation techniques  almost 10 years ago. the u.s. department of defense denied the allegation, saying there was no credible evidence to support it. nils melzer, the u.n. special rapporteur on torture, said he had information that ammar al baluchi   accused of being a co conspirator in the 9/11 attacks on the united states   was being subjected to treatment that is banned under international law.   his torture and ill treatment are reported to continue,  a statement from the u.n. human rights office said, without giving details of the source of melzer s information.   in addition to the long term effects of past torture, noise and vibrations are reportedly still being used against him, resulting in constant sleep deprivation and related physical and mental disorders, for which he allegedly does not receive adequate medical attention,  it said. major ben sakrisson, a pentagon spokesman, said the allegation was not true.  these claims have been investigated on multiple occasions in the past and no credible evidence has been found to substantiate his claims,  he said. the prison, which was opened by president george w. bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. his successor barack obama ended the use of  enhanced interrogation techniques  via executive order in january 2009, and reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail. president donald trump asked congress earlier this year for funds to upgrade the jail, having said during his electoral campaign that he wanted to  load it up with some bad dudes . citing a 2014 senate investigation, the u.n. statement said al baluchi was said to have suffered relentless torture for three and a half years in cia  black sites  before being moved to guantanamo, where he had been in a severely restricted access facility at guantanamo bay for more than a decade. al baluchi, a kuwaiti born pakistani citizen also known as abdul aziz ali, is the nephew and alleged co conspirator of khalid sheikh mohammed, the accused mastermind of the sept. 11, 2001, attacks.   melzer said the ban on torture and ill treatment was one of the most fundamental norms of international law and could not be justified in any circumstances, and called for prosecution of u.s. officials who had carried out torture.  by failing to prosecute the crime of torture in cia custody, the u.s. is in clear violation of the convention against torture and is sending a dangerous message of complacency and impunity to officials in the u.s. and around the world,  melzer said in the statement. he said he had renewed a long standing request to visit guantanamo bay to interview inmates, but he and his predecessors in the role had consistently been denied access.  a spokesman for the u.s. state department said that the u.s. constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and requires humane conditions of confinement, including that of solitary confinement.  we support the work of the u.n. special rapporteurs and the united states has a long history of engaging constructively on matters within mandates of the special rapporteurs,  he said.

" cameroon authorities on friday banned all gatherings of more than four people, ordered bus stations, eateries and shops to shut and forbade movement between divisions of its english speaking region for three days to prevent planned protests. anglophone cameroonians plan to demonstrate on oct. 1st, the day of their independence from britain, over what they say is ill treatment and neglect by the predominantly francophone government of president paul biya. the protests have become a lightening rod for opposition to biya s 35 year rule. the last time there were big protests in the western region, the government responded by unplugging the internet, shooting dead six protesters and arrested hundreds of others, some of whom were charged with crimes that carry the death penalty.   public gatherings and assembly of more than four persons shall be strictly forbidden. all off licenses, snack bars and night clubs shall not operate. motor parks shall remain closed,  said the order signed by adolphe lele lafrique, governor of the northwest region.  any persons who attempt to violate this order shall be prosecuted,  it added. the draconian measures are likely to provoke further anger driving a movement that is fast morphing from a bid for equal rights into a full fledged struggle for independence.  cameroon s divide has its roots in the end of world war one, when the league of nations divided the former german colony of kamerun between the allied french and british victors. thousands of anglophone demonstrators took to the streets last friday, some of them hoisting separatist flags. the government ordered its border with nigeria closed this weekend. the anglophone regions have strong ties to eastern nigeria and authorities may fear that allowing the border to remain open during protests offers the demonstrators a rear base and makes it harder to maintain order.

" liberians voted on tuesday in an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago. outgoing president ellen johnson sirleaf, who won the 2011 nobel peace prize, is praised for maintaining peace since taking over after the end of the west african country s 14 year conflict in which child fighters were used. liberia s policy of prioritizing reconciliation over justice, however, has meant that prominent figures responsible for the violence that killed a quarter of a million people are still present on the political landscape.   there is no clear frontrunner but prince johnson, a former rebel leader who finished third in the last election in 2011, is among 20 candidates on the ballot. the ex wife of warlord turned president charles taylor, now imprisoned in the uk for war crimes committed in sierra leone, is the running mate of another favorite: former soccer star george weah.  i am just voting for peace. we want peace right now,  said james marthics, a voter in paynesville, a suburb of the capital monrovia. residents queued before dawn at polling stations in monrovia, some bringing small wooden chairs with them, and formed queues as vendors sold them soft drinks and palm wine.  materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls. state broadcaster elbc reported a party chair in lofa county was detained for distributing money to voters. elections commission head jerome korkoya said some individuals were arrested for trying to vote more than once, but he said voting went smoothly overall. liberia is africa s oldest modern republic. it was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.  johnson sirleaf, africa s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post war transition. she was re elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term. among the favorites to replace her is vice president joseph nyuma boakai.  weah, who has won fifa s world player of the year, was greeted at his polling station by supporters in football shirts. he came second to johnson sirleaf in 2005. ex rebel leader johnson won around 12 percent of the vote in 2011. a widely circulated video showed him sipping a beer as he directed the torture of president samuel doe shortly before his murder in 1990. ballot counting started soon after polls officially closed at 6 p.m. (1800 gmt), though voting continued in some areas where there had been delays. results are expected to begin arriving later this week. but most analysts think it will be difficult for any single candidate to win an outright majority on tuesday, raising the likelihood of a run off election next month. few believe there is a real risk of a return to war but in a national address on monday johnson sirleaf called for peace.  though held in high esteem internationally, many liberians, who call her simply  ellen , say they are disappointed she has not achieved more in her 12 years in office. liberia is currently 177th out of 188 countries ranked by the u.n. human development index, and johnson sirleaf has faced accusations of nepotism and failing to crack down on corruption.

" two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across paris, france officially ended a state of emergency, replacing it with the introduction of a new security law which critics say undermines civil liberties. the new anti terrorism law, effective from wednesday, gives police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred.  some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance, it is the opposite,  french prime minister edouard philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the eiffel tower in paris.  the level of threat is high everywhere in the world,  he said, referring to the attack in new york on tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people. the new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law, although with some modifications. one measure will allow the interior ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area. conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct.  france has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,  human rights watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month. france s human rights watchdog, an independent body, has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of muslims. the french council of the muslim faith, the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of muslim religious activities, said it would remain vigilant about the bill s implementation. however, the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far. a poll conducted in early october showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill. the government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks.  president emmanuel macron said on tuesday islamist militancy remained the biggest security threat to france.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said he will decide on the timing of a snap general election after he returns on friday from a trip this week to address the united nations.  regarding the dissolution of the lower house, i would like to refrain from commenting on every question, but i would like to make a decision when i return home,  abe told reporters on monday as he left for new york, according to a foreign ministry transcript. abe is considering calling a general election, the third since he swept to power in december 2012, as early as oct. 22, to take advantage of a rebound in his approval ratings after a series of scandals for this coalition government, and disarray in the main opposition party, government and ruling party sources told reuters on sunday.     abe is scheduled to speak at the un general assembly and the new york stock exchange on wednesday, and is seeking to arrange meetings with u.s. president donald trump and south korean president moon jae in before returning to japan on friday. an early vote would take advantage of defections in opposition democratic party and could also dilute a potential challenge from an embryonic party that allies of popular tokyo governor yuriko koike, an ex ldp lawmaker, are trying to form.  abe s coalition would be likely to lose its two thirds  super majority  in the lower house but keep a simple majority, political sources say.

" in an historic first, u.s. chief justice john roberts used sign language from the supreme court bench on tuesday as he welcomed a dozen deaf and hard of hearing lawyers who took part in a ceremony authorizing them to argue cases before the court. the 12 members of deaf and hard of hearing bar association were sworn in as members of the supreme court bar. after they were presented to the court for admission, roberts signed in american sign language: “your motion is granted.”membership in the supreme court bar allows a lawyer to argue cases before the justices but most of its members never actually do so.  roberts, appointed by republican president george w. bush in 2005, is believed to be the first u.s. chief justice to use sign language from the bench. it was also the first time members of the deaf and hard of hearing bar association took part in a swearing in ceremony at the court. the lawyers then stayed for oral arguments in two cases in the ornate courtroom, assisted by an interpreter standing in front of the mahogany bench where the eight justices sit. the lawyers were permitted to use an instant transcription service that was transmitted to electronic devices. normally, no electronic devices are allowed in the courtroom. one of the attorneys, teresa curtin of the weitz & luxenberg law firm, said in a statement the event was aimed at encouraging more people with disabilities to embark on legal careers. when she began her law career in the late 1980s, there was only a handful of deaf lawyers in the united states, while now there are around 250, curtin said. in 1982, a deaf lawyer, michael chatoff, argued a case before the supreme court, assisted by a real time transcription system. that case concerned whether a school board was required to provide a deaf student with a sign language interpreter. chatoff lost the case in a 6 3 ruling.

" federal agents have arrested illegal immigrants at california courthouses because local authorities have made such apprehensions at jails difficult, the trump administration’s top two law enforcement officials told the state’s chief justice, who had requested a halt to the practice. in a letter to chief justice tani cantil sakauye made public on friday, u.s. attorney general jeff sessions and department of homeland security secretary john kelly gave no indication that agents would stop the arrests. sessions and kelly criticized california officials for limiting the cooperation of state and local law enforcement officers with u.s. agents, preventing them from going to jails to pick up illegal immigrants arrested for other crimes.   “as a result, ice officers and agents are required to locate and arrest these aliens in public places, rather than in secure jail facilities,” sessions and kelly wrote in the letter dated on wednesday, using the acronym for immigration and customs enforcement. kelly, whose department of homeland security includes ice, and sessions, who as attorney general heads the justice department, are members of republican president donald trump’s cabinet. since taking office in january, trump has widened the net for illegal immigrants to be detained and removed from the country, in keeping with his white house campaign promise. immigrant rights groups say federal agents have entered courthouses with increased frequency this year, including in california, massachusetts, maryland and texas. california law enforcement officers, including in los angeles and san francisco, decline requests from ice agents to hold illegal immigrants past their release dates in local jails so they can be transferred to federal custody. the stance of these law enforcement officials conforms with advice from the state’s two most recent attorneys general. these and other “sanctuary” jurisdictions that opt not to cooperate with federal immigration agents have drawn fire from conservative republicans. on monday, sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars in u.s. funding for cities that fail to assist immigration authorities. in their letter, kelly and sessions said agents make arrests at courthouses rather than other public places in part because visitors are screened for weapons before entering, as they are at jails. they were responding to a letter sent two weeks ago by cantil sakauye, who asked the two cabinet officials to stop immigration agents from arresting undocumented immigrants inside california courthouses. “courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country’s immigration law,” she wrote.  the presence of immigration agents in courthouses in the nation’s most populous state could undermine public trust in its judicial system, she said.  her letter went on to say that immigration agents were “stalking undocumented immigrants” at courthouses, language that drew a sharp rebuke from sessions and kelly.  they said the use of the word “stalking” suggested criminal conduct. they said that was unwarranted because agents have full authority to arrest illegal immigrants.

" country star garth brooks is in discussions to perform at the inauguration of u.s. president elect donald trump, the singer’s representative said on friday, as organizers of the event denied media reports that they were struggling to find a list stars to take part. brooks, 54, one of the world’s best selling solo artists, performed for democrat barack obama’s inauguration in 2009, along with a line up that included bruce springsteen, u2, beyonce, and stevie wonder. “garth has performed for the five living presidents,” his publicist nancy seltzer said on friday. “while rumor has it that he has been asked to perform for president elect trump, he has not been able to commit yet.” no celebrities have yet been announced as taking part in the jan. 20 inauguration. brooks, a country hall of famer with u.s. sales of more than 135 million albums, is currently in hawaii as part of a world tour. he is due to perform in cincinnati, ohio on jan. 21   the day after the inauguration in washington. asked on camera by celebrity website tmz earlier this week if he would sing for trump, brooks replied “it’s always about serving. it’s what you do.” brooks stayed silent during the divisive election in which most stars, including beyonce, katy perry, jay z and jennifer lopez, threw their support behind democrat hillary clinton. hollywood trade publication variety suggested on friday that the inaugural committee would have its work cut out trying to match the celebrity turnout for obama in 2009 given the opposition of much of hollywood to trump. elton john’s spokeswoman last month denied a claim by one member of trump’s team that the british singer would perform. boris epshteyn, communications director for trump’s inaugural committee, on friday denied it was having problems assembling talent. “we have world class talent, world class entertainers reaching out to us offering their help, offering their services so no struggle, whatsoever,” epshteyn told abc television news. the inaugural committee on friday announced that the theme for the jan. 20 celebrations would be “make america great again”   the republican businessman’s campaign slogan. the committee said trump would attend two official inaugural balls on jan. 20, down from the 10 attended by obama. “this is a workman like inaugural. this is not a coronation,” epshteyn said. “and you’ve seen some inaugurals in the past that maybe did seem like a coronation. again, it’s every president’s choice. this president wants to get to work.” (corrects quote in third para to clarify brooks has performed for five presidents, not five inaugurations.)

" vietnam s state run news agency apologized on saturday for issuing what it said was a false report that two more officials of state energy firm petrovietnam were to be prosecuted over financial losses. the original report had also been carried on the government s official website. vietnam news agency said in a statement that it had apologized to phung dinh thuc and do van hau over the false report. it also apologized to their families and to police. the news agency said it had failed to verify its information  carefully enough  before publication. petrovietnam is at the heart of a sweeping high level corruption crackdown in the communist state. former petrovietnam chairman dinh la thang, 56, was arrested on friday. the former member of vietnam s politburo is the most senior executive arrested so far. thang s brother, dinh manh thang, former chairman of a petrovietnam unit, was also arrested on allegations of violating state regulations on economic management. government critics have voiced suspicions that the corruption crackdown is politically motivated, at least in part, and aimed against those close to former prime minister nguyen tan dung, who lost out in an internal power struggle in 2016. the corruption crackdown made global headlines in august when germany accused vietnam of kidnapping former executive trinh xuan thanh in berlin to face trial over a separate case.

" north korea said it will release a south korean fishing vessel on friday for humanitarian reasons after the boat was found  illegally  in waters under the north s control six days ago, north korean state news agency kcna said. the boat and its crew had been captured on oct. 21 and they will be released  at the designated waters of the military boundary line in the east sea (38 39 20  latitude, 128 38 10 longitude) at 1800 on oct. 27,  the news agency report said.  north korea had reached its decision to release the south korean boat after  taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offence, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency,  the report said in english. an investigation by the north had  proved  the boat and crew had entered north korean waters for fishing. north korean fishing boats, because of age or low fuel, have been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two koreas at times. most north korean crew are released to the north after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return. it is more unusual for south korean fishing vessels to be found under similar circumstances. the south korean government could not be immediately reached for comment.

" u.s. republican presidential hopeful donald trump called for higher tariffs on chinese goods if china does not stop allowing its yuan currency to devalue. trump reiterated a call he has made for a 45 percent tariff to offset devaluation. the billionaire businessman also criticized japan, saying it was engaging in similar practices and pointed to competition between tractors made by u.s. company caterpillar inc (cat.n) and those made by japan’s komatsu ltd (6301.t). “they’re devaluing their currency, and they’re killing our companies,” trump said. “we are letting them get away with it, and we can’t let them get away with it.” the yuan posted modest gains on friday, but it was still around 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar than it started the year and has lost nearly 5 percent since august. the question of how best to respond to china’s currency devaluation become a topic of discussion between the republican presidential hopefuls in thursday night’s debate.  former florida governor jeb bush criticized trump for calling for higher tariffs, saying that would only prompt retaliation against u.s. goods. “this would be devastating for our economy,” bush said in response. “we need someone with a steady hand being president of the united states.”  u.s. senator marco rubio of florida said he opposes tariffs on chinese goods because it would only increase prices for american consumers.  “china doesn’t pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. if you send a tie or a shirt made in china into the united states, and an american goes to buy it at the store and there’s a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to the consumer,” rubio said. trump responded that rubio’s approach   to simply build the american economy in response   would take too long.  “you absolutely have to get involved with china. they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs, in terms of money,” trump said. “we just can’t do it any longer.” u.s. senator ted cruz of texas agreed that a tariff would not solve the trade problem with china.  “if we just impose a tariff, they’ll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt iowa farmers and south carolina producers and 20 percent of the american jobs that depend on exports,” cruz said, referring to two of the early voting states in the presidential nominating contest. asked about trump’s remarks, chinese foreign ministry spokesman hong lei told a regular press briefing that china adjusted its currency based on market needs and that it would maintain the yuan exchange rate at a “reasonable equilibrium level”.  “we are opposed to competitive devaluation of the currency, as well as currency wars,” hong said.

" the top executive at the company behind the embattled dakota access pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to republican presidential candidate donald trump since june, according to campaign finance disclosure records. the donations by kelcy warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator energy transfer partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the u.s. oil and gas industry than his opponent, democrat hillary clinton. warren donated $300 to the trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election.  he also gave $100,000 to the trump victory fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the trump campaign, the republican national committee, the republican party of arkansas and the connecticut republican party.  the donations, first reported by the british newspaper the guardian, were made before the u.s. government halted construction on a segment of energy transfer partners’ 1,100 mile (1,770 km) dakota access pipeline in early september following protests by native american and environmental groups.  the project, which would move oil from the highly productive bakken shale formation to the midwest and gulf coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and native american tribe members and other protesters. opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the standing rock sioux tribe and pollute the area’s drinking water.  warren has also given $66,800 to the republication national committee since trump secured the nomination for the nov. 8 election, the guardian reported. trump has not yet taken a position on the dakota access pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. asked about trump’s position on the dakota access pipeline in a policy debate this week, u.s. representative kevin cramer of north dakota, one of the candidate’s main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of trump. he added, “i’m not sure he (trump) is aware of it.”  if elected, trump in his first 100 days will ask transcanada to renew its permit application for the keystone xl pipeline, according to his campaign website. u.s. president barack obama rejected the proposed pipeline from canada last november. trump has holdings in energy transfer partners and phillips 66, a joint owner of the dakota access pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records. u.s. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the democratic candidate and $99,302 to trump since july, according to a reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

" french truck drivers blocked traffic at border crossings with spain, italy and belgium on tuesday in protest over cut price competition in the road freight industry. french truckers are angry that an agreement reached by eu member states on oct. 23 to limit the amount of time workers can be  posted  from one eu country to another does not cover the road transport sector. [l8n1my3rf] as a result, french truckers face being priced out by drivers from other eu member states, especially east europe, spain and portugal, who are willing to do fixed term work for lower pay than french drivers might normally receive.  widening gaps in pay and conditions endanger french firms and workers,  said pascal favre, a member of the force ouvriere labor union who was among truckers protesting in southwest france, near the border with spain.  (there are) those who work for lower pay because they spend more time behind the wheel on jobs the french do not do because of unfair competition.  the  posted workers  issue effectively pits wealthier eu countries against poorer peers like poland and bulgaria, whose skilled workers are keen to move around the eu on fixed term contracts, earning more than they would do at home but often undercutting workers in the host country. the number of workers posted to france from other eu countries rose 23.8 percent to 354,151 in 2016, after a similar jump the preceding year, according to a government count cited by the business newspaper les echos on tuesday. emmanuel macron made the issue part of his presidential campaign, saying he would fight to protect workers from unfair competition. while he managed to forge agreement among the eu s 28 states for some adjustments to the rules, transportation workers were not included. about 200 french truckers took part in the protest at the northern border crossing into rekkem in belgium, waving cars through but halting trucks, a local police official said. traffic on the main motorway from the french city of lille to the belgian city of ghent was disrupted by another trucker protest in the region for a few hours early in the day. traffic through the frejus tunnel to italy in the southeast was similarly disrupted, as were some crossings with spain. it wasn t immediately clear how great the economic impact of the protests would be, although they were not expected to continue beyond tuesday.

" the leader of the small constitutional democratic party of japan, which out performed expectations in an october vote, now hopes that by offering clear policy alternatives he can oust prime minister shinzo abe s coalition in the next election. one key to achieving that ambitious goal, said party founder yukio edano, is an economic platform that puts more weight on redistributing wealth, including by raising corporate taxes to push firms to use their cash reserves to raise wages.   unless we have reasonable redistribution to achieve growth, domestic demand will not expand,  edano, 53, told reuters in an interview.   that is a clear difference from the ldp,  he said, referring to the ruling liberal democratic party. the cdpj was formed less than three weeks before the oct. 22 election, after the then main opposition democratic party s leader decided not to field candidates and encouraged them to run on tokyo governor yuriko koike s novice conservative party s slate. it grabbed the top opposition spot in the lower house poll, although its 54 seats are dwarfed by the 283 won by abe s conservative ldp.  since we are the biggest opposition party, we must aim at a change in government in the next election, or else democracy is not functioning,  said edano, who said he was surprised by his party s success.   that is our responsibility.  the next general election must be held by october 2021. the cdpj opposes abe s proposal to revise article 9 of japan s post war constitution, which bans a standing military but has been interpreted to allow armed forces exclusively for self defence, and unlike the more authoritarian ldp, stresses civil rights rather than obligations to the state. the party appears to have a long way to go, given support at 7.9 percent against 38.1 percent for the ldp in a survey by nhk public broadcaster this week.  edano s fighting words, however, mark a contrast from the failed democratic party s stance in recent polls, when it aimed only to keep abe s coalition from winning a two thirds  super majority  rather than ousting it. edano said he would not repeat the mistakes of the democrats, which from the start was an amalgam of conservatives, liberals and ex socialists and ended up being plagued by infighting during its 2009 2012 term in office.  our positions were clear,  he said, explaining why he thought the cdpj outperformed opposition rivals.  we must not make our ideas and policies vague just to broaden (the party).  edano said abe s biggest defect was his apparent belief that a majority entitled him to do whatever he wanted. abe, whose support was at 49 percent in the nhk poll, saw his ratings sink this year partly due to perceptions he had grown arrogant.  democracy doesn t mean you get a blank cheque,  edano said.

" after 21 weeks at the controls of the white house and both chambers of the u.s. congress, president donald trump and his republicans have yet to pass major legislation into law and are short on time to do so before washington’s long summer recess. the house of representatives reconvened on tuesday. it will be in session for the next nine weekdays, along with the senate, which reconvened on monday. both chambers will take a break from july 1 9, then return and work july 10 28. after that, capitol hill will be quiet through the annual august vacation. trump set high expectations as a candidate and early in his presidency, promising to repeal and replace obamacare, invest in infrastructure and work to cut taxes and regulations. these pledges have helped fuel a powerful stock market rally. trump’s only big domestic policy win, aside from killing a handful of obama era regulations, has been senate approval 10 weeks ago of a new supreme court justice. the white house has not sent congress a legislative proposal on any major issue. trump has been swamped by investigations into possible ties between his campaign and alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election. in congress, the house has approved an obamacare rollback bill, but it has stalled in the senate. on tuesday, vice president mike pence predicted a republican healthcare bill would be enacted by the end of summer. competing tax reform plans have divided republicans in both chambers. no firm infrastructure plan has emerged, and lawmakers have not yet formulated a budget plan for 2018. urgent budget deadlines will follow the august break, and later in the year, lawmakers will begin focusing on the 2018 congressional elections. here is a look at key dates coming up. june 20: special house elections in georgia and south carolina. june 30: congress starts independence day break. july 7 8: trump attends g20 summit in germany, his first face to face meeting with russian president vladimir putin. july 28: congress adjourns for five week summer recess. july august: u.s. treasury may no longer be able to postpone the federal debt limit, although this may not arrive until late 2017. sept. 5: congress reconvenes. sept. 30: end of federal fiscal year 2017. without congressional action, funding for many programs will expire. oct. 1: start of federal fiscal year 2018. current federal spending deal expires. without a new deal, the federal government could shut down.

" the united states wants a meeting soon aimed at reviving a four way dialogue between itself, japan, india and australia to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing to that offered by china, a senior u.s. official said on friday. the so called  quad  to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago   much to the annoyance of china, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances. in an interview with japan s nikkei newspaper on wednesday, japanese foreign minister taro kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and australian foreign minister julie bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in manila in august. according to the nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from asia to africa. it said japanese prime minister shinzo abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to u.s. president donald trump on nov. 6, when the u.s. leader visits japan as part of an asian tour that will also take him to china. alice wells, washington s acting assistant secretary of state for south asia, told reporters after accompanying tillerson on a visit to india that washington was  looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.   the quadrilateral the japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with india and japan,  she said. wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values  to reinforce those values in the global architecture.   as we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values   freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously australia would be a natural partner in that effort.  wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing china, which has alarmed asia pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the south china sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.  she said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development,  that don t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.   it s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain china,  she said.  it s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the indo pacific region.  tillerson said before visiting india that washington saw room to invite others, including australia, to join u.s. india japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to chinese financing that was saddling countries with  enormous  debts and failing to create jobs.

" president donald trump is unlikely to win congressional support for funds he wants for a proposed u.s. mexico border wall before an oct. 1 deadline, meaning he may have to choose between backing down on a key campaign promise or shutting down the government. the second option was a politically dangerous one before  hurricane harvey tore through southern texas over the weekend and it now looks even riskier. at a campaign style rally in phoenix last week, trump  doubled down on his earlier demands that congress fund a mexican border wall in government spending legislation, adding a clear threat. “if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” he told supporters. since then, lawmakers who were already struggling to hammer out a stop gap federal spending bill before oct. 1 to avoid a shutdown have had to factor in trump’s threat as well. during his election campaign, trump insisted mexico would pay for the construction of the wall, which experts said could cost about $22 billion and take more than three years to complete. with mexico refusing to pay, trump has said since taking office in january that the wall will initially need u.s. funding but that he will find a way to make mexico ultimately pay for it. a government shutdown would result if congress is unable to agree on a spending deal or if trump does not like the package and vetoes it. a veto would put trump in a dangerous position of rejecting a bill approved by his own party. “shutting down the government would be a self destructive act, not to mention an act of political malpractice,” republican representative charlie dent said in an interview. republicans firmly control the house of representatives, but have only a narrow majority in the senate, where at least eight democratic votes will be needed to pass a spending bill. democratic leaders firmly oppose the border wall and appear to be in no mood to do trump a favor by including funding now. “democrats aren’t feeling the heat over this,” democratic strategist jim manley said, adding that “no democrat is going to be cowed” by trump’s threat to shut down the government. without democratic support, current and former congressional aides from both parties said they expected senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, who has been sharply criticized by trump in recent weeks, to opt for a spending bill without wall funding to get legislation to the president’s desk. dent said he expected the senate would “strip out” $1.6 billion that had been set aside to start building the wall in a spending measure already passed by the house, and send it back to that chamber for another vote.  dent voted for the wall funding the first time but said he would approve the spending measure without the wall money if that is what it takes to keep the government open. asked what congress would do if trump vetoes a spending  bill, dent said: “we’ll have to determine what our next steps will be, but i’m hopeful he’ll sign the bill.” short term fix a stop gap spending bill would keep the government open for several months with no major changes to spending programs while lawmakers work out a longer term deal. the u.s. congress has relied heavily on those short term fixes   known as continuing resolutions   for many years. federal assistance for those affected by devastating floods triggered by harvey could be attached to a new continuing resolution.  but trump said on monday the hurricane recovery effort had not caused him to reconsider the option of a government shutdown. “i think it has nothing to do with it, really. i think this is separate,” he said at a news conference. he said he hoped a government shutdown would not be needed but declined to rule it out. “if it’s necessary, we’ll have to see.” if trump signs a short term extension without wall funding, it could delay the battle until december, when that legislation would likely expire. trump also said on monday that the border wall was “imperative” in order to tackle drug trafficking and crime as well as illegal immigration. the budget debate is also complicated by the need to finance support for victims of harvey, the worst storm to hit texas in more than 50 years, and find a deal on increasing the federal debt ceiling, which limits how much money the u.s. government can borrow. one possible escape route for trump could be separate legislation for funding the wall. john cornyn, the no. 2 republican in the senate, has introduced legislation that would authorize $15 billion over four years for border security. that would still need the support of at least eight senate democrats.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump stepped up his bid to win over minority voters by addressing a largely black church in detroit on saturday and calling for a new civil rights agenda to support african americans. as scores of protesters outside chanted “no justice, no peace,” trump said he wanted to make detroit   a predominantly african american city which recently emerged from bankruptcy   the economic envy of the world by bringing back companies from abroad. trump separately met with about 100 community and church leaders, his campaign said, in his latest push to peel away minority voters from democratic candidate hillary clinton. his outreach to minorities over recent weeks comes as he seeks to improve his chances in the nov. 8 election and shake off months of offending the sensibilities of black and hispanic voters with his hard line on immigration and rough hewn rhetoric.   “i fully understand that the african american community is suffering from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right,” trump said at the church which was half full. “i want to make america prosperous for everyone. i want to make this city the economic envy of the world, and we can do that.” his address of over 10 minutes at the great faith ministries international church received moments of applause, including when he said christian faith is not the past, but the present and the future. accompanying trump to the church was ben carson, the former republican presidential hopeful who grew up in the city and whose childhood neighborhood trump visited on saturday. trump has argued that his emphasis on job creation would help minority communities in a way that democrats have failed to. but clinton has accused trump of aligning himself with racists.  opinion polls show trump has low support among minorities. “i believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that ensures the rights to a great education, so important, and the right to live in a good paying job and one that you love to go to every morning,” trump said. “that can happen. we need to bring our companies back,” he added. emma lockridge, 63, said as she entered the church that she found his comments about mexicans and muslims “hateful.” “that’s my major reservation with mr. trump is how he’s treated those particular sets of people,” said lockridge, who is retired and an environmental activist.  but she said she also had concerns about clinton’s support in the 1990s for crime legislation signed by her husband, former president bill clinton, which many black americans say contributed to high incarceration rates in their communities. vicki dobbins, an activist protesting outside, said she was disappointed the church asked trump to speak. “i believe that trump coming to detroit is a joke, and i’m ashamed of the pastor who invited him,” she said. “in my opinion, he stabbed everyone in the back.” ",0
" the u.s. congress was ironing out a new plan on wednesday to rescue puerto rico from crippling debts that threaten the island territory’s funding for hospitals and emergency services, as the treatment of bondholders simmers as a point of contention. the obama administration and congressional democrats raised concerns about legislation being floated by republicans. it would steer creditors and holders of puerto rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. puerto rico’s economy has struggled for years and the u.s. territory’s government has borrowed heavily to pay its bills. its bankruptcy reorganization options are limited under present law and congress has become involved. the republican bill “imposes an unworkable, mandatory process” on debt restructurings “that will only delay the ability to reach a comprehensive resolution,” treasury department counselor antonio weiss told a congressional panel. all of puerto rico’s many debtors “would have to complete a complicated process before any single entity could begin to restructure,” weiss said in prepared testimony to the u.s. house of representatives natural resources committee, which hopes to advance legislation soon. republicans control the u.s. congress, but they likely will need support from democrats to pass a rescue plan. weiss painted a dire picture of puerto rico, where he said essential government services are being curtailed because of a lack of cash, hospitals have closed some floors amid layoffs, and fuel for emergency vehicles is running dry. house democratic leader nancy pelosi, speaking to reporters,  complained of television ads airing in some parts of the united states that she said were misleading. the actions being weighed, pelosi said, “do not cost the taxpayers one dollar.” pelosi said democrats are concerned “about the negative impact of the legislation on working people in puerto rico, as well as the effects of transferring federal lands on vieques without providing for strong conservation protections.”  if the house committee can amend the bill in a way that a majority of members approve, it would advance to the full house. many investors would face a loss under the republican plan and are lobbying congress to protect their bottom lines. the rescue plan adopts some principles of bankruptcy law, and some lawmakers have balked at the idea of letting puerto rico modify its bonds, saying it would create chaos for municipal markets.

" wikileaks founder julian assange said on tuesday the group’s publication of material linked to hillary clinton was not based on any desire to influence the u.s. election. “in recent months, wikileaks and i personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the clinton campaign says about itself to itself,” assange said in a statement released by his legal adviser at the web summit, a tech conference in lisbon. “this is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election.” wikileaks has in the past few months published thousands of emails hacked from john podesta, democrat candidate clinton’s campaign manager.  assange said wikileaks had obtained no inside information about republican candidate donald trump. “we cannot publish what we do not have,” he said. “we are seen as domain experts on clinton archives. so it is natural that clinton sources come to us,” assange said. “no one disputes the public importance of these publications,” he added. “it would be unconscionable for wikileaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.” assange said wikileaks would continue to publish sensitive information regardless of who wins the u.s. election. “the democratic and republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers,” he said. assange has been living in ecuador’s london embassy since mid 2012. a few weeks ago ecuador’s government acknowledged it had restricted his internet access, arousing speculation it had been pressured by the united states because of the clinton material.

" u.s. president donald trump has opted not to set up a “war room” in the white house to serve as a rapid response team to answer accusations involving an investigation into his campaign’s ties to russia, a white house official said on tuesday. any such rapid response team, the official said, is instead likely to be a function of trump’s outside counsel, marc kasowitz. white house officials had been discussing the possibility of hiring former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski to spearhead an internal “war room” to battle the various controversies emanating from a justice department probe into contacts between trump aides and russia. “if it exists, it won’t be here,” the white house official told reuters. “it would most likely be outside the white house.” but it is possible, the official added, that the white house could beef up its rapid response operation as it does some retooling of trump’s communications effort. the official said it made more sense from a legal standpoint to have any russia war room operation outside of the white house. trump fired james comey, former director of the federal bureau of investigation, on may 9 amid accusations that the president was trying to squelch a federal probe into the russia claims. comey is to testify before the u.s. congress on thursday to lay out the details of his conversations with the president about russia before the firing. trump has called the probe a “witch hunt” and said there was no collusion between his campaign and russia.

" saudi arabia s shura council, an influential advisory body to the government, will vote on a proposal to merge the religious police into the ministry of islamic affairs, local media reported, further curbing the force s authority. the religious police, officially known as the commission for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, patrols public spaces to enforce bans on alcohol, music, prayer time, store closures and the mixing of unrelated men and women. it also imposes strict modesty requirements on women s dress. last year, amid a reform drive to diversify the saudi economy and open up its society, the government increased curbs on the religious police, barring it from pursuing suspects or making arrests. saudi gazette reported late on sunday that the proposal to end the commission s autonomous status, put forward by atta al thibaiti and two other members, is expected to see a vote next week. king salman s approval would be needed to implement such a measure.  the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice is an islamic duty for every muslim, and the sharia tenets had never considered practicing [that] to be under an independent organ or an autonomous entity,  the report said, citing the proposal s supporters. the shura members were quoted as saying the merger would also help ease the state s budget deficit by  avoiding duplication of efforts and cutting expenditure . hardline conservatives say the religious police are central to imposing the kingdom s austere form of sunni islam, while aggressive enforcement of strict morality rules has drawn criticism from more liberal saudis. the vice squad has come under fire online and in local media over several high profile cases of car chases resulting in fatal accidents, prompting the commission s president to ban such pursuits in 2012. the commission stirred controversy again last year after video posted on social media showed members beating a young woman outside a riyadh mall. the patrol had tried to force the woman to cover her face, local media reported. saudi gazette quoted thibaiti as saying the proposal to merge the two bodies had overcome initial opposition by the shura s committee on islamic and judicial affairs. members could not immediately be reached for comment.

" several environmental groups filed lawsuits against the trump administration on thursday to challenge its decision to approve construction of transcanada corp’s controversial keystone xl crude oil pipeline. in two separate filings to a federal court in montana, environmental groups argued that the u.s. state department, which granted the permit needed for the pipeline to cross the canadian border, relied on an “outdated and incomplete environmental impact statement” when making its decision earlier this month. by approving the pipeline without public input and an up to date environmental assessment, the administration violated the national environmental policy act, groups including the center for biological diversity, sierra club and the northern plains resource council said in their legal filing. “they have relied on an arbitrary, stale, and incomplete environmental review completed over three years ago, for a process that ended with the state department’s denial of a cross border permit,” the court filing says. in the other filing, the indigenous environmental network and north coast rivers alliance sought injunctive relief, restraining transcanada from taking any action that would harm the “physical environment in connection with the project pending a full hearing on the merits.” u.s. president donald trump announced the presidential permit for the keystone xl at the white house last week. transcanada’s chief executive officer russ girling and sean mcgarvey, president of north america’s building trades unions, stood nearby. trump, a republican, said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce u.s. dependence on foreign oil.  his democratic predecessor, former president barack obama, rejected the pipeline, saying it would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and do nothing to reduce fuel prices for u.s. motorists. “this tar sands pipeline poses a direct threat to our climate, our clean water, wildlife, and thousands of landowners and communities along the route of this dirty and dangerous project, and it must and will be stopped,” said michael brune, executive director of the sierra club, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit. the lawsuits came on the heels of a lawsuit filed on wednesday challenging other recent moves to undo obama’s climate change regulations. conservation groups and the northern cheyenne native american tribe of montana sued the administration on wednesday for violating the national environmental policy act when it lifted a moratorium on coal leases on federal land.  all lawsuits have been filed in u.s. district court in montana’s great falls division.

" growing numbers of u.s. states are seeking to ensure that women have continued access to free birth control in case the insurance benefit is dropped as part of president elect donald trump’s vow to repeal and replace the affordable care act. the 2010 law, popularly called obamacare, requires most health insurance plans to provide coverage for birth control without a patient co payment, which can be as much as $50 per month for birth control pills or $1,000 for long acting contraceptives such as intrauterine devices. california, maryland, vermont and illinois since 2014 have enacted statutes codifying the affordable care act’s contraception mandate in state law and expanding on the federal law’s requirements. democratic lawmakers in new york, minnesota, colorado and massachusetts said they are pursuing similar measures this year, with obamacare under mortal threat in washington. new york’s democratic attorney general, eric schneiderman, on wednesday introduced such a measure in his state’s legislature that would expand on the obamacare contraception mandate. “women across new york are very concerned that republican efforts to repeal the aca will mean the loss of the contraception on which they rely,” schneiderman said. “i won’t hesitate to act to protect new yorkers’ rights   including the right to choose, and the right to birth control   no matter what a trump administration does,” schneiderman added, referring to abortion rights. trump, who succeeds democratic president barack obama on jan. 20, and his fellow republicans in congress have made dismantling obamacare their “first order of business,” as vice president elect mike pence put it on jan. 4. [nl1n1eu0rw] republicans in congress have not presented a detailed proposal for repealing and replacing the law but many republicans and religious conservatives have opposed the obamacare contraception mandate. [nl1n1eu0rw] twenty eight of the 50 states currently have laws requiring private insurers to provide coverage for birth control. but not all the laws affect all insurance plans, and only a few mandate cost free birth control. out of pocket expenses the obamacare contraception mandate has applied since 2012 to most new insurance plans including employer provided coverage. in 2013, for example, the mandate saved u.s. women more than $1.4 billion in out of pocket expenses for birth control pills, according to a report by university of pennsylvania researchers. almost 6.9 million privately insured u.s. women used the pill that year. the legislative move by some states, most of them democratic governed, is designed to clear up uncertainty for some of the 55 million women who now have access to free contraceptives and related treatments under the affordable care act. conservatives also have chipped away at the obamacare mandate in court. the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2014 that forcing family owned businesses to pay for employee insurance coverage for birth control ran afoul of another federal law safeguarding religious freedom. the supreme court last may sent another legal challenge by nonprofit christian employers back to lower courts to reconsider the matter after tossing out their rulings favoring the obama administration. [nl2n18d0pl] “i think it is even more important now,” said colorado state representative susan lontine, who last year co sponsored a contraception coverage bill in her state’s legislature that did not get passed but she expects to be resurrected in 2017. “we don’t know what will happen on the federal level.” california in 2014 became the first state to pass a contraception mandate that went further than the obamacare language. maryland, vermont and illinois last year passed laws that also eliminated co pays for vasectomies and allowed women to fill a birth control prescription for at least six months rather than one to three.  the new york legislation would allow women to fill multiple months of a birth control prescription, prohibit private insurers from “medical management” reviews that could limit or delay contraception coverage, and provide coverage for vasectomies without a co pay. within a matter of months, the trump administration even without congressional action could drop contraception from obamacare’s list of preventive services that health insurance plans must cover without out of pocket costs, said laurie sobel, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit kaiser family foundation. if repealed, some employers might choose to maintain the coverage without a co pay because it is a relatively inexpensive benefit popular with employees. the proportion of privately insured women who paid nothing out of pocket for birth control pills increased from 15 percent in the fall of 2012 to 67 percent in the spring of 2014 during the time when the coverage went into wide effect, according to the guttmacher institute research organization. the no cost contraceptives coverage also spurred women to switch to long acting methods such as the iud, which is offered in the united states by bayer, teva, allergan and medicines360, studies have found. more than 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men support the no cost contraceptives coverage, according to a 2015 washington post/kaiser family foundation survey.

" mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to president enrique pena nieto s pledge to get gang violence under control with presidential elections due in 2018. a total of 23,101 murder investigations were opened in the first 11 months of this year, surpassing the 22,409 registered in the whole of 2011, figures published on friday night by the interior ministry showed. the figures go back to 1997. pena nieto took office in december 2012 pledging to tame the violence that escalated under his predecessor felipe calderon. he managed to reduce the murder tally during the first two years of his term, but since then it has risen steadily. at 18.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, the 2017 mexican murder rate is still lower than it was in 2011, when it reached almost 19.4 per 100,000, the data showed. the rate has also held below levels reported in several other latin american countries. according to u.n. figures used in the world bank s online database, brazil and colombia both had a murder rate of 27 per 100,000, venezuela 57, honduras 64 and el salvador 109 in 2015, the last year for which data are available. the u.s. rate was 5 per 100,000. still, pena nieto s failure to contain the killings has damaged his credibility and hurt his centrist institutional revolutionary party (pri), which faces an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the july 2018 presidential election. the law bars pena nieto from running again. the current front runner in the race, leftist andres manuel lopez obrador, has floated exploring an amnesty with criminal gangs to reduce the violence, without fleshing out the idea. mexican newspaper reforma said on saturday that after a campaign stop in the central state of hidalgo on friday, lopez obrador again addressed the issue when asked whether talks aimed at stopping the violence could include criminal gangs.  there can be dialogue with everyone. there needs to be dialogue and there needs to be a push to end the war and guarantee peace. things can t go on as before,  reforma quoted lopez obrador as saying. such a strategy harbors risks for the former mexico city mayor. a poll this month showed that two thirds of mexicans reject offering an amnesty to members of criminal gangs in a bid to curb violence, with less than a quarter in favor. separately, lopez obrador said on saturday he would get rid of mexico s intelligence agency cisen if he won the july election, calling it an  unnecessary expense.   we re not going to monitor anybody, we re not going to spy, we re not going to listen to phone calls, or hack phones to get files and photos,  he said in the central town of tezontepec.

" top u.s. labor leader richard trumka on tuesday blasted the trump administration’s initial plan to revamp the north american free trade agreement (nafta), calling it “very timid.” speaking before an audience at the national press club, trumka said that the administration could leave the “most oppressive pieces” of nafta in place despite president donald trump’s harsh criticism of the 23 year old trade deal with mexico and canada. trump called nafta a “disaster” throughout the 2016 election campaign, but the plan outlined in a draft notification letter would preserve many of its provisions, including a settlement system for other disputes that circumvents local courts. the u.s. trade representative’s office circulated the letter with its nafta objectives to members of congress for review. the letter, seen by reuters, is part of the legal process required to start negotiations to revamp the nafta. the afl cio, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, endorsed trump’s opponent in the presidential election, hillary clinton. but the afl cio has long been critical of nafta and trumka, the labor federation’s president, met with trump after the election.   trumka said on tuesday that the afl cio will judge the trump administration based on its actions and provide backing when it supports workers. how trump handles the revamping of nafta “will be the real test,” trumka said. trumka said there are dozens of changes to the trade pact that unions favor, such as making its labor standards fully enforceable and scrapping the entire dispute resolution system for antidumping and antisubsidy cases.

" the u.s. department of homeland security terminated a program on wednesday that allowed minors fleeing violence in el salvador, guatemala and honduras to settle in the united states, ending travel hopes for more than 2,700 children awaiting approval. in a notice published in the federal register that goes into effect aug. 16, the government said it was ending the practice of granting parole under the central american minors (cam) program, which was offered to children even if they had been denied refugee status. the program started at the end of 2014 under the administration of former president barack obama as a response to tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors and families from central america who arrived at the u.s. mexico border seeking entry into the united states.   an executive order on border security signed by u.s. president donald trump days after he took office in january triggered a review of the program, putting on hold applications of more than 2,700 children who had been conditionally approved for entry into the united states. now those applications will be canceled. the bulk of the children approved for the program were from el salvador. immigration advocacy group kids in need of defense (kind) said that cancelling the program would lead to more children to try to find other means to enter the united states.  “these children have been repeatedly told by the u.s. government, including the trump administration, not to migrate to the united states due to safety concerns,” the organization said in a statement. “now this administration is cutting off the only authorized channel and leaving children no choice but to make the perilous journey to the united states.” the program allowed children under 21 years old with parents lawfully living in the united states to apply for a refugee resettlement interview before making the journey to the united states.  as of august 4, more than 1,500 children and eligible family members had arrived in the united states as refugees under the cam program, according to the state department.  children who did not qualify for refugee status and had no other means of reuniting with their parents in the united states  could also apply for entry under the program. they would be approved for parole for two years, allowing them to travel and stay in the united states and apply for work permits.   since its inception, more than 1,400 children were granted parole and allowed to travel to the united states. they included  1,110 from el salvador, 324 from honduras and 31 from guatemala, according to a spokesman from u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis).  now, they will have to re apply for parole once their two year term expires but will only be able to have it renewed if they can demonstrate “an urgent humanitarian or a significant public benefit reason” for them to stay, the federal register said. parole decisions would be determined on a case by case basis. more than 13,000 people have applied for the program since it began, the state department said. around 1 percent of applicants were denied both for refugee status and parole, according to the uscis spokesman. the refugee portion of the program will not be affected by wednesday’s termination and children stranded abroad can still apply as refugees.

" donald trump hasn’t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  a lawyer for the new york real estate developer demanded on wednesday the new york times retract a story in which two women accused trump of inappropriately touching them. if the newspaper did not comply, trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would “pursue all available actions and remedies,” the lawyer, marc kasowitz, said in a letter.  trump said at a rally on thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  an attorney for the times, david mccraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would “welcome the opportunity” to defend it in court. over the years, media outlets including the wall street journal, the village voice, the new york post and fortune magazine have reported receiving similar threats from trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. however, trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service westlaw, a unit of thomson reuters.       the last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. trump filed the case after the chicago tribune’s architecture critic called his proposed 150 story manhattan skyscraper an “atrocious, ugly monstrosity.” in 1985, a federal judge in manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a first amendment right to express his opinion. the skyscraper was never built. in the 32 years since trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. he was successful in one of those cases.  book author and former new york times reporter timothy o’brien defeated a trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after trump underwent a grueling deposition by o’brien’s lawyers.  trump’s suit against o’brien, which also named o’brien’s publisher, time warner book group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman’s net worth. a new jersey state judge found in 2009 that trump had not established o’brien’s actual malice.     former miss universe contestant sheena monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as “rigged.” the arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in manhattan in 2013. the court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014.     the same year, a san diego federal judge ruled tarla makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against trump university, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the better business bureau that trump university engaged in fraudulent business practices. the judge, gonzalo curiel, dismissed trump’s defamation claim.     trump’s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the reuters docket search may have missed.     u.s. courts have routinely deemed trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. that means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in “reckless disregard” for the truth. if trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. the new york times attorney, david mccraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. any trump claim will be difficult because trump’s accusers were on the record, said jane kirtley, a media law expert at university of minnesota law school. that would bolster the newspaper’s argument that it didn’t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. trump has vowed to “open up our libel laws,” if he wins the presidency on nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. in reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. court records show that trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a trump casino in indiana, were dismissed. one defamation suit against trump survived dismissal, however. stock analyst marvin roffman sued trump for $2 million in federal court in philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the taj mahal casino in atlantic city. roffman alleged trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. after a federal judge refused to toss the case, the trump organization settled in 1991. an attorney for roffman declined to comment.

" even before completing their overhaul of the u.s. tax code, republicans in washington have begun turning their attention to changes and possible cuts in the social safety net of government programs for the poor, children, elderly and disabled americans. president donald trump, house of representatives speaker paul ryan and other republican officials in recent remarks have made clear that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as they often call it, will be a top priority for them in 2018. “next year, we’re going to have to get back to entitlement reform,” ryan said on a radio talk show on wednesday. in republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created to assist the needy. democrats in washington have seized on ryan’s remarks, saying they show that republicans will attempt to pay for their tax overhaul, still incomplete on friday but nearing the finish line, by pivoting to seeking cuts in entitlement spending. republican plans to slash taxes on corporations and the rich would raise the federal budget deficit and u.s. debt by about $1 trillion over 10 years. for months, most republicans   who have long argued against running up the deficit   have downplayed that impact. but next year, democrats are predicting that republicans will return to a more customary message for them   that deficits and debt do matter, and that the best way to address that problem is by cutting federal spending. “the republicans’ next chapter will be, ‘oh, we have a deficit, we have to do something about it, let’s cut medicare and let’s cut medicaid,” democratic senator ben cardin told a news conference on thursday. negotiators from the senate and house on friday were still hammering out a final version of a republican tax bill that they want to send to trump by the end of the month to sign into law. crafting a single tax bill acceptable to both the senate and the house is proving difficult. though lawmakers are working on a tight timetable and talks could still falter, republican leaders are expressing confidence that a deal will be struck. “when they finish their work, members of both chambers will have the opportunity to pass this tax reform legislation and send it to president trump,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday, calling the tax legislation the “single most important thing” republicans can do to help the economy grow. the rival republican tax bills already passed by the house and senate both would deliver roughly $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade, with businesses and wealthy americans scoring the biggest gains. the bills would add about $1 trillion to the federal deficit over the same period, according to government estimates, even after taking into account projected economic growth. ‘pay as you go’ enacting the tax bill would trigger automatic cuts to a variety of programs, including medicare, due to a congressional budget rule that requires laws that increase the deficit to offset it with cuts to mandatory spending programs. the “pay as you go” rule applies to the medicare health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, but cuts to that program would be capped at 4 percent, or up to $28 billion in 2018, according to government estimates. medicaid, the social security retirement program, food stamps and other programs for the poor are exempt from such automatic cuts. to secure the republican votes needed to pass the senate’s version of tax legislation on dec. 2, ryan and mcconnell pledged not to allow automatic cuts to medicare. “this will not happen,” they said in a joint statement. congress must pass separate legislation to override automatic medicare cuts triggered by passage of the tax bill. as a presidential candidate last year, trump said he would not cut medicare, medicaid or social security. but ryan said on wednesday that in private conversations with the president, he believes he has started convincing trump that changes to medicare may be needed. trump last month said that “very shortly after taxes,” the white house would be “looking very strongly at welfare reform.” white house economic adviser kevin hassett said at a thursday event hosted by the pro business american council on capital formation group that the white house has been studying possible changes to the welfare system. democratic senator ron wyden said during debate last week on the senate tax bill that republican talk about entitlement or welfare reform was “code” for cutting medicaid, medicare and social security. “you’re going to hear a lot of lingo about entitlement reforms and welfare reforms,” wyden said on thursday.

" president donald trump’s eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic white house rival hillary clinton as part of moscow’s official support for his father, according to emails released on tuesday. the emails, released by donald trump jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that trump campaign officials welcomed russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over trump’s presidency and spurred investigations by the justice department and congress. the messages show that the younger trump was open to the prospect of “very high level and sensitive information” from a russian attorney that a go between described as “part of russia and its government’s support for mr. trump” ahead of a meeting on june 9, 2016.  ""if it's what you say i love it,"" trump jr. responded. he released the messages on twitter after the new york times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeck and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     in an interview with fox news, trump jr. said that trump’s campaign manager at the time, paul manafort, and son in law jared kushner, now a top white house adviser, also attended the meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya, who denies having kremlin ties. he said veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss russian sanctions. “in retrospect, i probably would have done things a little differently,” he said. “for me, this was opposition research.” nevertheless, the correspondence between him and rob goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for u.s. investigators probing whether trump’s campaign colluded with the kremlin. “the crown prosecutor of russia ... offered to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father,” goldstone wrote trump jr. on june 3. russia does not have a “crown prosecutor”   the equivalent title is prosecutor general. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that moscow sought to help trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from democratic party officials. “the conversation will now turn to whether president trump was personally involved or not. but the question of the campaign’s involvement appears settled now,” cornell law school professor jens david ohlin said in an interview. “the answer is yes.”  moscow has denied any interference, and trump says his campaign did not collude with russia. trump jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. he said he may have since had contact with other russians. “i’ve probably met with other people from russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,” he said on fox news. the news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration’s economic agenda. stocks and the dollar fell, while u.s. treasury securities gained ground. stocks later retraced most of their losses after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell pledged to keep lawmakers in washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. along with his younger brother eric, trump jr. oversees the trump organization, his father’s real estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the white house. “my son is a high quality person and i applaud his transparency,” trump said in a statement. the white house referred questions to lawyers for trump and his son. the emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say trump jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into democratic computer networks, or violated campaign finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. he is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  the senate intelligence committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a senate source, while the house of representatives intelligence committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel’s top democrat, representative adam schiff. “the american people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,” schiff told reporters. on fox news, trump jr. said he was “more than happy to cooperate with everyone.” senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley, a republican, asked the trump administration how veselnitskaya was able to enter the united states even though her authorization had expired. cnn reported that special counsel robert mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the justice department, also planned to look into the meeting. vice president mike pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became trump’s running mate later that summer. senator lindsey graham, a south carolina republican who is at times harshly critical of trump, told reporters: “this is very problematic. we cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody’s campaign and say: ‘we’d like to help you.’” ",0
" war might still be raging in the ruins of the philippine city of marawi, but the cleanup has already began.  under the guard of dozens of police and soldiers, about 100 of the 200,000 residents driven from their homes during 150 days of fighting have returned to start what will be a massive operation to clear the city of the debris of war. army trucks crawled through the deserted streets to take displaced people to safe areas of marawi, where echoes of gunfire and explosions could still be heard as troops sought to finish off the remaining maute group militants hemmed into a shrinking battle zone. they swept away trash, rocks and belongings scattered on streets, among them toys of children who fled when the pro islamic state rebels ran amok on may 23, setting buildings ablaze and ransacking churches and schools. spray painted on the shutter of one abandoned building reads  maute isis , a term used for the militant alliance.  this is very important for the normalization of marawi because we are responding to the call for them to return back, so we need to prepare,  said lieutenant colonel rosendo abad of a joint task force. defense officials say it could take until january before rebuilding can start, with the heart of the city littered with unexploded bombs and booby traps and buildings on the brink of collapse after months of government air strikes. military operations have cost 5 billion pesos ($97 million) and the government estimates it could be 10 times that much to rebuild marawi. the government on tuesday said 20 year  patriotic bonds  would be sold to generate 30 billion pesos. australia, the united states, singapore, russia, the world bank and the asian development bank are among the countries and organizations that have offered to help. but already close to the front lines of the effort is china, which has donated 47 heavy duty industrial vehicles, among them excavators, bulldozers, tractors, cement mixers and dump trucks.    those vehicles are on standby at the port in nearby iligan city, waiting for the guns to finally go silent before starting the task of restoring the country s only designated islamic city. omarshariff yassin, an engineer in charge of equipment at the department of public works and highways, said there was enough skilled manpower, but a lack of machinery.  before the chinese equipment arrived, we have 15 equipment in use. we have 17 units on standby,  he said.  the more, the better. what s happening is we lack equipment so we borrow from other regions. but we really need more.

" michigan governor rick snyder will testify at a house oversight committee hearing on march 17 on the flint, michigan, drinking water crisis, the panel said on thursday. snyder, a republican, has publicly apologized for the crisis in which thousands of children are believed to have ingested dangerous amounts of lead from the city’s water.  snyder has also said missteps by the federal environmental protection agency helped lead to the crisis in flint, a predominantly african american city of 100,000 about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of detroit.    under direction of a state appointed city manager in 2014, flint changed its water supply from detroit’s to the flint river, and the more caustic water helped to leach lead, a neurotoxin, from old pipes into the drinking water. the former city manager, darnell earley, and the former midwest epa chief, susan hedman, will also testify before the committee at separate hearing on march 15.

" puerto rico’s governor on wednesday signed an emergency bill allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse of the u.s. territory. the measure, which earlier passed puerto rico’s legislature, lets governor alejandro garcia padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the government development bank (gdb), the island’s primary fiscal agent.  “this legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs — providing essential services to our people — without fear of retribution,” garcia padilla said in a statement. puerto rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. wednesday’s emergency law was rushed into existence as the gdb faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on may 1. garcia padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. gdb and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. but the new law could spark “a new era of litigation” from creditors, said daniel hanson, an analyst with height securities. “we believe the overwhelming majority of puerto rican issuers have violated their creditors’ rights,” he said in a wednesday note. some gdb creditors on monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. the passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. stephen spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including oppenheimerfunds and franklin advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at prepa, the island’s power utility. that deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, “should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty,” spencer said in a statement. he said the law could “close the door to anyone extending new credit to puerto rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens’ needs.” in a statement on wednesday night, prepa executive director javier quintana mendez said the agreement “remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law.”  “we continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan,” quintana said. a second group of creditors holding debt issued by puerto rico’s sales tax authority, cofina, expressed support for the debt freeze bill, citing delays in legislative efforts by federal lawmakers in washington to address puerto rico’s crisis. “with entrenched private institutions obstructing the legislative process in washington, it is understandable that puerto rican leaders are taking steps to equip the island with the tools it needs,” susheel kirpalani, counsel to the cofina senior bondholders group at law firm quinn emanuel, said.    a rescue bill being drafted by the u.s. house of representatives natural resources committee so far uses u.s. bankruptcy rules as guidance for a solution, something many creditors oppose. hearings are expected next week in washington.   relations between puerto rico and its creditors are growing tenser as major debt payments in may and july loom.  on tuesday, some of puerto rico’s general obligation bondholders criticized the debt moratorium law, at the time still being debated by lawmakers, saying puerto rico was ignoring their offer to restructure debt by extending principal payments. garcia padilla appeared to fire back on wednesday, saying “our creditors have engaged in public relations efforts that contain falsehoods about their proposed ‘fixes’ – all of which are aimed at misinforming the public and dissuading congress from doing what is right for our 3.5 million american citizens.” puerto rico’s benchmark 2035 go bond 74514le86=msrb is down sharply since talk of a debt moratorium bill surfaced earlier this week. on wednesday the bond fell 2.45 points in price to bid 63.299, yielding 13.33 percent, according to municipal securities rulemaking board data.  “puerto rico’s problems stopped being legal problems and they’ve started being a math problem... at the end of the day puerto rico can’t pay,” said nicholas venditti, portfolio manager at thornburg investment management in santa fe, speaking at a luncheon for reporters in new york.

" u.s. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the u.s. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the nov. 8 election. but hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. they said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts. on oct. 7, the u.s. government formally accused russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations to interfere with the election process. u.s. officials familiar with hacking directed against american voting systems said evidence indicates that suspected russian government backed hackers have so far tried to attack voter registration databases operated by more than 20 states. tracing the attacks can be difficult but breaches of only two such databases have been confirmed, they said. the officials said there is no evidence that any hackers have succeeded in accessing equipment or databases used to record votes. many states use systems that would be difficult to hack or defraud, including paper ballots which initially are tallied by machines. u.s. elections are run by state and local officials, not the federal government. on nov. 8, votes will be cast in hundreds of thousands of polling stations in 9,000 different jurisdictions, according to the national association of secretaries of state. the u.s. officials declined to comment on republican candidate donald trump’s contention that the election is being “rigged.” trump said in the third and final presidential debate with democratic candidate hillary clinton on wednesday night that he would not say until the election results were known whether or not he would accept the outcome. trump and his campaign officials have repeatedly said that the potential for voter fraud remains high but they have not provided any evidence. on thursday, trump said he would accept the results of the election “if i win.” he said he reserved the “right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.”   clinton supporters said trump is unwittingly aiding an effort by russian president vladimir putin to undercut the credibility of the vote. washington and moscow are at odds over several issues, from russian involvement in the ukraine conflict, the war in syria and cyber attacks.  “trump does not even know he is being manipulated,” said michael morell, a former deputy cia director who has endorsed clinton. “trump is an unwitting agent of putin.” ",0
" donald trump’s success in the race for the white house may well depend on the support of republican evangelicals suspicious of the front runner’s more liberal side as he discloses his social views. a new york businessman who has never held public office, trump has had some success with evangelicals in states such as south carolina.  but there are signs of slippage on the eve of tuesday’s nominating contest in indiana, a conservative midwestern u.s. state that has voted republican in nine of the last 10 presidential elections. trump, 69, has taken stances on planned parenthood family clinics and gay and transgender rights that raise christian conservative concerns, including in such states as indiana where they make up a high proportion of voters. a new nbc/wall street journal/marist opinion poll shows trump with a wide lead in indiana, 49 percent, to 34 percent for his nearest rival, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, and 13 percent for ohio governor john kasich.     most previous indiana opinion polls showed a tighter race with trump leading cruz by only a few points. a trump win in the state could be crucial to his chances of securing the nomination but may also offer a gauge of whether he can rally evangelicals. cruz, 45, emphasizes his christian faith on the campaign trail. focused on indiana, he says trump is not an authentic republican. a new cruz advertisement brands trump and democratic front runner hillary clinton as two sides of the same coin. “both support the obamacare individual mandate. both support taxpayer funding for planned parenthood. both support letting transgender men go in little girls’ bathrooms,” it says.  trump has praised planned parenthood family clinics as having helped millions of women even if he opposes funding its abortion component. he backs letting transgender people use the bathroom “they feel is appropriate.” if evangelicals are unenthusiastic, they could sit out the nov. 8 general election, potentially handing the white house to former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton, the democratic front runner, or her rival, u.s. senator bernie sanders. “the fear is a lot of them are going to stay home,” said bob vander plaats, a leading evangelical activist in iowa. “you can’t win without our base.” trump rankled some social conservatives by criticizing north carolina’s controversial law that requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender of their birth. “the restroom thing is big with a lot of people,” said shan rutherford, a pastor in greenwood, indiana. rutherford said he was initially drawn to trump’s message, but was put off by his stance on social issues and his insulting demeanor on the campaign trail. rutherford, who backs cruz, said if the white house race came down to trump versus clinton, he might not vote. the pew research center says 45 percent of registered republican voters nationwide identify themselves as “born again” or “evangelical.” pew also found that only 44 percent of republicans view trump as a religious person. by contrast, 76 percent viewed cruz that way. cruz has assailed trump for his stance on the north carolina bathroom law. trump has said there have been few problems with transgender people using bathrooms. he also has said the question should be left to states to decide. cruz charges allowing grown men in bathrooms with little girls is “opening the door for predators.” on friday, cruz was endorsed by indiana governor mike pence, a social conservative who last year signed a bill that critics said could be used by business owners to deny services to same sex couples. trump has said he supports prohibiting companies from firing employees based on sexual orientation, although he has criticized last year’s u.s. supreme court decision legalizing same sex marriage. cruz has deployed his father, rafael cruz, an evangelical minister, as a surrogate in churches in indiana. a reuters/ipsos tracking poll showed 19 percent of respondents would not vote in a white house race between trump and clinton. but when filtered to those who attend church nearly every week, the number jumped to 28 percent. the party cannot afford a low turnout in november.  demographic trends in recent years have favored democrats, with the pool of republican voters, overwhelmingly white and older, steadily shrinking. eric houseman, a paramedic from indianapolis who attended a cruz rally in franklin, indiana, predicted trump would lose support through such missteps as inaccurately referring in january to a book of the bible as “two corinthians” rather than second corinthians or corinthians ii. “people are beginning to see he’s a lot of talk,” houseman said. upstate, ron johnson, pastor at the living stones church in crown point, votes republican but was adamant that he would not vote for trump. trump does not share his christian values, johnson said.     “i am not going to be part of the demise of this country,” he said. but mark burns, a south carolina pastor who has become a leading trump surrogate in the media, said trump’s appeal to evangelicals does not stem from the strength of his religious views. “we’re not voting for the next pastor. we’re voting for the next commander in chief,” burns said.

" former u.s. national security adviser michael flynn said in a statement on friday that his decision to plead guilty to lying to the fbi and to cooperate with an investigation into possible ties between russia and president donald trump’s administration was “made in the best interests of my family and of our country”. in the statement, which was issued by the law firm representing him, flynn also said it was “painful to endure” the “false accusations of ‘treason’ and other outrageous acts” over the past several months but that he recognized “that the actions i acknowledged in court today were wrong.”  ",0

" representatives of syria s warring sides sat just meters apart in separate rooms at u.n. peace talks on thursday, but mediator staffan de mistura stopped short of bringing them together in what diplomats had hoped might be a minor breakthrough. previous rounds of talks have gone almost nowhere, with de mistura shuttling between hotels and meeting multiple delegations separately. a newly unified opposition had raised the possibility of face to face talks to speed up the talks. although the two delegations were in the u.n. building concurrently, de mistura kept them apart, dashing between their respective meeting rooms on either side of a corridor.   we are having what we would call close proximity parallel meetings,  he told the opposition team, after making similar comments to the government delegation, promising to leave them in the hands of his deputy while he went to meet their enemies. after several hours of talks, chief government negotiator bashar al ja afari and his opposition counterpart nasr hariri left separately, without commenting to the media. hariri told reuters on wednesday that he was ready for direct talks and was prepared to negotiate with no preconditions to end the six year war. he said his first words to ja afari would be:  despite all of the crimes which have been done in syria, i hope that the regime can come ready to put the people of syria first.  if the two sides do meet, it will not be their first time in the same room. in february, de mistura infuriated ja afari by inviting both sides to a ceremony to inaugurate the talks.   on that occasion, as de mistura warmly embraced the opposition delegates, whom the government of president bashar al assad regards as terrorists, ja afari and his team walked out of the room without turning back. one western diplomat predicted fireworks if the two sides sat down to talk at last, almost seven years into syria s war, but he said the  sponsor  countries backing the talks   including russia and the united states   would then force them back to the table, and the pressure would gradually be released. a european diplomat expected the opposition to be  pragmatic and flexible  but there was little chance of a big breakthrough.   i think we need baby steps, and we ve made such little progress in the years gone by, largely because of the regime s reluctance to engage in this, so to make some small steps now and develop some momentum would be very helpful indeed.  hundreds of thousands of people have died in syria s civil war and more than 11 million have been driven from their homes. previous rounds of talks have faltered over the opposition s demand that assad leave power and his refusal to go. over the past two years, since russia joined the war on the government side, assad and his allies have recaptured all major towns and cities from the rebels. there has been some speculation ahead of this week s round of talks that the opposition could soften its demands in light of the government s success on the battlefield. however, at a meeting before the talks began, opposition delegates stuck by their demand that assad be excluded from any transitional government under a future peace deal.

"the arrogance of a ceo of a major company like starbucks, that would put his radical political opinions above the health of the company and the stockholders is astounding. the idea that howard schultz believed he could say starbucks would make hiring 10,000 refugees a priority, while so many americans are out of work, and it wouldn t harm the starbucks brand is beyond foolish howard schultz, the current ceo of starbucks, will step down from his role at the giant coffee chain next month.the move comes after his vow to hire thousands refugees in response to president donald trump s first travel ban appeared to hurt customer sentiment and dent their sales.trump supporters have called for a boycott of the chain since january 29, when schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years.schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the american dream was  being called into question  and that  the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack. he was also a public clinton supporter and prominent democrat, and even considered as a running mate for the democratic nominee at one point.almost immediately consumer perception levels took a hit as measured by yougov brandindex s buzz score, falling by two-thirds between january 29 and february 13.at the time, analysts at credit suisse said the coffee giant s move had a negative impact on recent sales, and could continue to hurt them in the near future.schultz, with an estimated net worth of $3.1billion, will remain at starbucks as executive chairman and will focus on strengthening the company s high-end coffee shops.schultz will be replaced as ceo by kevin johnson, starbucks  chief operating officer, on april 3, 2017, the seattle times reported. daily mail ",1
" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday current policy regarding transgender personnel serving in the military would remain in place until he advises president donald trump on how to implement his directive on a transgender ban. mattis said in a statement he would set up a panel of experts serving in the departments of defense and homeland security to provide recommendations on implementing the ban. he said he would advise the president after the panel reports it recommendations, and “in the interim, current policy with respect to currently serving members will remain in place.” trump signed a memorandum on friday directing the u.s. military not to accept transgender men and women as recruits and halting the use of government funds for sex reassignment surgeries for active personnel unless the process is already under way. a white house official who briefed reporters about the memo on friday declined to specify whether transgender men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. the memo called on mattis to submit a plan to trump by feb. 21, on how to implement the changes. mattis said he expects to issue other guidance “including any necessary interim adjustments to procedures, to ensure the continued combat readiness of the force until our final policy on this subject is issued.” trump’s directive created uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. the decision appealed to some in trump’s conservative political base while drawing criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) rights. civil rights groups filed two new lawsuits on monday challenging trump’s ban.

" six farmers were shot dead in the peruvian amazon by a group of masked men in an apparent dispute over land rights, a police officer and a tribal leader said on thursday. five bodies, one with hands and feet bound, had been thrown in a river and a sixth was found by the side of an unpaved road in the jungle region ucayali, police officer raul huari said. the victims were part of a community of peasant farmers that had refused to leave the lands they work on when pressured by oil palm growers, said robert guimaraes, the head of an indigenous federation in ucayali. witnesses testified that a group of between 30 and 40 men carrying shotguns tried to kill some 20 farmers altogether, huari said.  they said they showed up, surrounded them and just started shooting. fortunately, some managed to escape,  he said.  in my 24 years of working i ve never seen anything like this.  huari said the murders appeared to be linked to a land dispute, and a special police unit and prosecutors were carrying out investigations. the murders occurred on sept. 1, marking the three year anniversary of the killing of four indigenous activists who had faced threats from loggers in a different part of ucayali. after the 2014 murders, which came as peru was hosting a global environmental summit, the government promised to do more to protect remote amazonian villages that often lack land titles from violent clashes with squatters. guimaraes said native communities continue to face violent threats in ucayali and that no one has been convicted for the 2014 murders. peru s culture and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment. the native shipibo community of santa clara de uchunya, which lives near where the farmers killed, has tried to repel oil palm growers from their lands for years, said guimaraes.

" egypt s court of cassation upheld a five year jail sentence against prominent opposition activist alaa abdel fattah on wednesday, judicial sources said, a final ruling that cannot be appealed. abdel fattah, who has already served more than three years in prison, was jailed for protesting without permission in breach of a 2013 law that rights groups say effectively bans protests. the blogger and software engineer was a leading voice amongst the tech savvy liberal youth who initially led the 2011 uprising that ended the 30 year rule of hosni mubarak. he is one of several activists jailed since the military overthrew islamist president mohamed mursi in 2013 after mass protests and cracked down on his muslim brotherhood movement and secular democracy activists. the government has proscribed the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist organization but denies it has cracked down on secular democracy activists. prosecutors said abdel fattah was guilty of organizing a protest in november 2013 because he had promoted it on social media. rights groups say authorities were only able to prosecute abdel fattah, who did not attend the protest, by invoking a century old law of assembly that institutes collective punishment for all those involved in an illegal gathering.     they say the 1914 era law was in fact repealed in 1928 and courts should not be using it. they have sued the president over its use but there has been no response from the government. abdel fattah is also on trial in a separate case where he is accused of insulting the judiciary, a charge that carries up to three years in jail. a verdict is scheduled for december. egyptian rights activists say they face the worst crackdown in history under general turned president abdel fattah al sisi, who they accuse of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising. sisi, seen in the west as a bulwark against extremism in the region, has urged his critics to not judge egypt s rights records by western standards, saying security and economic prosperity are also human rights.

" the average premium for benchmark 2017 obamacare insurance plans sold on healthcare.gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016, the u.s. government said on monday, the biggest increase since the insurance first went on sale in 2013 for the following year. the average monthly premium for the benchmark plan is rising to $302 from $242 in 2016, the department of health and human services said. the agency attributed the large increase to insurers adjusting their premiums to reflect two years of cost data that became available. the government provides income based subsidies to about 85 percent of people enrolled, and those credits will increase with the higher premiums. it said 72 percent of consumers on healthcare.gov will find plans with a premium of less than $75 per month. large national insurers including aetna inc (aet.n), unitedhealth group inc (unh.n) and anthem inc (antm.n) have said they are losing money on the exchanges, created under president barack obama’s national healthcare reform law, because patient costs are higher than anticipated and enrollment is lower than forecast. both unitedhealth and aetna have pulled out of the exchanges for 2017. as a result, consumers will have fewer plans to choose from. in 2017, in five states there will be offerings from only one insurance company. the government expects average monthly 2017 enrollment of 11.4 million people, up about 1 million from 2016. obama acknowledged last week that the law is not working perfectly but said the problems could be fixed if lawmakers created a government run health insurance option that would help u.s. states where there is little or no competition. premium increases have become fodder for the presidential race, as republican candidate donald trump calls for the repeal of the affordable care act if he is elected and democrat hillary clinton calls for expanding it. the news “shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced .... mr. trump knows the only way to fix our nation’s failing health care system is complete and total reform,” said trump communications adviser jason miller. the government agency said the 2017 premium increase comes after two years of very low increases in the marketplace for the second lowest cost “silver” plan, the benchmark plan used to calculate cost sharing subsidies.  average premiums for the silver plan increased 2 percent in 2015 and were up 7 percent in 2016, the agency said. the figure reflects premiums on healthcare.gov, the federally run website that sells plans for about two thirds of the states. including four states and the district of columbia, which run their own insurance marketplaces, and those that have reported data, the average premium rose 22 percent, the agency said.

" in april 2014, the administration of president barack obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of jailed drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release and urging lawyers across the country to take on their cases. nearly two years later the program is struggling under a deluge of unprocessed cases, sparking concern within the administration and among justice reform advocates over the fate of what was meant to be legacy defining achievement for obama. more than 8,000 cases out of more than 44,000 federal inmates who applied have yet to make it to the u.s. department of justice (doj) for review, lawyers involved in the program told reuters. that is in addition to about 9,000 cases that are still pending at the doj, according to the department’s own figures. only 187 inmates have had their sentences commuted, far below the thousands expected by justice reform advocates and a tiny fraction of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the united states, which has the world’s highest incarceration rate. the administration said it wanted to decide on all the applications before obama’s term ends next january, when the program will automatically expire.  a senior doj official told reuters it is calling on the lawyers’ group — clemency project 2014 — to simply hand over the outstanding cases without further vetting, saying it is not working fast enough. so far, the group estimates it has handed over around 200 cases. but criminal justice experts say the administration itself should bear much of the blame. the idea to tap pro bono attorneys to help vet the cases originated with the doj, and critics say it should have prepared its own staff to handle the large volume of applications. “it’s unfair to criticize the volunteer group that you asked to help,” said rachel barkow, a criminal law professor at new york university who has studied clemency in u.s. prisons. she estimates that about 1,500 prisoners should be eligible for commutation, saying the 187 granted so far does not “fulfill the promise of the program.”  the doj declined to comment when asked for its response to such criticism. the delays have left prisoners like linda byrnes, 69, in limbo. “i thought clemency was for people like me,” byrnes told reuters through an electronic messaging system from a federal prison in alderson, west virginia. byrnes, who has spent 20 years in prison for distributing marijuana and has two years left on her sentence, was recently diagnosed with mouth cancer and has yet to hear whether she has been assigned a lawyer after submitting her application to clemency project in august 2014. obama, who has commuted more sentences than the past five presidents combined, has been a stern critic of harsh u.s. sentencing policies that he says have disproportionately burdened minorities. federal life sentences have fallen since obama took office, from 280 in fiscal year 2009 to 153 in 2013, according to the u.s. sentencing commission. about three quarters of the sentences were given to minorities and most were for non violent offences, the report said. clemency project 2014 said it does not comment publicly on the individuals it represents. the group vets the applications, writes the petitions and sends them to the justice department’s office of the pardon attorney, which oversees all pardons and sentence commutations and makes recommendations for the president’s approval.  so far, 25,000 of 34,000 applications received by clemency project have been rejected for failing to meet the basic criteria   no record of violence, no significant ties to a gang or drug cartel, good behavior in prison and completion of at least 10 years of sentence. about 10,000 inmates did not go through the clemency project and either applied directly to doj or through a paid attorney.  “it really would be a sad state of affairs if individuals who had asked for a lawyer weren’t considered in time because their petitions never reached the pardon attorney’s office,” a doj official told reuters on the condition of anonymity. (graphic on the clemency bottleneck: tmsnrt.rs/1vthxvt) a large number of mostly unqualified applications, a shortage of lawyers and the complexity of the cases have slowed progress, said cynthia roseberry, project manager for clemency project 2014. “there are a lot of gray areas,” said roseberry, who estimates it takes 30 days for one lawyer to review one case on average. “we’ve got to unpack each of these applicants to see specifically what factors affect them... and so that takes a little more time.” this includes finding pre sentencing reports for each case, determining if the person would have received a shorter sentence under current law and reviewing prison behavior records. roseberry said the group was unaware of any request from the justice department to hand over the pending applications. roseberry said the group’s initially slow pace has picked up in recent months.  the justice department declined to elaborate on its private communication with the lawyers. the pardon attorney’s office has brought in personnel from other parts of the department to help to speed up reviews of petitions, the doj official said. roseberry said about 3,000 applicants still need to be assigned to a lawyer, and that it was not certain whether the group will be able to submit all of the applications it has received before obama leaves office.  the group has more than 570 law firms and 30 law schools contributing to the effort. some rejected prisoners and those who have yet to hear a decision say they believe they would have had a better chance if they had sent their clemency petition directly to the government. josie ledezma was sentenced to life for conspiracy to transport cocaine and applied for clemency through clemency project 2014. she said she did not hear from them for six months and later learned that her assigned lawyer had shut down her legal practice. in january, nearly one year after applying, she was told clemency project 2014 could not help her and encouraged her to apply directly. “i wrote back and asked what was it that made me not qualify, but never got a response,” ledezma told reuters through an electronic messaging service for federal prisoners.

" u.s. president barack obama played down fallout from a u.s. abstention on a united nations resolution last month demanding an end to israeli settlements in occupied territory, saying it did not trigger a significant break in relations with israel. relations between the united states and israel, which have soured during obama’s eight years in office, reached a low point late last month when washington, defying pressure from longtime ally israel and president elect donald trump, declined to veto the u.n. resolution. after the dec. 23 vote, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described the u.s. move as “shameful” and accused the obama administration of colluding with the palestinians in the u.n. move against the settlements, which are considered illegal by most countries and described as illegitimate by washington. the white house denied the charge. “i don’t think it caused a major rupture in relations between the united states and israel,” obama said in an interview with the cbs program “60 minutes” airing on sunday night, according to a  transcript provided by cbs. “if you’re saying that prime minister netanyahu   got fired up, he’s been fired up repeatedly during the course of my presidency.” trump has pledged to pursue more pro israeli policies and to move the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as israel’s capital despite international objections. obama, who leaves office on friday, said israel’s settlements had made it harder to imagine a contiguous, effective palestinian state, seen as key to a long sought two state solution to end the israeli palestinian conflict.  the palestinians want an independent state in the west bank, gaza and east jerusalem, areas israel captured in a 1967 war. israel disputes that settlements are illegal and says their final status should be determined in any future talks on palestinian statehood. the last round of u.s. led peace talks between the israelis and palestinians collapsed in 2014.

" the kremlin said on friday that a u.s. decision to close russia’s san francisco consulate and buildings in washington and new york pushed bilateral ties further into a blind alley and fueled a spiral of tit for tat retaliatory measures. the united states on thursday ordered russia to close the facilities by sept. 2 in retaliation for moscow cutting the u.s. diplomatic presence in russia. “the new steps push our bilateral relations even further into a dead end and contradict other high level announcements ,” kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov told a news briefing when asked about the closures. “there have been words, but there’s no readiness to cooperate yet. this is about further escalating tensions. we regret this and will calmly think about how we might respond.” russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier on friday that moscow would respond harshly to u.s. measures it deemed damaging. moscow last month ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of russian diplomats in the united states, after congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against russia.

" several caribbean oil storage terminals that temporarily closed ahead of hurricane irma earlier this month have started making preparations in case they have to shut again due to hurricane maria, which was a rare category 5 storm on tuesday.  shippers and traders in the atlantic basin are struggling amid this year s very active storm season, which has seen seven hurricanes so far, four of them major hurricanes, defined as at least a category 3 on the five step saffir simpson scale. hurricane harvey hit the u.s. gulf coast s energy infrastructure at the end of august, halting a large portion of fuel exports to latin america. this month, hurricanes irma and maria have forced caribbean oil terminals and refineries to shut or slow operations, locking down millions of barrels stored. the scramble for shipments has led some shippers to divert tankers away from venezuela to feed latin american and caribbean countries desperate for fuel. maria on tuesday evening churned in the eastern caribbean about 60 miles (190 km) southeast of st. croix in the u.s. virgin islands, where a 13 million barrel oil storage facility is located. operators of other terminals in neighboring islands were monitoring the storm before making operational decisions. the hurricane brushed north of st. lucia and its path could also include st. eustatius, puerto rico and parts of the bahamas, islands where most of caribbean s 100 million barrel storage capacity is located. nustar energy s 13 million barrel statia terminal in st. eustatius remains shut since earlier this month after some of its tanks suffered damage from irma, according to the company. it also activated a hurricane response plan ahead of maria. statoil s south riding point terminal in the bahamas remained open on tuesday, though the company is monitoring the hurricane, it said in an email to reuters. u.s. based buckeye partners, the largest terminal operator in the caribbean, said in an emailed statement that it  initiated full plant shutdown procedures and suspended all marine terminal operations for its operations in yabucoa, puerto rico per our established hurricane preparedness plan.    buckeye temporarily shut its 23 million barrel bahamas terminal, its 6 million barrel puerto rico facility and its florida pipeline and terminal system earlier in september due to irma, but all of them were in the process of resuming operations last week. maria caused  mind boggling damage  in dominica, where it ripped off roofs across the island before pushing on toward the u.s. virgin islands and puerto rico on tuesday.

" the u.s. house of representatives passed legislation on wednesday giving congress the power to kill dozens of recently enacted rules in one fell swoop, as republicans charged ahead on their campaign to strip down federal regulations. it was the second time the republican dominated chamber took up legislation blocking “midnight rules,” those rolled out at the close of a president’s term. but the previous bill, introduced in november, had faced a certain veto from president barack obama, a democrat.  on its second day back in session, the house passed the bill on a vote of 238 to 184. the senate is expected to soon consider companion legislation, which could face a harder time because it would need eight votes from democrats.  under a law known as the congressional review act, congress has the right to review regulations for a certain period of time after they are issued. that means any federal regulation approved since may could be voided by the republican led congress once president elect donald trump moves into the white house and can sign off on their disapproval.  it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule, giving senate democrats little power to block a vote with a filibuster. as disapproving each regulation separately could span days, republicans would like to simply vote once to end a variety of new rules on energy, the environment, transportation, banking, finance, education and media ownership. many wall street regulations inspired by the 2007 09 financial crisis have only recently taken final form or are on the cusp of completion, putting them in the disapproval line of fire. that includes two pending rules on payday lending and mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts   both of which have raised republican ire. “because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters, they are much more prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new, incoming administration,” said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte before the vote. “waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for congress or a new administration to check adequately.” cutting down regulation was a near constant theme in republican political campaigns last year, and is part of house speaker paul ryan’s “better way” agenda. the house is also expected to consider soon legislation that would require a congressional vote of approval for any new regulation.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency’s scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether epa chief scott pruitt violated the agency’s policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by reuters on friday. lawyers for environmental group the sierra club had asked the epa’s office of inspector general to check whether pruitt violated policy when he told a cnbc interviewer on march 9, “i would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” the epa inspector general’s office responded to the sierra club on thursday in an email, saying it had referred the matter to the epa’s scientific integrity officer, francesca grifo, for review. “if after the sio review, she concludes there is some aspect of the letter itself, or her findings or conclusions that she believes are appropriate for further consideration by the oig, she will so notify the oig,” the email stated. a spokeswoman for the epa defended pruitt’s comments. “administrator pruitt makes no apologies for having a candid dialogue about climate science and commonsense regulations that will protect our environment, without creating unnecessary regulatory burdens that kill jobs,” said liz bowman in an emailed statement. “differing views and opinions on scientific and technical matters is a legitimate and necessary part of epa’s decision making process, which is consistent with epa’s scientific integrity policy that was in place even during the obama administration,” she added.  the epa website says its scientific integrity policy requires epa officials and staff to ensure the agency’s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. an overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. the request by sierra club ramps up tension between the u.s. environmental movement and the administration of president donald trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the u.s. economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. grifo is a biologist who was hired by former president barack obama’s administration. before she joined the epa in late 2013, she oversaw scientific integrity at the union of concerned scientists, a non partisan group advocating stronger environmental protections.  pruitt, a former attorney general for oklahoma, sued the epa more than a dozen times over its regulations as top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.

" the u.s. senate voted on tuesday to confirm attorney jay clayton to head the securities and exchange commission, the agency tasked with policing and writing rules for wall street. in a 61 37 vote, the senate approved the nomination, with some moderate democrats joining their republican colleagues in supporting his confirmation. clayton could be officially sworn in as sec chairman as soon as thursday. the white house still must complete some paperwork, including an action by president trump to formally designate him as sec chairman. clayton is a longtime partner at law firm sullivan & cromwell who specializes in advising clients on public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital raising efforts.  clayton worked on the initial public offering of alibaba group holding company, and has also represented goldman sachs, where his wife gretchen works.  she is now expected to step down from her post, a move that will make it easier for her husband to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. “i look forward to working closely with my fellow commissioners and the dedicated career staff at the sec to serve the american public and advance the sec’s important mission,” clayton said in a statement. many current and former sec staffers are optimistic about clayton’s leadership, and clayton is expected to focus some of his efforts on looking for ways to ease regulatory burdens that might hinder companies from raising capital. but in the debate leading up to the senate vote on tuesday, more progressive leaning democrats said they were concerned his close ties to wall street will create too many conflicts and may lead to weaker oversight. “mr. clayton’s law firm and former clients will create a steady stream of conflicts for him, forcing him to recuse himself in cases involving former clients for two of the four years he could serve as chair,” said ohio democrat sherrod brown, the ranking member of the senate banking committee.  “he will be sitting on the sidelines of potential enforcement actions against some of the biggest wall street banks   goldman sachs, deutsche bank, royal bank of canada, and ubs,” he added.

" sweden will start negotiations on a $1.2 billion raytheon co  patriot air defense missile system, as interest in missile defense systems strengthens amid heightened regional tensions and ballistic missile technology improves globally.  the swedish government said on tuesday negotiations with the u.s. company will target delivery beginning in 2020, and for the system to be operational by 2025 at the latest. iran, north korea and russia, among others, have made advancements in their missile technology.  raytheon said,  sweden s announcement brings them closer to joining the growing group of european nations depending on the combat proven patriot to defend against ballistic and cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft and drones.  the swedish government said,  based on this tender and the decision of the riksdag (the swedish parliament) on the proposal to acquire a new medium range air defense system in the 2018 budget bill, the government will make a final decision on the acquisition during 2018.  lockheed martin corp, the pentagon s no. 1 weapons supplier, said in august its customers want to defend themselves against possible incoming missile attacks and are increasingly asking about missile defense systems. raytheon has built more than 220 patriot fire units and delivered them to customers in 13 nations including the netherlands and germany.    the swedish defense materiel administration (fmv) has been authorized to send a l\letter of request to the united states, and to enter into negotiations for procurement of the patriot system. the contract value is estimated to exceed 10 billion swedish crowns ($1.2 billion), fmv said in a statement. u.s. soldiers and german airmen fired the first of dozens of live patriot and stinger missiles on monday as part of an exercise at a nato base in crete aimed at strengthening the response to possible attacks from russia or other countries. the exercise, which continues through thursday on the greek island, will include a series of emerging  real world threats  such as the use of drones, electronic warfare and electromagnetic pulses, u.s. army colonel david shank, commander of the 10th army air and missile defense command, told reuters. the exercises come amid a big push by the united states, germany and other nato members to rebuild short range air defense systems after the shock of russia s annexation of the crimea region of ukraine and its support of separatists in the donbass region of ukraine.

" u.s. judge james robart emerged from relative obscurity on saturday as the first jurist to come under fire from the president since he took office after his temporary order to lift donald trump’s immigration ban. in a reaction that went viral on twitter, trump called the 69 year old robart a “so called judge” whose “ridiculous” opinion “essentially takes law enforcement away from our country.” to those who know robart, who has been on the federal bench in seattle for more than a decade after his appointment by another republican, president george w. bush, the ensuing drama surrounding the move was a far cry from the judge’s standard. “he is relatively apolitical,” said douglas adkins, a private equity investor and former investment banker who has known robart since childhood. “he’s not a conservative or a liberal. he’s a man interested in the law and fairness.” late on friday, robart grabbed national headlines with his decision to temporarily lift trump’s week old travel ban for citizens of seven mainly muslim countries and refugees. his ruling was just a first step in considering the merits of the case challenging the ban. the justice department on saturday filed a formal notice that it intends to appeal the ruling. as a candidate, trump had criticized federal judge gonzalo curiel, who was overseeing a case against his trump university   arguing curiel could not be impartial because of his mexican heritage and trump’s vow to crack down on mexican immigrants. but by lashing out at robart as president, trump’s anti judiciary stance takes on new importance: it hits at the very heart of the checks and balances system meant to protect the country from government abuse of power.         coincidentally, in his wide reaching ruling on friday, robart emphasized that the three branches of government   the executive branch, congress and the judiciary   should function as equals. “the work of the judiciary, and this court, is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country’s laws, and more importantly, our constitution,” robart wrote.  reached by email, robart declined to comment on trump’s tweets. a graduate of whitman college in walla walla, washington, and georgetown university law center, robart spent 30 years in private practice at the law firm now known as lane powell, before being appointed to the bench by bush in 2004. adkins said robart and his wife have no children but have been foster parents to several immigrant children over the years, primarily from southeast asia. robart could not be reached for comment.  the judge served in the past as the president of the seattle children’s home and was a former trustee of the children’s home society of washington, according to his official biography on the federal court website. those organizations provide mental health services for at risk youth and help troubled families. “his involvement with children may have helped contribute to his understanding of the people impacted by this ruling but would not have shaped his interpretation of the rule of law,” said paul lawrence, who was one of the attorneys who filed an amicus brief backing washington state in the immigration case. during his confirmation hearing, robart recalled providing pro bono legal services early in his career to “people who in many times felt that the legal system was stacked against them.” he said he learned that the law “could be, if properly used, an opportunity for them to seek redress if they had been wronged,” according to a transcript of the testimony. often sporting bow ties with his black robes, robart is known for saying from the bench in 2016 that “black lives matter.” he cited the statement popularized by protesters during a hearing about a 2012 consent decree with the federal government that required the seattle police department to address allegations of bias and excessive force. in 2011, robart put a temporary hold on a state rule change that would have cut government funding for disabled children and families in washington.  “when faced with a conflict between the financial and budgetary concerns ... and the preventable human suffering,” robart wrote in that opinion, “the balance of hardships tips in the favor of preventing human suffering.” adkins said he thought his friend would be able to take trump’s attacks in stride. “his view is that criticism is important,” said adkins.

" if you haven’t heard a lot about what hillary clinton thinks of a string of controversial comments by donald trump that have generated round the clock coverage on cable news broadcasts, there is a reason – it’s by design. since becoming the democratic nominee last month, clinton has been touring toy manufacturers, visiting tie makers and dropping in on public health clinics, where if she mentions trump at all, it is usually to contrast their policies. her swift condemnation at a wednesday campaign rally of trump’s remark that gun rights activists could stop her from nominating liberal u.s. supreme court justices was a rare instance where she has directly engaged her republican rival in the 2016 race for the white house. aides say clinton’s strategy is simple: let trump be trump. trump has suffered a series of missteps over the past two weeks that go beyond his remarks on gun rights activists, which he later accused the media of deliberately misinterpreting. he has tangled with party leaders, clashed with the parents of a fallen muslim american army captain and this week accused clinton, a former secretary of state, and president barack obama of “founding” the islamic state militant group. on friday, he said he was just being sarcastic when he made that remark.  “there is an adage in politics:  don’t get in the way of a train wreck,” said democratic strategist bob shrum, a top campaign aide to presidential candidates al gore in 2000 and john kerry in 2004. clinton’s advisers say they see little benefit in her going toe to toe with trump over every personal accusation, generating sound bites that would dominate cable news broadcasts. rather, they are happy for him to be embroiled in controversy while clinton focuses on policy. trump’s campaign declined to comment for this story, but the new york real estate developer has accused the national media of bias toward clinton. he re posted a supporter’s tweet on friday that said the “corrupt media” was deliberately exaggerating his remarks to favor his democratic opponent.  trump has slipped in opinion polls, and worried republican party leaders have urged him to stop making off the cuff inflammatory statements that generate blanket, often negative, media coverage and distract from efforts to highlight what they see as clinton’s many shortcomings. “he’s sucking all the oxygen out of the room to his own detriment,” said republican strategist and trump supporter ford o’connell. it’s not enough to dominate media coverage, he needs to “win” it, o’connell said. trump has boasted that the news coverage he generates means he does not have to spend as much on campaign ads, but political veterans say he is squandering the attention and missing opportunities to win over undecided voters. for example, trump gave an economic speech on monday that was meant to help his campaign regain momentum, but it was quickly eclipsed by the fallout over his remarks on gun rights activists. clinton, meanwhile, has been busy courting local media in must win states. her national press pool, which seldom gets to question the candidate, often waits as she conducts interviews with local news outlets. she has granted few recent interviews to national outlets and rarely holds press conferences, a strategy her critics say is calculated to avoid questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, and the relationship between her family’s global charity, the clinton foundation, and the state department. clinton, who has said she is one of the most transparent presidential candidates in history, has acknowledged her use of the private email server was a mistake but said she properly handled all classified information. she has denied any improper links between the foundation and the state department. in interviews with local outlets, clinton is more likely to face questions about job creation, public health and raising wages   all parts of her platform that she is keen to discuss. in florida, a crucial battleground state, republican lobbyist gus corbella says the contrast between the local coverage of clinton’s campaign stops there and trump’s events has been stark. “clinton’s campaign seems to have the more disciplined approach,” corbella said. “the rollout that day is on a specific event she’s attending, a message she’s trying to deliver. whereas on the trump side, it’s what crazy thing did he say today and the response to that.” after clinton’s visit last week to a tie maker in colorado, the lead story on the front page of the denver post was “clinton pledges millions of jobs.” trump also featured on the front page, but in a smaller story about “damage control” in his troubled campaign.

" a former british spy who compiled a dossier with allegations that russia helped donald trump in the 2016 u.s. presidential election has met with investigators working for the special counsel on the case, a source familiar with the contact said on thursday. christopher steele, a former senior operative for mi6, the british foreign intelligence agency, met representatives of special counsel robert mueller’s team “recently,” said the source, who declined to provide further details. a spokesman for mueller declined comment. while president trump and some of his supporters have dismissed the dossier as “fake news”, two sources familiar with mueller’s probe and a senate intelligence committee investigation of suspected russian meddling in the election said on thursday that investigators have not dismissed it. russia has repeatedly denied any interference in last november’s election won by businessman trump, a republican. senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr said on wednesday that his panel had made several attempts to contact steele and to meet him and “those offers have gone unaccepted.” “the committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub sources,” burr said. the meeting between members of mueller’s team and steele was first reported by cnn earlier on thursday.     reuters reported on wednesday that mueller’s team had taken over multiple strands of fbi investigations related to possible financial and personal links between trump, his associates and russia. steele met with fbi representatives before the election to discuss his findings on trump and russia. a copy of his so called trump dossier was posted publicly on the buzzfeed website in january. although several news organizations, including reuters, were briefed on steele’s dossier, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. the information on trump collected by steele, whom officials say was one of mi6’s most respected russia hands, was laid out last year in political “opposition research” initially financed by supporters of one of trump’s republican primary election opponents. after trump won the republican nomination in july, backers of democratic candidate hillary clinton picked up the support of steele’s work.

" israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on monday he was committed to working with u.s. president donald trump to advance  peace efforts with the palestinians and with the broader arab world. netanyahu made the pledge in a speech to the largest u.s. pro israel lobbying group at a time when the trump administration is seeking agreement with his right wing government on limiting settlement construction on land the palestinians want for a state, part of a u.s. bid to resume long stalled peace negotiations. but netanyahu, speaking via satellite link from jerusalem, avoided any mention of the delicate discussions and stopped short of reiterating a commitment to a two state solution to the decades old israeli palestinian conflict. “israel’s hand and my hand is extended to all of our neighbors in peace,” netanyahu told the annual convention of the american israel public affairs committee, or aipac. “israel is committed to working with president trump to advance peace with the palestinians and with all our neighbors.” but he repeated his demand that the palestinians recognize israel as a jewish state, something they have refused to do. netanyahu heaped praise on trump, who has set a more positive tone with israel than his democratic predecessor, barack obama, who often clashed with the israeli leader. he thanked the new republican president for a recent u.s. budget request that “leaves military aid to israel fully funded.” he also expressed confidence in a u.s. israeli partnership for preventing tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, following its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and  for “confronting iran’s aggression in the region.” addressing aipac later on monday, nikki haley, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, vowed that the trump administration would watch iran “like a hawk” to be sure it sticks to the nuclear deal. the accord, which netanyahu opposed and trump denounced during his campaign, gave tehran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program. on the settlements issue, a round of u.s. israeli talks ended last thursday without agreement. gaps remain over how far the building restrictions could go, according to people close to the talks. netanyahu’s coalition is grappling with divisions that have sparked speculation that he could seek early elections. many israelis had expected trump, because of his pro israel campaign rhetoric, to give a green light for settlement expansion in the occupied west bank. but trump unexpectedly urged netanyahu last month to “hold back on settlements for a little bit.” there is skepticism in the united states and middle east over the chances for restarting israeli palestinian diplomacy.    peace talks have been frozen since 2014. most countries consider israeli settlements, built on land captured in a 1967 war, to be illegal. israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests. trump has expressed ambivalence about a two state solution, the mainstay of u.s. policy for the past two decades, but he recently invited palestinian president mahmoud abbas to visit.

" milwaukee county sheriff david clarke, an african american who became a staunch critic of the “black lives matter” movement and supported donald trump’s presidential campaign, said on wednesday he has accepted a job as assistant secretary of the u.s. department of homeland security. clarke told radio station wisn in milwaukee that he would leave his post as sheriff next month to join the department of homeland security. the post would not require senate confirmation. department of homeland security spokeswoman jenny burke said no announcement on clarke had been made, and said the role of assistant secretary must be made official by the secretary of the department.  clarke said on wisn’s vicki mckenna show, “i’ll be a liaison with state and local governments and with the private sector, and one that’s really near and dear to me   liaison with the state, local and tribal law enforcement,” according to an online recording of the show posted on the station’s website. clarke’s office and spokeswoman in milwaukee could not be reached for comment on wednesday. he said on the radio show that he would work with local agencies that can feel neglected or ignored by the federal government. the department of homeland security, created after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on new york and the pentagon, includes agencies that handle customs, border protection and immigration, the coast guard, the transportation security administration and the secret service. the black lives matter movement grew out of protests over a number of police killings of unarmed black men in various parts of the united states. the movement has challenged the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers.  clarke has labeled members of the movement “subhuman creeps” and called for its eradication. he spoke in support of trump at the republican national convention in cleveland last july. critics have faulted clarke for his management of a milwaukee county jail where a mentally ill man died in 2016 of dehydration. an inquest jury recommended that seven employees of the jail be criminally charged. democratic senator kamala harris of california called clarke’s appointment “a disgrace.” “sheriff david clarke’s unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve,” harris said in a tweet.

" the ethics committee of the u.s. house of representatives said on tuesday it would continue to investigate possible conflicts of interest by representative alan grayson, a florida democrat and liberal firebrand running for the senate seat soon to be vacated by marco rubio.      the possible conflicts of interest relate to grayson’s roles as both a hedge fund manager and a member of congress. the committee in a statement said the matter needed further review; it gave no time frame for completion. grayson has denied any wrongdoing. in a statement tuesday, his campaign called the ethics probe a “political witch hunt.” the extension means the issue will still hover over a race that is seen as key to democrats’ bid to wrest control of the senate from republicans in november’s elections. the primary is in august. the new york times reported in february that emails and the fund’s marketing documents showed grayson had promoted his international travels, some with congressional delegations, to solicit business for the fund, in possible violation of house ethics rules.  “the larger picture here is that the washington political establishment has decided who their favored candidate is, and it’s not rep. grayson,” the statement from grayson’s campaign said. top democrats have tried to get grayson to drop out of the florida senate race because of the questions about the hedge fund, throwing their support to democratic opponent representative patrick murphy. president barack obama has endorsed murphy, and vice president joe biden has campaigned with murphy. senate democratic leader harry reid said earlier this year that grayson’s actions had disgraced congress and that he should leave the senate race immediately.  but grayson has been endorsed by some grassroots liberal groups who appreciate his outspokenness. one of his more famous lines, delivered during the obamacare debate in 2009, was that the republican health care plan for america amounted to “don’t get sick,” and if you do, “die quickly.” the new york times reported that grayson had created the hedge fund in 2011 after losing a race for re election to congress, and kept it open after he was re elected in 2012. according to filings with the securities and exchange, the fund had been called the grayson fund, but grayson changed the name to sibylline fund lp. the times reported the fund had closed branches previously located in the cayman islands. rubio, who recently ended a campaign for the republican presidential nomination, leaves the senate after this year after just one term. republicans seeking the seat include representatives ron desantis and david jolly.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency said that a freeze  handed down by president donald trump’s white house on new contracts and grants that has led to fears of delays in toxic pollution cleanups would be completely reversed on friday or at latest on monday.  the freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about potential delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of americans at risk. the agency allocates nearly $4 billion annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing air and water for toxins. doug ericksen, a former washington state senator who is the epa’s new communications director, said in an email that $3.8 billion of the $3.9 billion in contracts and grants was cleared on wednesday night. “the remainder should be cleared today. there might be a very small number left for monday, but not likely.”  the epa has not issued any news releases about ending the freeze, which has led to uncertainty.  on thursday, a day after ericksen said the vast majority of the contracts and grants were cleared, five democratic senators, including edward markey and tom carper, wrote a letter to trump “with alarm” urging him to “immediately reverse this troubling action.”     ericksen said they should rest assured. “no projects are delayed or cut. none. not sure how much more clear i can be,” he said in the email.  u.s. representative dan kildee from flint, michigan, home to the lead poisoning crisis in drinking water, also wrote to trump this week asking when the freeze would be lifted. an epa spokeswoman told kildee’s office that $100 million in congressional aid would not be affected by the freeze. but kildee was uncertain whether contracts and grants centering on testing and expertise about the lead crisis would be delayed. a kildee spokesman said on friday that the congressman had still not gotten a written response to his letter from trump or the epa.  the epa sent employees an internal memo late on friday, seen by reuters that said it was making progress in lifting the freeze, which it called standard practice during a transition. “as of today, we have completed review of our grant programs,” the memo said. “the review of contracts is nearly complete, with very few contracts still under review,” the memo said, without elaborating.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump hit out at former scottish first minister alex salmond on thursday, calling him “an embarrassment” as he defended his ownership of a prestigious scottish golf course.  the attack is the latest in a feud between the pair, stemming from trump’s objection in 2013 to a scottish government approved offshore wind farm project near one of his golf courses.  trump has found himself under scrutiny from british politicians more generally after they voted last week to debate a call to ban him from the uk due to public outcry over his proposal to stop muslims entering the united states. calling salmond a “stupid man”, trump accused him of destroying landscapes by supporting wind farm projects and said he “disgracefully” released from prison a libyan convicted of blowing up pan am flight 103 over the scottish town of lockerbie in 1988. “alex salmond is an embarrassment to scotland,” he said. trump’s statement was issued as a response to salmond, who had said on wednesday on a radio program that it would be better for scotland if the billionaire developer and former reality tv star were not the owner of the turnberry golf course in the south west of the country.  salmond, a campaigner for scotland’s independence from the united kingdom, also said he would support britain’s interior minister theresa may if she did issue trump with a travel ban, ending his comments by suggesting that trump wore a toupee.  in a previous row, trump had called salmond a “has been and totally irrelevant”.  half scottish trump, who speaks proudly of his gaelic heritage, defended his ownership of turnberry, one of the two golf resorts he owns in scotland, saying he was spending 200 million pounds ($290 million)on a revamp. should britain ban him from entering, trump has threatened to cancel 700 million pounds of planned investments in scotland.  “his response to any suggested ban has not changed,” a spokeswoman for trump said on thursday.

" mexico s finance minister resigned on monday to seek the 2018 presidential nomination of the ruling party, anticipating a major break with tradition as it seeks outside help to clean up its tarnished image and stay in office for another six years. jose antonio meade had been widely expected to run for the centrist institutional revolutionary party (pri), whose credibility has been seriously undermined by corruption scandals, gang violence and accusations of electoral fraud. meade is not a pri member, and his reputation for honesty has persuaded many party grandees that he is the best bet to take on the front runner in the july 2018 presidential race, the leftist former mayor of mexico city, andres manuel lopez obrador. pri hopefuls can register from dec. 3, and early indications suggested meade would not face any major challengers. the pri will formally elect its candidate on feb. 18. he was warmly received by party members on a whistle stop tour of organizations affiliated to the pri in mexico city on monday. all the other early pri favorites for the presidency expressed their support for him on twitter. soft spoken and measured in tone, meade, 48 first entered the cabinet under the previous center right administration of the national action party, or pan. his ability to draw votes from other parties is viewed as one of his principal assets.  he ll be an attractive candidate for those who don t necessarily support the pri,  tweeted daniel karam, who headed the mexican social security institute during meade s initial cabinet stint under the pan. eager to mend its reputation, the pri changed its statutes in august to make it easier for outsiders to run for the job the party has held for most of the past century. at an event at his official residence, president enrique pena nieto said harvard educated former world bank official jose antonio gonzalez anaya would leave his job as chief executive of state oil company pemex to replace meade in the finance ministry. in a brief address at the ministry afterward, meade said he would run for the presidency  after 20 years of serving my country continuously with integrity and honesty.  lopez obrador, twice runner up for the presidency, has railed relentlessly for years against government graft. he quickly lashed out on twitter against the pri as  corrupt  and  predictable  after meade made his announcement. meade remains unknown to much of the mexican public, and in opinion polls he lags far behind the veteran lopez obrador, who has sought to characterize all of the main opposition parties as corrupt extensions of the pri. serving as energy, then finance minister in 2011, meade became foreign minister when pena nieto took office in december 2012. he later switched to the social development ministry before returning to the finance ministry last year. seen by allies as a discreet and diplomatic official, meade s grasp of finance and economics is matched by few in mexico, and his academic career includes degrees in law and economics as well as an economics doctorate from yale. crucially, argue his supporters, he has avoided the damaging scandals that have engulfed the pri under pena nieto, who cannot constitutionally seek a second six year term.       i thank (meade) for his dedication and commitment and i wish him success in the project he has decided to undertake,  pena nieto said at the event at his los pinos residence. tv images showed meade driving toward los pinos behind the wheel of a modest compact car, a frequent prop among mexican politicians seeking to project the common touch. gonzalez anaya, who is related by marriage to influential former president carlos salinas de gortari, will be replaced at pemex by carlos trevino, a senior executive at the company.

" u.s. senator bernie sanders will focus on getting liberal candidates elected to state and local offices ahead of next year’s midterm elections rather than on higher profile u.s. congressional races, to help build a national progressive movement from the ground up. sanders said he hoped his emphasis on school boards, city councils and statehouses will help support the next generation of activist progressive candidates and dovetail with the mission of our revolution, a nonprofit political group run by former staffers and volunteers for his 2016 presidential campaign. “i look at politics a little bit differently than some of my colleagues in the sense that i believe that we need to build a national grassroots movement,” sanders told reuters in an interview on tuesday. “so i think my emphasis is going to be more on grassroots politics,” he added. sanders, an independent in the u.s. senate, galvanized the democratic party’s progressive wing last year with his primary challenge against eventual nominee hillary clinton.  sanders, 76, drew huge crowds and won 43 percent of democratic primary voters with his calls to end the influence of big money in politics, create medicare for all healthcare and establish free tuition at public universities. democrats are arguing over the best way out of a deep electoral rut capped by clinton’s presidential election defeat by republican donald trump. the party lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats nationally during former president barack obama’s two terms in the white house, and hold the fewest governor’s offices in nearly a century. “there is an absolute need for the development of a new generation of leadership,” said democratic strategist erik smith, adding that current republican victories are the result of grassroots investment in the 1980s. sanders said the type of progressive policies he espoused during his campaign are winning support around the country.  he traveled to georgia last month to campaign for vincent fort, a state senator running for atlanta mayor. sanders called fort, who supports a $15 per hour minimum wage and the expansion of the medicaid health insurance program for the poor and disabled, a “life long progressive.” sanders also pointed to the success of local candidates backed by our revolution, including randall woodfin, a school board president who triumphed in a crowded field to oust the incumbent democratic mayor of birmingham, alabama, and chokwe antar lumumba, who defeated an incumbent and a state senator to become the democratic nominee for mayor in jackson, mississippi. “democrats suffer from thin bench syndrome in so many states,” said matt barron, a massachusetts democratic strategist focusing on rural issues.  barron pointed out that in mississippi, just one of eight statewide offices is held by a democrat and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by republicans. “there is almost nobody to run,” he said. sanders said he plans to travel to somerville, massachusetts, next week to support a half dozen candidates in city council races. “if you look at cities and town and school boards, what you see all over the country is that we are in fact making progress,” sanders said. while sanders frequently exasperated clinton and her supporters, his policy prescriptions won support from many democrats and the party has shifted to the left since clinton’s defeat. many potential 2020 democratic presidential candidates back sanders’ medicare for all proposal.     republicans hold 52 seats in the 100 member u.s. senate, and democrats and independents will be defending 25 of the 34 seats up for re election in 2018. in the u.s. house of representatives, democrats hold 194 of 435 seats and all are up for re election next year.

" the saudi riyal fell against the u.s. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on thursday after the u.s. congress voted to allow relatives of victims of the sept. 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia.  any legal action could take years to wind through the u.s. court system, and analysts said there might be little if any impact on the saudi economy or state finances. but the decision by congress was an unwelcome reminder of political and financial pressures on riyadh as low oil prices strain its budget. saudi arabia has been preparing to make its first international issue of sovereign bonds next month to raise $10 billion or more, but some gulf bankers said the issue might now be delayed to give investors time to digest the news. similarly, the legal threat could make riyadh less likely to choose new york for a listing of shares in national oil giant saudi aramco. an offer of aramco shares is expected as soon as 2017, possibly raising tens of billions of dollars, and saudi officials have said they are considering several foreign bourses. the senate and house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on wednesday to override president barack obama’s veto of legislation granting an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u.s. soil. this clears the way for attempts to seek damages from the saudi government. riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the united states in 2001. fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals. one year dollar/riyal forwards, which are trades scheduled to take place 12 months from now, were at 550 points early on thursday, up from wednesday’s close of 330 points. they rose as far as an eight week high of 625 points. the saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks. “in the short term you might have volatility but the legislation will take a decade to have a result, so markets will calm down,” predicted a banker involved in gulf currency trade, adding the main impact might be to saddle the saudi government with tens of millions of dollars in annual legal fees. five year saudi credit default swaps, used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default, rose slightly to 157 points from 152, and the saudi stock market fell slightly. but the price of state run saudi electricity co’s april 2023 dollar islamic bond, one of the few outstanding international bonds from saudi arabia, did not move significantly. some analysts speculated that trade and investment ties between saudi arabia and the united states could be hurt. the kingdom owns $96.5 billion of u.s. treasury bonds, according to the latest official u.s. data, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other u.s. assets and bank accounts. “from a saudi foreign ministry perspective, there will be a review of investment policy and that could move the kingdom down a different path, which could include diversification away from u.s. treasuries,” the gulf banker said. in may, saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir said the proposed u.s. law “would cause an erosion of investor confidence” in the united states, though he added that riyadh was not threatening to pull its money out of the country. riyadh has been selling several billion dollars in u.s. bonds each month to cover its budget deficit, and bankers think it is unlikely to step this up as a result of the congress vote. that is because few other markets or currencies provide the combination of liquidity and security of the $13 trillion u.s. treasury market. saudi arabia has also been eagerly courting investment by top u.s. companies such as general electric co to help diversify its economy beyond oil, and a trade or investment war with the united states could damage its economic reform drive. “the u.s. is a market where the saudis will continue to invest. i don’t think they’ll adopt a knee jerk reaction to their investments,” said john sfakianakis, economist with the jeddah based gulf research centre. “if it makes sense, they will continue to keep their assets in the united states.” ",0
" u.s. senator dick durbin, the chamber’s second ranking democrat, expressed deep reservations on tuesday with a puerto rico debt relief bill being debated by a house of representatives panel this week. “i want to see the final product. the initial draft, i have some real problems with it,” the illinois lawmaker told reporters. he added that some other democrats had also expressed strong reservations with the measure. durbin said he was concerned that the bill that could move through the house would cut the minimum wage and overtime pay for some puerto ricans and fail to increase federal payments for medicare and medicaid, the healthcare programs for the elderly, poor and disabled, on the island. he also said there were deep concerns whether bondholders ought to be able to be paid back in full under any debt restructuring plans that would be overseen by a newly created oversight board at a time when social services are being cut on the island.  lawmakers are trying to enact a bill to prevent further economic and social chaos in puerto rico, where the government faces a july 1 debt payment of $1.9 billion. the island, a territory of the united states, has a total debt of roughly $70 billion. the republican chairman of the house natural resources committee is hoping his panel votes by wednesday to approve a puerto rico debt bill he negotiated with leading house democrats and the obama administration and send the measure to the full house for debate and passage. durbin told reporters he heard strong opposition to the house bill during a meeting in chicago on monday with puerto rican community leaders. durbin spoke following a weekly closed meeting of democrats in which the puerto rico legislation was discussed. “there wasn’t a single person (speaking) in support” of the bill during that meeting, he said.

" the u.s. intelligence community will soon disclose an estimate of the number of americans whose electronic communications have been caught in the crosshairs of online surveillance programs intended for foreigners, u.s. lawmakers said in a letter seen by reuters on friday. the estimate, requested by members of the u.s. house of representatives judiciary committee, is expected to be made public as early as next month, the letter said. its disclosure would come as congress is expected to begin debate in the coming months over whether to reauthorize or reform the so called surveillance authority, known as section 702, a provision that was added to the foreign intelligence surveillance act in 2008. “the timely production of this information is incredibly important to informed debate on section 702 in the next congress— and, without it, even those of us inclined to support reauthorization would have reason for concern,” said the letter signed by 11 lawmakers, all members of the house judiciary committee. the letter was sent on friday to national intelligence director james clapper. it said his office and national security agency (nsa) officials had already briefed congressional staff about how the intelligence community intends to comply with the disclosure request. clapper’s office confirmed the letter had been received but declined further comment. the lawmakers termed their letter an effort to “memorialize our understanding” of the intelligence community’s plan to provide an estimate in real numbers, not percentages, as soon as january that can be shared with the public. the government has long held that calculating the number of americans subject to section 702 surveillance might be technically impossible and would require privacy intrusions exceeding those raised by the actual surveillance programs, which were originally intended to counter foreign espionage. intelligence officials have said that online data about americans is “incidentally” collected under section 702, due to a range of technical and practical reasons. critics have assailed such collection as back door surveillance of americans without a warrant. section 702 will expire on dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action. it enables two internet surveillance programs called prism and upstream that were revealed in a series of leaks by former nsa contractor edward snowden more than three years ago. prism gathers messaging data from alphabet inc’s google, facebook , microsoft, apple  and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. upstream allows the nsa to copy web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the united states and search that data for certain terms associated with a target. clapper, who is stepping down next month, suggested in april that providing an estimate of americans surveilled under section 702, a figure some have said could tally in the millions, might be possible, while defending the law as “a prolific producer of critical intelligence.” republicans james sensenbrenner, darrell issa, ted poe and jason chaffetz signed the letter, in addition to democrats john conyers, jerrold nadler, zoe lofgren, hank johnson, ted deutch, suzan delbene and david cicilline.

" security forces in the southern yemeni city of aden arrested 10 members of an islamist partner in the internationally recognized government, the islah party said on wednesday. aden is dominated by local forces backed by the united arab emirates, a key member of the saudi led coalition that intervened in yemen s civil war in 2015 to restore president abd rabbu mansour hadi to power but is hostile toward islamists. the arrests could raise tension within the coalition fighting the iran aligned houthi movement and forces loyal to ex president ali abdullah saleh who seized much of northern yemen, including the capital sanaa, and drove hadi into exile. islah said security forces raided the home of its number two man in aden, mohammed abdel malek, and arrested him, along with a member of the party s local shura council as well as a local militia commander. security forces also closed down the party s office in the al qaloua district of aden, islah said in a statement. a security source in aden confirmed four people were arrested and said the move was related to the assassination of a salafist imam in aden on tuesday by a bomb planted in his car. while both in the islamist camp, salafists and islah are at odds as some of the former back a secession of south yemen while the latter wants the arabian peninsula state to remain intact. it was unclear if the arrested islah members had been formally charged.  (islah) directs a call to public opinion, the government and the coalition demanding they shoulder their responsibility to swiftly release brother abdel malek and his colleagues and to stop these arbitrary measures,  islah s statement said. with thousands of fighters deployed on battlefronts against the houthis, islah has been an important ally of hadi and the saudi led coalition trying to reinstate his government. but islah, seen as linked with the muslim brotherhood, has come under pressure since a rift erupted between qatar and some arab states, including the uae and saudi arabia, in june over allegations qatar backs islamist militants. qatar denies this. since the coalition intervened in yemen, islah has tried to distance itself from the brotherhood in an effort to ease gulf rulers  anxiety about its islamist ideology.  the brotherhood denies accusations from conservative arab governments of involvement in terrorism, saying it seeks change only by peaceful means.

" humanitarian crises around the world will worsen next year with no let up in african civil wars, near famines in conflict ridden regions and the threat of islamist violence, a geneva based think tank predicted in a report published on thursday. the report by acaps, a non profit venture that supports humanitarian aid workers with daily monitoring and analysis of 150 countries, examined the anticipated needs of 18 countries in 2018 and found little to cheer.  if 2017 did not look good, predictions for 2018 are no better: violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in afghanistan, democratic republic of congo, libya, ethiopia, mali, somalia, and syria next year,  acaps director lars peter nissen wrote in the report. next year ethiopia will join northeastern nigeria, somalia, south sudan and yemen as places at risk of famine, said the report, entitled ""humanitarian overview: an analysis of key crises into 2018"". here in a separate report, the u.s. funded famine early warning systems network said an estimated 76 million people across 45 countries were likely to need food aid in 2018, driven by conflict, an 18 month old drought in the horn of africa and forecasts for below average rains in africa s spring next year.  rather than bringing stability, the prospect of elections in afghanistan, iraq, libya, south sudan and venezuela is expected to exacerbate tensions and fuel violence, the acaps report said.  islamic extremism will also continue to cause death and conflict, the report said. despite the defeat of islamic state in its main strongholds in iraq, the group is expected to continue improvised attacks throughout the country to destabilise the government, as well as gaining strength and resources in southern libya. islamic state is also likely to increase its toehold in the puntland region of somalia, impacting the civilian population and clashing with its bigger regional rival al shabaab, which will increase the lethality of its own attacks. acaps said islamist armed groups are also expected to take advantage of the withdrawal of government troops from central mali, gaining local recruits and further influence, while in afghanistan the taliban will consolidate rural strongholds and increased opium production will boost funding for armed groups. the fragmentation of armed groups in central african republic is expected to worsen the violence there, sending more refugees into cameroon and democratic republic of congo, where president joseph kabila is unlikely to leave power until 2019, fuelling frustration and violent protest, the report said.  militia groups previously focused on local grievances will likely become increasingly frustrated by the national, political, and socioeconomic situation and are likely to increase violence, particularly against government forces and institutions,  the report said.

" british police made a new arrest on monday in their investigation into a bomb attack on a london underground train earlier this month. the man, 20, was detained at a house in the welsh capital cardiff by counter terrorism officers, london police said. he is the seventh man to have been arrested over the attack at parsons green station in london on sept. 15 which injured 30 people. it was britain s fifth major militant attack so far this year. last friday, teenager ahmed hassan appeared in court charged with attempting to murder passengers on board the train heading to central london from the southwest suburb of wimbledon and causing an explosion likely to endanger life using the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide (tatp)   known as  the mother of satan    or another explosive substance. the 18 year old, from sunbury on thames, a town to the southwest of london, was remanded in custody until oct. 13. the home made bomb engulfed a carriage in flames, but apparently failed to fully explode.  two other men are still being questioned by police while three others have since been released by detectives and face no further action. searches are still ongoing at one address in surrey, south of london, and in cardiff.

" ten republican state attorneys general on thursday urged federal authorities to rescind a policy set by former u.s. president barack obama that protects from deportation nearly 600,000 immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents, known as “dreamers.” obama, a democrat, had hoped that overhauling the u.s. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy. but republican president donald trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. the department of homeland security earlier this month rescinded a separate obama era policy meant to cover illegal immigrant parents that had been blocked by the courts. however, dhs said the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, policy covering “dreamers” was still in effect. in a letter on thursday, the republican attorneys general asked that dhs abolish the daca program going forward, while noting that the government did not have to rescind permits that had already been issued.  if the federal government does not withdraw daca, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in federal court in texas. a dhs representative referred questions to the u.s. department of justice, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the 10 republican attorneys general who signed the letter represent the states of texas, louisiana, alabama, nebraska, arkansas, south carolina, idaho, tennessee, west virginia and kansas.  a larger coalition of 26 republican ags had challenged the policy covering illegal immigrant parents.  in a statement, the mexican american legal defense and educational fund said it took encouragement from the diminished number of attorneys general signing onto the daca letter, and urged trump not to “cave in to the toothless threat” of legal action.

" the u.s. senate on thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically modified ingredients, which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some u.s. crops. the senate voted 63 30 for the bill that would display gmo contents with words, pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones. the u.s. agriculture department (usda) would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified. the measure now goes to the house of representatives, where it is expected to pass. drawing praise from farmers, the bill sponsored by republican senator pat roberts of kansas and democrat senator debbie stabenow of michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws, including vermont’s that some say is more stringent, and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency. “this bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the united states will have access, for the first time ever, to information about their food through a mandatory, nationwide label for food products with gmos,” stabenow said in a statement. a nationwide standard is favored by the food industry, which says state by state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution. but mandatory gmo labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for big food, which has spent millions lobbying against it. farmers lobbied against the vermont law, worrying that labeling stigmatizes gmo crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients, but have applauded this law.     critics like senator bernie sanders, an independent from vermont, say the bill’s vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion. “when parents go to the store and purchase food, they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating,” sanders said on the floor of the senate ahead of the vote. he said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with gmo ingredients to meet the new law in his home state. another opponent of the bill, democratic senator jeff merkley of oregon, said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about gmos. food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil, which can be derived from genetically engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed, may not fall under the law’s definition of a bioengineered food, critics say. gmo corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language, some said. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) raised concerns about the involvement of the usda in a list of worries sent in a june 27 memo to the senate agriculture committee. in a letter to stabenow last week, the usda’s general counsel tried to quell those worries, saying it would include commercially grown gmo corn, soybeans, sugar and canola crops. the vast majority of corn, soybeans and sugar crops in the united states are produced from genetically engineered seeds. the domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non gmo ingredients like cane sugar. the united states is the world’s largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. “it’s fair to say that it’s not the ideal bill, but it is certainly the bill that can pass, which is the most important right now,” said american soybean association’s (asa) director of policy communications patrick delaney. the association was part of the coalition for safe and affordable food, which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the deny americans the right to know, or dark act, that would have made labeling voluntary. it was blocked by the senate in march.

" kenya s election board must give access to election returns to parties challenging president uhuru kenyatta s victory in last month s presidential election, the supreme court ruled on wednesday.  access to the original vote tally forms and a copy of the voter register must immediately be granted to the petitioners, a former lawmaker and two human rights activists, the judges said. they denied a request for access to the electronic devices used in vote counting. the legal challenges come after the court nullified kenyatta s august victory and ordered a new election, an unprecedented move in africa. the current proceedings may be the last chance for legal scrutiny of the second election, held on oct. 26. the protracted political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of the east african nation, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security. the court is on a tight schedule. it has until nov. 20 to rule on the two petitions. if the election result is upheld, kenyatta will be sworn in on nov. 28. chief justice david maraga told the petitioners they must file a report on their findings from the returns by thursday afternoon.  after wednesday s ruling, lawyers for the petitioners began presenting their cases, arguing the poll s outcome is void because the election board did not hold fresh nominations after the earlier poll was invalidated, among other reasons.   our position is you cannot have a fresh presidential election without a fresh round of nominations,  said benjamin musyoki, a lawyer for former legislator harun mwau. the lawyer for the two activists, julie soweto, also argued that voter turnout   just 39 percent, because opposition leader raila odinga boycotted the election   required the court to consider whether the election conformed  to the spirit and intent of the constitution.  violence before and during the election also marred the process, soweto said. she also referred to remarks by the election board chair the week before polling   he said he could not guarantee the vote would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues [l8n1mt0xk]. the process in the supreme court, however, may not repair the rifts opened by this year s prolonged elections season. a poll released by research firm ipsos found that 80 percent of kenyans think the country is going in the wrong direction. pessimism about the country s path was at a record high   higher than during drought and food shortages earlier this year or a prolonged teachers  strike in 2015.  human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in election violence, mostly at the hands of police cracking down  on opposition supporters. electioneering has also disrupted east africa s richest economy. the government lowered its forecast for 2017 economic growth to 5.5 percent, partly because of the  political uncertainty.  the supreme court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a violent political crisis three years earlier. around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes after a disputed election in 2007. however, analysts said the moves by kenya s court may  embolden other judiciaries in africa. this month, liberia s supreme court halted a presidential run off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting.

" u.s. senator marco rubio of florida said on wednesday he is  considering running for re election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help republicans retain their majority in the u.s. senate.  “i’ll go home later this week. and i’ll have some time with my family. and then, if there’s a change in our status, i’ll be sure to let everyone know,” the former republican presidential candidate told reporters in the u.s. capitol.  rubio, 45, first elected to the senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the senate in march after losing florida’s presidential primary. but senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only republican who can win the election in florida.  rubio confirmed a politico report that he was urged to run for re election on sunday in orlando, florida, by one of the republicans contending for the seat, his friend lieutenant governor carlos lopez cantera. the two men were in orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. another florida republican hopeful, u.s. representative david jolly, has indicated he would step aside if rubio entered the race. rubio must decide whether to seek re election by june 24, the filing deadline for florida’s august primary.

" the u.s. government may become a movie and music industry player, at least temporarily, after moving to seize $1 billion in assets that prosecutors said were bought with money looted from the malaysian state development fund.  the 2013 movie “the wolf of wall street” and an interest in the rights of emi music publishing are among the targets of civil lawsuits that are filled with allegations that malaysian officials, their relatives and associates laundered the fund’s money and hid it in property, artwork and luxury goods in the united states. seizures of assets by government authorities are fairly common, but they more typically involve sports cars, yachts and jewelry bought with drug trafficking proceeds or with profits from white collar crime. the case of the malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1mdb announced on wednesday is unusually large and involves some out of the ordinary assets, such as rights associated with the dark comedy film starring leonardo dicaprio as a corrupt new york stockbroker. the film could make another $100 million in the near future, a box office analyst said. according to the lawsuits, a malaysian national involved in creating 1mdb, low taek jho, used about $10 million from 1mdb to invest in the film and separately used about $107 million to buy “a substantial interest” in emi, the world’s third largest music publishing company by revenue.  low did not respond to requests for comment sent to his hong kong based company, jynwel capital. u.s. government seized assets are usually sold off at auction to raise money for victims. until that can happen, u.s. authorities must maintain the assets, officials said. the u.s. marshals service manages and auctions seized assets. if a judge approves the seizure of 1mdb linked assets, the usual process would be followed, justice department spokesman peter carr said. the assets would be initially restrained so their owners could not sell or transfer them. any profits generated would be held in escrow until the case was resolved, carr said. “we would sell those interests and, if possible and appropriate, use the proceeds of those sales for the benefit of the victim citizens in malaysia,” carr said in an email.  in the 1990s, the government owned shares in a california casino and through a trustee helped to manage it, putting washington for a short time in the gambling business. a marshals service spokeswoman said she did not immediately know if the agency had previously auctioned film and music royalty rights. the agency had 17,564 assets on hand as of september 2015, valued at $3.1 billion, its website said. court papers filed by the justice department would, if approved by a judge, grant sweeping powers to the marshals service to manage the 1mdb linked assets. under a proposed restraining order, red granite pictures, which produced “the wolf of wall street,” would have to maintain present contracts related to the film and “allow the united states to join in and direct key business decisions about day to day operations.” in a statement, red granite said that to its knowledge, none of the money it received was illegitimate and that co founder riza aziz and the company did nothing wrong. aziz is the stepson of malaysian prime minister najib razak, who oversaw the 1mdb fund. the justice department lawsuits said that high level officials of 1mdb corruptly diverted more than $3.5 billion from the fund over six years.

" u.s. president donald trump’s rollback on his predecessor’s liberalization of travel to cuba will all but eliminate a burgeoning market for independent tourism, forcing would be visitors into organized trips, experts said. that policy change could be bad news for airlines that have been helped by demand from solo travelers and families who have booked seats for ad hoc informal “cultural exchanges” that had passed muster under former president barack obama’s loosened rules.  “it’s going to frustrate airlines who scheduled service on the premise that travel restrictions would eventually be removed,” robert mann, analyst at r.w. mann & co, said. “it was an ‘if you build it they will come’ kind of a philosophy.” now, under directives announced by trump on friday, independent travel to cuba from the united states will once again be forbidden, complicating the already tricky to navigate industry.  the new policy will ban most u.s. business transactions with the armed forces business enterprises group, a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel and hospitality industry, but make some exceptions, including air and sea travel. [nl1n1jd02o] the president’s directive will essentially shield u.s. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island but dim a potentially bright outlook for travel growth between the countries.  while the industry at large is bracing for weakened demand following the policy shift, specialized travel agents could potentially see a windfall as travelers rush to book authorized organized trips to the island. “you can’t get through to our call line. we’re receiving 10 times the emails we were this morning,” tom popper, president of travel agency insightcuba, which organizes legal group tours of the tourism restricted island, said on friday. u.s. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, washington lobby group engage cuba said in a recent report. (tmsnrt.rs/2rbfmti) while trump’s new policy avoids the worst case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on cuba as a new high growth market.   “if the goal is to help cuban entrepreneurs, adding job killing regulations on u.s. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer,” james williams, president of engage cuba, said in a statement.     marriott international inc on friday urged the white house to improve relations with post castro cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain, operates the gaviota 5th avenue hotel, which is owned by the cuban military. the treasury department said on its website that travel related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the office of foreign assets control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the marriott venture. airlines for america, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and “will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to cuba.” obama’s initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into cuba in mid 2016. some early entrants, including smaller carriers frontier airlines, silver airways and spirit airlines inc, have pulled out. while larger u.s. carriers have pared back flights to smaller cuban cities, american airlines, delta, united continental, southwest and jetblue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to havana.  cruise operator carnival corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was “pleased” its ships could continue to sail to cuba.

" canada, fearful of talk by the u.s. presidential candidates to  reopen the north american free trade agreement, could use the opportunity to push for a better deal on worker mobility, dispute resolutions and other issues, canadian negotiators of the original pact said. republican donald trump calls nafta the worst trade deal signed by the united states and democrat hillary clinton has signaled a change of position on the 1994 pact she supported when it became law under her husband, former president bill clinton. the agreement between the united states, canada and mexico is often used for political grist in u.s. election campaigns but altering it is a major concern for export oriented canada. in 2008, barack obama campaigned on renegotiating the treaty with tougher labor and environmental standards, a pledge that fell to the wayside when he became president in january 2009. but the idea has taken hold more strongly in 2016 and mexico has said it is ready to update the treaty. canada has said nafta is in the best interest of all three countries. if canada were forced to renegotiate, one issue it could target is the pact’s investor state dispute settlement provision. the united states wanted it included in the original deal to protect u.s. investments in mexico. it has since been used by american companies to sue canadian federal and provincial governments. transcanada corp is using the provision to seek billions from the u.s. government for rejecting the keystone xl pipeline. that would probably be an area of mutual concern for canada and the united states given those unintended consequences, said derek burney, canada’s former u.s. ambassador, who was involved in the original negotiations. labor mobility, a concern for canadian technology companies, could be improved by updating the list of professions that allows workers to relocate between countries. “we fell short in terms of what we wanted to achieve on labor mobility in the nafta,” said john weekes, canada’s chief negotiator, who added canada should also push for improved access to the u.s. government procurement market. reopening nafta could give the canadian government cover to phase out a domestic supply management system for the politically powerful dairy industry that has come under international criticism, negotiators said. “i’d be secretly delighted if they came hard at us on supply management,” said burney. “given the dairy industry and its weight in the united states, it’s not easy to dismiss.” the system controls dairy prices and production, which critics say drives up consumers prices. the industry says it allows farmers to get stable prices, and noted canada has preserved the system while negotiating several trade agreements. still, former negotiators warned canada would not be working from a position of strength as it sought concessions. “ignoring everything else, yes, there could be an opportunity there,” said michael hart, who advised on the original negotiations. “but in the real world, i’d be very cautious.” while clinton has said she would rework the trade pact, trump’s threat to withdraw is a bigger concern in canada. “if we’re in a situation where people are threatening they’re going to walk out of trade agreements unless they can be renegotiated, then i think we’re in a situation where it would be very difficult,” said weekes.

" european union lawmakers have raised concerns over money laundering in malta and the independence of its police and judiciary in a draft resolution, stepping up pressure on the island after the assassination of an investigative journalist. daphne caruana galizia, who had denounced high profile corruption and accused prime minister joseph muscat of wrongdoing, was killed on oct. 16 by a bomb that tore through her car.  an investigation is under way and muscat has promised that everything will be done to find the killers. next week the eu parliament will vote on a resolution on the rule of law in malta. in a draft text, seen by reuters, the parliament said it  regrets that developments in malta in recent years have led to serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media and the independence of the police and judiciary . it said that  the independence of law enforcement and the judiciary in malta may be compromised by the fact that the government is empowered to appoint the police commissioner, the head of the fiau (anti money laundering agency) and the attorney general . the resolution called on the european commission to oversee more closely respect for the rule of law in malta and regretted the eu executive s decision not to publish its anti corruption report this year. at a news conference on friday, the largest group in the parliament, the conservative european people s party (epp), called on the eu commission to  urgently  step up its monitoring of malta.  we think there are serious questions regarding the freedom of media and the lack of law enforcement in malta,  said daniel koster, an epp spokesman. he said the epp had doubts about what the commission was doing to address this situation. the calls from the conservatives were echoed by the liberal, leftist and green groupings in the assembly. reports from the maltese anti money laundering agency were leaked in june via caruana galizia s blog. they raised concerns about pilatus bank, a maltese lender accused of having failed to report suspicious dealings as required by law. the eu lawmakers  draft resolution calls on malta to investigate pilatus bank. the bank and the maltese police did not reply to reuters  questions on the allegations.  there appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach,  of money laundering rules in malta, an eu commission official told reuters in reply to questions over the island s application of eu rules on money laundering. the draft resolution, citing findings of the parliament s inquiry committee on money laundering, said maltese institutions in charge of enforcing rules to prevent financial crimes were  highly politicized .  the number of convictions and confiscations related to money laundering in malta seems extremely low,  it said.

" al shabaab fighters killed at least 15 soldiers in an attack on a military base near somalia s capital, mogadishu, the militant group and somali officials said on friday. the militants used guns and car bombs to take control of the base and a nearby town, barire, 50 km (30 miles) southwest of mogadishu, in an early morning attack. the fighters also took 11 pickup trucks mounted with machine guns, known as  technicals , said abdiasis abu musab, al shabaab s military operation spokesman.  the other soldiers ran helter skelter into the woods. we now control the base and the village,  he said. a somali military officer put the number of dead at 15; al shabaab said 21 were killed. the government and al shabaab often give differing accounts of death tolls.  there was a battalion of soldiers but it was a fierce fighting; twin suicide car bombs and hand to hand fighting,  captain osman ali told reuters.  the attacked soldiers were somali military and the special  forces trained by the u.s. called danab. there were neither amisom nor other foreigners there,  ali added, referring to african union peacekeeping troops. reinforcements were being sent, he said.  al shabaab aims to topple the government in mogadishu and impose its own strict interpretation of islam. somalia has been at war since 1991, when clan based warlords overthrew dictator siad barre and then turned on each other. the al qaeda linked group was driven out of the capital in 2011, but it still carries out frequent attacks on security and government targets and african union peacekeeping troops. civilians sometimes get caught in the crossfire.  ali nur, the deputy governor of lower shabelle region where barire is situated, confirmed the fighting. so did local residents.  first we heard two huge blasts at the base and then heavy exchange of gunfire followed. now it looks like the fighting died down,  ali farah told reuters from barire village. two weeks ago, al shabaab attacked an army base at a town near the border with kenya. three weeks ago they struck another in the southern port city of kismayu, killing a total of at least 43 people in the two attacks.

" some republican lawmakers appear to be reassessing whether to make changes to a surveillance law that allows broad snooping of internet communications, citing concerns over the handling of classified intercepts after leaks of conversations between russian officials and american associates of president donald trump. the law, known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, allows u.s. intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of communications from foreigners, but often incidentally scoops up the communications of americans. until recently most republicans have been quick to defend section 702 and congress had been expected to renew it without major changes before it expires at the end of the year. though long criticized by privacy advocates, a new front of potential opposition to section 702 has emerged as republicans sputter about what they view as politically motivated leaks by the agencies amid probes of any collusion between the russian government and trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign.  the tensions burst into full view on monday at a u.s. house of representatives’ intelligence committee hearing, during which fbi director james comey confirmed his agency was investigating those ties.  republican representative tom rooney told comey and national security agency director mike rogers, who also testified, that concern over leaks would undermine support for section 702, even though it appears to not have led directly to the leaks republicans are fuming over. “when we try to retain this tool this year and try to convince some of our colleagues that this is really important for national security and somebody in the intelligence community says, ‘you know what, the hell with it, i’m going to release this person’s name because i’m going to get something out of it,’ we’re all going to be hurt by that,” rooney said as he removed his glasses in apparent exasperation. while democrats on the committee focused their questioning of comey and rogers on whether trump aides may have suspicious ties to russian officials, republicans repeatedly redirected the conversation to focus on whether enough safeguards were in place to prevent leaks about americans. u.s. intelligence agencies accused moscow of attempts to influence the election in favor of republican trump, in part by hacking emails of democratic party operatives. russia denies the allegations. trump has criticized the intelligence agencies and has denied he has had anything to do with russia. section 702 surveillance is intended to apply only to foreigners living overseas. elaborate rules govern incidental coverage of americans, but the information can sometimes be used  nonetheless. privacy advocates have said that communications belonging to as many as tens of millions of americans could be caught up in the searches. despite the concern about leaks, a white house official told reuters earlier this month that the trump administration favored a reauthorization this year of the expiring portions of the fisa without any changes to address privacy concerns. on monday, several republicans sought to directly link media reports revealing that trump’s former national security advisor, michael flynn, exchanged calls during the presidential transition with russian ambassador sergei kislyak about sanctions to the debate about section 702.  flynn had told vice president mike pence he did not speak to kislyak about sanctions, an assertion contradicted by news articles, which cited transcripts of surveillance intercepts and led to flynn’s ouster. comey and rogers both said that section 702 surveillance was unrelated to how intercepts of flynn’s calls were collected or leaked to the press, and that such information would have most likely been gathered under a different part of fisa or a wholly separate authority. “that is a distinction that doesn’t make a difference to people watching on television,” representative trey gowdy responded, adding that renewal of section 702 was “in jeopardy if we don’t get this resolved.” the hearing echoed conversations that took place during a closed meeting with senior intelligence officials this month with the house judiciary committee, which is expected to take the lead on writing legislation that will seek reform and renewal of section 702.  two sources familiar with the meeting said several lawmakers sought clarity on how many intelligence officials had access to classified surveillance information but were frustrated by the lack of clear answers. rogers said monday that 20 people at nsa, including himself, possessed the authority to “unmask” americans whose communications are ensnared via foreign intelligence programs. a select few officials at other agencies also have the authority, including some at the federal bureau of investigation, the department of justice and the cia. section 702 enables sweeping surveillance programs known as prism and upstream, which were revealed publicly in 2013 by former nsa contractor edward snowden. prism gathers messaging data from alphabet inc’s google , facebook inc , microsoft corp, apple inc and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. upstream allows the nsa to copy web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the united states and search that data.

" low gas prices and president barack obama’s high approval ratings are key factors that favor democrat hillary clinton winning the white house in next week’s election, according to a model from moody’s analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine u.s. presidential contests. clinton is forecast to pick up 332 electoral college votes against 206 for republican donald trump, moody’s analytics predicted on tuesday in the final update of its model before election day on nov. 8. that would match obama’s margin of victory over republican challenger mitt romney in 2012. the reuters ipsos states of the nation project also predicts a clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. a candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. the moody’s analytics model is based on a combination of state level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since republican ronald reagan unseated democrat jimmy carter in 1980. rather than focus on the individual candidates in a race, the model instead centers on whether current economic and political conditions favor the incumbent party in the white house. this year those factors point to clinton becoming the 45th u.s. president. the economic factors moody’s measures include the two year percentage changes in real personal income per household, as well as house and gasoline prices.  among the political factors weighed, moody’s said the most important is the share of the vote in any one state that went to the incumbent party in the previous election. it also takes into account voter fatigue and the incumbent president’s approval ratings. this year, with obama enjoying some of his highest job approval ratings since his first year in office in 2009 and gasoline prices holding steady at well below average levels, the model suggests the democrats will win their third straight presidential election, moody’s said. that would mark the first time since the 1988 election of republican george h.w. bush that one party has won three consecutive presidential contests. moody’s warns, however, that its model does not take into account any individual characteristics of specific candidates. “given the unusual nature of the 2016 election cycle to date, it is very possible that voters will react to changing economic and political conditions differently than they have in past election cycles, placing some risk in the model outcome, particularly state by state projections,” moody’s analytics economist dan white wrote in the report.

" iran  seriously condemns  the u.s. decision to move its embassy to jerusalem and its recognition of the city as israel s capital, read a statement on wednesday from the ministry of foreign affairs carried by state media. the move violates international resolutions, the statement said. supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said earlier that the united states was trying to destabilize the region and start a war to protect israel s security. the u.s. action will  incite muslims and inflame a new intifada and encourage extremism and violent behavior for which the responsibility will lie with (the united states) and the zionist regime (israel),  the foreign ministry statement said. the statement also called on the international community to pressure the united states not to go through with the embassy move or the recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital.  the islamic republic of iran has reiterated that the most important reason for the falling apart of stability and security in the middle east is the continued occupation and the biased and unequivocal support of the american government for the zionist regime,  the statement said.  and the deprivation of the oppressed palestinian people from their primary rights in forming an independent palestinian government with the noble quds as its capital,  it said, using the arabic name for jerusalem.

" donald trump has taken a more than 20 point lead over u.s. senator ted cruz of texas in the republican race for the presidential nomination, bolstering his position ahead of the party’s primary in south carolina on saturday, according to a national reuters/ipsos poll. among republicans, trump, a billionaire businessman, drew 40 percent support in the poll conducted from saturday to wednesday, compared with 17 percent for cruz, 11 percent for u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon ben carson, and 8 percent for former florida governor jeb bush. the results contrasted with those of a national poll conducted this week by nbc news and the wall street journal that showed trump dropping into a national dead heat with cruz in the race for the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. on the democratic side, the reuters/ipsos poll showed former secretary of state hillary clinton maintaining about a 10 point national lead over u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont since last week’s new hampshire primary won by sanders. the republican results marked a nominal gain for trump since his win in the feb. 9 new hampshire primary, when he led cruz by 18.4 points in the national rolling survey, although the increase remained within the poll’s credibility interval. since he announced his candidacy last summer, trump has leveraged his celebrity and deep pockets to wage an unfiltered campaign that has upended the republican primary. he has led the reuters/ipsos daily tracking poll since nearly the start of his campaign, topping bush in late july. the reuters/ipsos poll also showed that either clinton or sanders would win a hypothetical general election contest with trump. clinton would likely win with 44 percent support,  compared with 37 percent for trump. sanders would likely win by 44 percent to 35 percent. the poll included responses from 476 registered republicans and 543 registered democrats. it had a credibility interval of about 5 percent.

" president elect donald trump named the head of exxon mobil corp, rex tillerson, as his choice for u.s. secretary of state on tuesday and won backing from some republican foreign policy figures ahead of a possible senate fight over the oilman’s ties to russia. the exxon chief executive potentially faces difficulties getting confirmed in the republican controlled senate. some lawmakers worry about his links to moscow and opposition to u.s. sanctions on russia, which awarded him a friendship medal in 2013.     but several republican establishment figures, including former secretaries of state james baker and condoleezza rice, and former defense secretary robert gates vouched for tillerson, 64, who has spent more than 40 years at the oil company.  rice and gates, who have worked for exxon as consultants, both issued statements of support on tuesday.      their backing could be crucial for tillerson receiving the approval he needs in the senate, where republicans will have a slim majority when trump takes office on jan 20.     “the fact that condi rice, james baker and bob gates are recommending tillerson carries considerable weight,” said republican senator jeff flake, a member of the senate foreign relations committee. by choosing tillerson, trump adds another person to his cabinet and circle of advisers who may favor a soft line toward moscow, which is under u.s. sanctions for its 2014 annexation of crimea and at the center of allegations that it launched cyber attacks to disrupt the u.s. presidential election.  republican foreign policy hawks in the senate like john mccain and lindsey graham are likely to give tillerson a rough time at a confirmation hearing in early january. “it’s very well known that he has a very close relationship with (russian president) vladimir putin,” said mccain, the republican party’s 2008 nominee for president.   republicans will have a majority of just 52 48 in the senate, and only a few defections from their ranks would block tillerson if every democrat also opposed him.     trump, on a victory tour of states that backed him in the november election, told supporters in west allis, wisconsin, that tillerson “will be a fierce advocate for american interests around the world.” he called him “a strong man, a tough man.” trump upset u.s. allies during his campaign by calling for a better relationship with russia and questioning the usefulness of the north atlantic treaty organization, the u.s. led military bloc created after world war two to counter the soviet union.  trump has also pledged to confront china on trade and territorial issues and temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states, angering many islamic countries. tillerson has foreign experience from years of cutting deals with foreign countries for his company, the world’s largest energy firm. in 2012, tillerson signed a deal with russian state oil giant rosneft to jointly develop oil fields in western siberia. he has been chief executive of exxon mobil since 2006     but like trump he has never held public office. tillerson said in a statement that he shared the president elect’s “vision for restoring the credibility of the united states.” exxon mobil said its board would meet soon regarding its transition. trump was also poised to add another figure with close ties to the oil industry to his cabinet. a source close to the transition said trump had chosen former texas governor rick perry, whose state is a leading oil producer, as his nominee for energy secretary, with an announcement expected soon.  perry met trump at trump tower in new york on monday, part of a series of meetings that included rapper kanye west on tuesday. trump also has offered the position of interior secretary to montana first term representative ryan zinke, an ex navy seal commander who was an early trump supporter, according to media reports. trump appointed stephen miller, a top policy aide during the campaign, to be his senior adviser for policy. miller had been an adviser to u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom trump has nominated to be attorney general. in 2013, putin bestowed a russian state honor, the order of friendship, on tillerson, citing his work “strengthening cooperation in the energy sector.” there also has been controversy over alleged russian interference in the nov. 8 presidential election, with the cia concluding that moscow had intervened to help trump defeat democrat hillary clinton. tillerson’s “cozy ties to vladimir putin and russia would represent an untenable conflict at the state department,” representative eliot engel, the ranking democrat on the house of representatives committee on foreign affairs, said in a statement. russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said trump and tillerson were “pragmatic people” who could help america and russia build a mutually beneficial relationship.   a group of u.s. state attorneys general is investigating exxon for allegedly misleading the public about climate change and some environmental groups are alarmed exxon’s ceo could be america’s top diplomat. exxon has said it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years. tillerson told a congressional hearing in 2010 he thought humanity contributed to climate change but the science was unclear about the size of the contribution. “it is extremely complicated,” he told the hearing. after trump’s election, exxon came out in support of the paris climate agreement to combat climate change.        there also are concerns among lawmakers about former u.n. ambassador john bolton, who an adviser to trump’s transition team said was still under consideration for the deputy secretary of state role.     bolton has urged washington to do more to counter china’s assertiveness in east asia.

" barely two days into crafting a new bill to roll back obamacare, u.s. senate republicans were already on the defensive on tuesday over the absence of any women in their core working group. after a meeting of the senate healthcare group, lawmakers were bombarded with questions as to why no women were named to the 13 man panel. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell tried to explain. “the working group that counts is all 52 of us,” mcconnell told reporters, referring to all 52 republican senators in the 100 member chamber. “nobody is being excluded based upon gender ... everybody’s at the table. everybody.” democrats pounced. republican men are negotiating “a secret healthcare plan, which i really hope is not happening in the men’s locker room,” said senator patty murray, a member of the democratic leadership from washington state.      if the criticism was any sign of what lies ahead as senators try to improve on a rollback bill passed on thursday by house of representatives republicans, it could be a long road ahead. dismantling the parts of president barack obama’s signature healthcare law that they dislike and preserving other parts of it is proving to be a difficult task for president donald trump and his fellow republicans. a house of representatives’ plan for doing that, approved last week amid much drama, faces an uncertain future in the senate. some republicans eye drafting a similar senate bill by mid summer, possibly with the involvement of democrats. others indicate the house bill requires major surgery and that the effort to replace the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, could take months.  regardless of timing, two decisive factors will come into sharper focus soon. one is voter reaction to the house bill, now being voiced in town hall events being hosted nationwide by house members in their home districts. the other factor is an expected analysis by the non partisan congressional budget office of how many million americans would lose their health insurance coverage under the house bill, if it became law, and how it would affect the u.s. budget deficit. both the cbo analysis and the town hall events have the potential to do damage to the house legislation, which trump hailed as a triumph just days ago. senators are already talking about major changes in the house bill concerning medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and tax subsidies for healthcare coverage. trying to get past the controversy over the absence of women on the healthcare panel, senate republicans said they expected to devote much time to healthcare in the near future.  “i don’t think we’re going to be talking about much else other than healthcare at least three days a week with all members of our conference present,” said senator john cornyn, the no. 2 republican. cornyn said senators would start with the house bill. “if we have to make modifications in order to pass it, we’ll make those modifications and work out the differences with the house.” medicaid was the topic at the senate working group meeting  tuesday. the house bill would cut federal spending on medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. but some republicans want any reductions to be more gradual, and trump made a campaign pledge not to cut the program. “there ought to be a glide path where you do not have a cliff that the house provides in 2020,” when the expansion of medicaid under obamacare is abruptly ended, said senator rob portman of ohio. but other republicans said cutbacks were important to save taxpayer money. “the public wants every dime you can give them. let’s face it, once you get them on the dole, they are going to take every dime they can. we’ve got to find some way of getting things under control, or this country and your future’s going to be gone,” said republican senator orrin hatch, a member of the healthcare working group.

" the powerful head of moldova s ruling party vlad plahotniuc on thursday accused russian authorities of harassing him and other officials with dozens of bogus legal cases, ratcheting up a long running diplomatic row between the two countries. plahotniuc was charged in absentia by russian investigators this week of orchestrating the attempted murder of a banker in london in 2012, according to russian media outlets.  without referring to any particular case, plahotniuc told reuters that russian officials had sought to frame him to put him on international law enforcement watch lists. plahotniuc expects further retaliation after the moldovan parliament on thursday passed a law to prevent the dissemination of foreign  fake news,  on russian language and other channels. russian security services are  falsely accusing us of ethnic, political and ideological hatred, murder, theft, virtually anything they could think of,  he said by email through a representative.   they have seen their attempts failing so far, thus, they already went on with tougher and more explicit abuses.  the russian foreign ministry and general prosecutor s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. maria zakharova, the russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, at a briefing in november accused the moldovan government and lawmakers of  some openly anti russian actions  and hampering attempts by moldova s president to foster closer ties.  nevertheless, russia is open to long term development of friendly, partner relations with a neutral moldova, relations based on long standing historical ties between our peoples,  she said.   ex soviet moldova is politically divided between a pro western government, which favors closer integration with the european union, and russian backed president igor dodon.  moldova and russia have been embroiled in a series of spats this year.  the chisinau government in march accused russia s security apparatus of seeking to derail a moldovan probe into a russian led money laundering operation by harassing moldovan officials as they traveled to or through russia. plahotniuc said that behavior continued in recent months because of ongoing investigations into the case known locally as the  russian laundromat .   russia s behavior  toward my colleagues and me is an explicit act of blackmail and political harassment.. abusive and illegal behavior, which will not change our commitment to the democratic and european development of moldova,  he said.  the moldovan parliament adopted a bill on thursday aimed at combating foreign propaganda, banning television channels from airing news and analytical programs from countries that have not signed up a european broadcasting agreement, such as russia.  nobody is banning any channels from any particular country. this is not a question of banning channels from broadcasting, but about banning specific programs whose purpose is manipulation, propaganda and disinformation,  the author of the bill, mp serdjiu sirbu, told parliament. dodon said he would refuse to sign the bill into law.   under no circumstances will i sign a bill limiting the broadcasting of russian tv channels in the republic. this document contradicts all the european norms of freedom of speech, as well as the constitution of moldova,  he said.

" protesters threw rocks and bottles at police officers who responded with pepper spray outside a rally for presidential candidate donald trump in albuquerque, new mexico, police said.     hundreds of protesters tried to storm the convention center in new mexico’s biggest city, knocking down barricades and throwing objects at a door and then hurling rocks and bottles at mounted police in riot gear, the albuquerque police department said on twitter on tuesday and video posted online showed.  several police officers were injured, the police tweeted.  protesters chanted anti trump slogans, held anti trump signs and waved mexican flags before the demonstration descended into chaos with some protesters standing on top of police cars.   television footage showed officers responding by using pepper spray and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd. police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where protesters continually interrupted trump’s speech.  no one at the police department was immediately available for comment. protests have become common outside rallies for trump, the party’s presumptive nominee, who has polarized opinion with his rhetoric against illegal immigration. he abandoned a rally in chicago in march after clashes between his supporters and protesters. he has accused mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the u.s. border and has promised to build a wall and make mexico pay for it. according to cnn, his supporters chanted “build that wall” during his rally on tuesday in albuquerque where a little less than half of the population is hispanic or latino.     “watching thugs (and) punks in albuquerque   en route to california. they don’t even know what they are protesting,” trump aide dan scavino said on twitter.  trump heads on wednesday to a rally in anaheim, california, which has a growing latino minority.

" los angeles mayor eric garcetti appeared within striking distance to clinch re election as leader of america’s second largest city on tuesday against 10 lesser known challengers, most of them lacking significant financial support. garcetti, 46, a former city council member and urban planning expert seeking his second term as mayor, needs to win at least 50 percent of the vote plus one in order to avoid a may run off race with the second place finisher. a recent loyola marymount university poll found garcetti backed by 50.1 percent of registered voters, compared with 7.9 percent for his closest rival, mitchell schwartz, a political operative of former president barack obama during his first white house campaign. but the telephone and online survey of 950 people, conducted in january and early february, showed 38.5 percent were still undecided. the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus just over three percentage points. schwartz, 55, has seized on the city’s rising crime rate and soaring housing costs, while warning of a looming pension fund crisis, in his bid to unseat garcetti. the mayor has touted his successful support for a measure to raise the minimum wage in los angeles and pointed to the city’s employment gains in the aftermath of a nationwide recession. garcetti enjoys a significant funding advantage, reporting his campaign has amassed more than $3.8 million as of march 1, while schwartz, the only other candidate to have raised substantial cash, is expected to have spent $790,000, a spokesman said. schwartz was previously best known as the california state director of obama’s presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008. before that he served as director of communications at the state department during president bill clinton’s first term in office. garcetti, who defeated then city controller wendy greuel in a run off four years ago, is the son of former prosecutor gil garcetti, whose office tried o.j. simpson for murder, and lost, while serving as los angeles county district attorney. drawing almost as much attention, and far more money, in tuesday’s municipal elections was the highly contested ballot measure s, aimed at limiting development by halting “spot zoning” amendments to the city’s general plan for two years. measure s supporters say spot zoning permits granted to wealthy real estate interests have spurred runaway construction of high rise office space and other costly developments that increase congestion and drive up housing costs. opponents say the measure would go too far and actually undermine city efforts to create more affordable housing.

" former u.s. presidents george w. bush and bill clinton told a forum in dallas on thursday that they were able to forge mutual bonds of respect and friendship because the other had been gracious in victory and respectful of presidential power. the two did not mention president donald trump once during a nearly hour long discussion where they traded quips and insights. but they offered indirect references that many in the crowd of about 300 people at the george w. bush presidential library took to be references to the current president. “he (clinton) was humble in victory, which is very important in dealing with other people,” bush said at the event to mark a graduation at the presidential leadership scholars program, a partnership among the bush, clinton, lyndon johnson and george h.w. bush presidential centers. clinton said: “if you want to be president, realize it’s about the people, not about you.  “you want to be able to say ‘things were better off when i quit, kid’s had a better future, things were coming together.’ you don’t want to say, ‘god, look at all the people i beat.’” current president trump has come under criticism from democrats who have said he fires off excessive and unwarranted criticism against his predecessor, democratic president barack obama and the person he beat in the election, democrat hillary clinton. republican bush said while in office he sought democrat clinton’s advice. clinton said when he left office he told incoming president bush that he would offer him help and treat him with respect. bush and clinton said they have enjoyed their lives after the presidency but would not trade their current status for their eight years in office.  “the decisions you make have a monumental effect on people,” bush said, adding humility is a key quality for any president. “presidency is often defined by the unexpected. it makes the job interesting,” he said. clinton said: “if you don’t deal with the incoming fire, it will undermine your ability to do anything else. if all you deal with is incoming fire, you can’t keep the promises you made when you were running.” the two also exchanged jokes about being grandfathers, with bush saying his grandchildren call him “jefe,” spanish for “chief.” “the best thing that can happen to you when you are in politics is to be consistently underestimated,” clinton said. “i was pretty good at that,” bush returned.

"liberal logic 101 the new superintendent for detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the detroit free press. we have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  superintendent nikolai vitti told the free press.hechinger report   since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in detroit public schools  enrollment: 73 percent. this has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. however, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. during that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. in addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.fortherecord says: two charter schools authorized by detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the mackinac center for public policy. the report card examined michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.detroit s martin luther king jr. education center academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. ross/hill academy was the second-best.ironically, detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country. in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the national assessment of education progress did assessments and detroit was rated as the worst in each time.washington examiner   according to a highly regarded study, in just one year michigan charter school students earn an additional two months of learning gains over their traditional public school counterparts. for detroit, charter students get an additional three months of learning in math and reading when compared to their traditional school peers.most michigan charter schools are authorized by state universities, and most conventional public school districts do not authorize any charters. detroit is an exception, having authorized 14 charters.  michigan capitol confidential",1

" the united states and germany called on china to immediately release a prominent human rights activist who was jailed for eight years on tuesday for subversion, the harshest sentence passed in a recent crackdown on activism. wu gan, a blogger better known by his online name  super vulgar butcher , regularly championed sensitive cases of government abuses of power, both online and in street protests. he was detained in may 2015 and charged with subversion. in a separate case, also on tuesday, rights lawyer xie yang avoided criminal punishment despite being found guilty of inciting subversion, because he admitted to his crimes.  we call on the chinese authorities to release wu immediately,  the u.s. and germany embassies in china said in a joint statement.  as xie has been exempted from punishment, we urge china to allow xie to resume his professional activities without preconditions and be free of any restrictions.  china s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but beijing frequently denounces foreign concern about rights cases as an interference in internal affairs and says china is a country with rule of law. wu, in a statement released by his lawyers late on tuesday, said he considered the sentence an  honor  as it proved that he had not become a  slave  or  accomplice  to the china s  autocracy .  i got eight years, but i feel no grief or despair. this was my choice, because opposing autocracy means you are already on the road to jail,  wu said in the statement.  i call on the international community to pay attention to china s deteriorating human rights situation,  he added. wu s sentence was the most severe in what rights groups have called an unprecedented attack on rights activists and lawyers, known as the 709 crackdown, which began in full force on july 9, 2015. the hardline approach has shown no sign of softening as president xi jinping enters his second five year term in office, and has drawn widespread concern in western capitals. germany has been particularly outspoken, to china s irritation. speaking at a daily news briefing on wednesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying expressed displeasure at comments last week by the german ambassador on china s failure to set up a previously agreed upon cyber consultation mechanism. china had, in fact, invited germany to send representatives to talks, but the germans kept putting china off, hua told reporters. china hoped the ambassador stops saying such  irresponsible remarks , she added.

" pope francis canonized 35 new roman catholic saints on sunday, including three indigenous children martyred in 16th century mexico and considered the first christians killed for their faith in the new world. francis used the occasion to announce that he had decided to call a meeting of bishops, or synod, from countries in the    pan amazon region for october, 2019, to discuss the condition of the church in the area and the plight of indigenous people. the region includes guyana, suriname, french guyana, venezuela, ecuador, colombia, bolivia, peru and brazil. the three children the pope canonized before a crowd of tens of thousands in st. peter s square were of the talaxcaltec people, an indigenous pre colombian group in what is now mexico. the first child, cristoforo, was converted to christianity by franciscan missionaries and was killed in 1527 by his own father, a tribal chief who spurned his son s attempts to convert him from paganism. the boy was beaten and thrown into a fire when he was 13. two other indigenous children from the same area, antonio and juan, were killed by indios in the village of cuauhtinchan in 1529 as a result of their conversion. they are believed to have been 12 or 13 when they were beaten to death for helping dominican missionaries. the pope also canonized 30 martyrs who were killed for their faith in brazil in 1645. they included two portuguese missionaries and 28 followers killed by dutch colonial soldiers during a period of persecution of catholics. in announcing the 2019 synod for bishops from the amazon region, francis said indigenous people there today were  often abandoned and without the prospect of a bright future, even due to the crisis of the amazon forest, a lung of utmost importance for our planet . francis, an argentine and the first latin american pope, has often linked his calls for social justice, particularly for indigenous people, to those for defense of the environment, saying the poor will suffer the most from the effects of climate change. in 2015 he wrote a landmark encyclical, or papal letter, on defense of the environment and he has called for special protection for the amazon region because of its vital importance to the planet s ecosystem. in his comments on sunday, the pope did not mention the role of the church in suppressing native cultures in the new world. but during a visit to bolivia in 2015, francis said  many grave sins were committed against the native people of america in the name of god . he asked forgiveness for the church, for  crimes committed against native peoples during the so called conquest of america . on sunday, francis also canonized father faustino miguez, a spanish priest who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, and father angelo d acri, an italian itinerant preacher who died in 1739 after serving in some of the most remote areas of mountainous southern italy.

" the united states on tuesday declined to name china as a currency manipulator although it remained critical of the chinese government’s economic policies ahead of a planned visit to beijing by president donald trump. the semi annual u.s. treasury currency report said no countries deserved the currency manipulator label, but it kept china on a currency “monitoring list” despite a fall in china’s global current account surplus since 2016. china’s currency, the renminbi or yuan, also has strengthened sharply against the dollar this year, reversing three straight years of weakening. the treasury cited china’s unusually large, bilateral trade surplus with the united states.  “treasury remains concerned by the lack of progress made in reducing the bilateral trade surplus,” the department said in the report. “china continues to pursue a wide array of policies that limit market access for imported goods and services.” the u.s. china trade deficit stood at $34.9 billion in august, near a two year high. four other trading partners which were on the monitoring list in april   japan, south korea, germany and switzerland   remained on the list. the administration said it was removing taiwan from the list because it had reduced the scale of its foreign exchange interventions. deputy governor ching long yang said taiwan’s central bank will continue the currency dialogue with washington. south korea’s finance ministry official in charge of currency markets said washington’s decision was as expected, noting the shrinking trade surplus with the united states helped his country avoid the “currency manipulator” label. “currency markets should be market oriented, and we conduct smoothing operations only in cases of sharp volatility,” kim yoon kyung, director general at the ministry’s international finance bureau, told reuters by phone. trump, who on the campaign trail blamed china for “stealing” u.s. jobs and prosperity by cheapening its currency, had repeatedly promised to label the country as a currency manipulator on “day one” of a trump administration   a move that would trigger special negotiations and could lead to punitive duties and other action. but the president’s comments on china have been less harsh since he took office in january. trump has said he would like beijing’s help in pressuring north korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program, and plans to meet chinese president xi jinping on a trip to beijing in november. currency market analysts by and large had not expected the trump administration to take a hard line on the currency issue now in the context of the north korea tensions. “there’s a necessity for the best possible cooperation we can get out of china on the north korea issue, and labeling them a currency manipulator is probably not the best way to go about that,” said joseph trevisani, chief market strategist at worldwide markets in woodcliff lake, new jersey.”in addition, there are very specific criteria at the treasury for labeling someone a currency manipulator and over the past year and a half china simply does not fit those categories.” as in its previous report on currencies in april, the treasury criticized china’s past efforts to hold down the yuan’s value. but it said more recent efforts by beijing to prevent a sudden depreciation of the yuan had probably helped the united states.  “a disorderly currency depreciation ... would have had negative consequences for the united states, china and the global economy,” the treasury said. in fact, after three years of depreciating against the dollar in which it weakened by more than 12 percent, the yuan this year has strengthened by nearly 5 percent. it was not yet trading following the report’s release but the offshore yuan was little changed against the dollar. the treasury did not alter its three major thresholds for identifying currency manipulation put in place last year by the obama administration: a bilateral trade surplus with the united states of $20 billion or more; a global current account surplus of at least 3 percent of gross domestic product, and persistent foreign exchange purchases equal to 2 percent of gdp over 12 months.  no countries were determined to have met all three of these criteria. treasury said a country would be put on the monitoring list if it met two of the criteria or if it accounted for a large and disproportionate share of the overall u.s. trade deficit. it also said countries put on the list would stay there for at least two consecutive currency reports “to help ensure that any improvement in performance versus the criteria is durable”.

" president donald trump’s personal attorney disputed key points of the testimony of former fbi director james comey on thursday and attacked comey for leaking information to the media. comey accused trump of firing him to try to undermine the federal bureau of investigation’s probe into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. comey said trump pressured him to drop an investigation of his former national security adviser michael flynn and told comey that he needed his loyalty even though fbi directors are supposed to work independently from the white house. trump did not directly comment on the allegations, but his personal attorney, marc kasowitz, tried to discredit comey’s testimony. “the president never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that mr. comey stop investigating anyone,” kasowitz said in a brief appearance before television cameras. “the president also never told mr. comey, ‘i need loyalty, i expect loyalty.’ he never said it in form and he never said it in substance.” kasowitz said comey’s testimony made it clear that trump was not being investigated for collusion with russian officials and that the president felt “completely vindicated.” the attorney also attacked comey for testifying that he used a friend to leak to a reporter his notes on a meeting with trump. kasowitz said the leak contained “privileged communications with the president.”  “we will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all the others that are being investigated,” kasowitz said. legal experts questioned kasowitz’s contention that trump’s private encounters with comey should be considered privileged communications.  comey said he had hoped the leak would prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which later occurred. kasowitz is playing a lead role in handling trump’s responses to the russia investigation. he was with trump at the white house on thursday to watch comey’s televised testimony.

" the threat of losing power to a fierce leftwing rival next year is tempting mexico s ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) to enlist outside help for the first time in its nine decade history. corruption scandals, sluggish growth, failure to curb gang violence and persistent allegations of electoral fraud have seriously eroded the centrist party s already rocky reputation ahead of the july 2018 presidential election. that has opened the door to andres manuel lopez obrador, a leftist former mayor of mexico city and twice runner up for the presidency who has set the early pace with a relentless campaign against government corruption. the pri s presidential hopefuls can begin registering on dec. 3 and many officials believe jose antonio meade, currently finance minister, will be chosen in a bid to detoxify its brand. a fixture in the cabinet across two rival administrations, meade has no formal party affiliation and has distinguished himself as a discreet and diplomatic public servant with a grasp of finance and economics matched by few in mexico. more importantly, he has avoided the damaging scandals that have engulfed the pri under president enrique pena nieto, who cannot seek a second six year term. heriberto galindo, a senior pri politician, said meade s probity and economic savvy make him an ideal choice at a time of nagging uncertainty for mexico due to u.s. president donald trump s threats to ditch the nafta trade deal.  the mexican public s main social concerns are corruption and impunity, and jose antonio meade has a reputation for being honorable and honest, and he is honorable and honest,  galindo said.  that s why i think he should be the candidate.  the pri said on thursday that the party s candidate would be elected by a national convention on feb. 18. by then, the candidate may be obvious. cross party appeal nearly a dozen pri lawmakers, serving or former government officials consulted by reuters said they believed meade would most likely be chosen, pointing to his cross party appeal. none forecast it would be the most prominent pri contender, interior minister miguel angel osorio chong, who has failed to tame gang violence and was pilloried for the 2015 jail break of kingpin joaquin  el chapo  guzman. meade has been coy about whether he wants the presidency, and some pri grandees caution the party might spring a surprise. education minister aurelio nuno, 39, pena nieto s former chief of staff and one of his closest allies, as well as health minister jose narro, are viewed as the most likely alternatives. speculation over meade intensified when the pri changed its statutes in august to make it easier for outsiders to run, but pena nieto has sought to dispel talk of the finance minister. polls show he would have work to do. meade is not widely recognized by the public, and one survey this week by polling firm buendia & laredo put him 14 percentage points behind lopez obrador in a match up with a third leading contender. however, pri officials supportive of meade believe he could persuade enough mexicans opposed to lopez obrador to cast a so called  voto util  (useful vote) and win. much of that calculus, they argue, rests on meade s ties to the center right national action party (pan), which ruled mexico from 2000 to 2012 and has fought bitterly with lopez obrador. entering government bureaucracy in the 1990s, meade was by 2011 minister for energy, and later that year, finance. many pan lawmakers speak warmly of him and say that if the 2018 race became a choice between lopez obrador and meade, they could back the latter. yet the fact the pri is considering somebody from outside its ranks shows the extent of the party s troubles, said ernesto cordero, a pan senator who preceded meade as finance minister. an october study by pollster mitofsky showed that while the pri slightly lagged the pan and lopez obrador s morena party in terms of active support   backed by about 18 percent of voters   it was easily the most unpopular, rejected by over half.  in strategic terms, the pri needs a candidate that can say his hands are clean,  cordero said. pena nieto made meade foreign minister in 2012 before he eventually returned to the finance ministry last year, making him, at 48, the most experienced cabinet member in government. expectations that the pri could soon pass the torch to meade were heightened on wednesday when pena nieto s top aide, foreign minister luis videgaray, described the yale educated economist in glowing terms at an event.  under the leadership of jose antonio meade, mexico today has a direction, stability and has clarity in its decision making on economic policy,  videgaray said. however, on thursday pena nieto attempted to knock down the impression videgaray s words had created.  don t be fooled,  he told reporters.  the pri doesn t choose its candidate on the basis of praise or applause.

" malian soldiers killed by a french military strike in northern mali last month were deserters who had joined an islamist militant group, a french source close to the matter said on tuesday. that contradicted comments from the malian defense ministry, which said on monday that the soldiers killed in the oct. 23 strike, a raid on a camp of the ansar dine militant group, had been its hostages. the french source said the raid was carried out  on the basis of detailed intelligence against a camp that included malians who had joined the islamist ranks. they were hit, amongst others.   they were not prisoners,  the source told reuters, declining to say how many were killed or captured in the raid. the source accused malian authorities of spreading propaganda in the run up to a presidential election scheduled for november 2018. a french defense ministry source added:  we have a real trust problem with the malians.  malian officials were not immediately available for comment. the french army said in a later statement that the head of its barkhane operation, general bruno guibert, had spoken with his malian counterpart on tuesday to update him on information it said showed the stricken camp was  unmistakably  used as a training camp for terrorists.  this research has at no point shown the presence on this site of malian soldiers, whether captured or hired by the terrorist group,  the statement said, adding that the french army was ready to help mali if it wanted to send to the site a mission to gather information. the french army previously said that 15 members of ansar dine, which is loosely affiliated to other militant groups operating in northern mali, were taken  out of action  in the raid. the malian government is struggling to contain tuareg and islamist violence in northern mali, some of which is spreading south. attempts to place officials in northern towns have sometimes failed, raising questions about the government s ability to maintain stability ahead of the election.  islamist militants seized northern mali in 2012 and french forces intervened a year later.  around 4,000 of its troops remain in west africa s sahel region as part of operation barkhane, a cross border anti terrorism operation. france has also been at the forefront of organizing a regional force as part of efforts to find a long term strategy to exit the region.

" togo must go the way of other west african nations and swiftly limit presidential terms to two if it wants to prevent protests escalating into a political crisis, the united nations envoy to the region said on saturday. thousands of people have taken to the streets in the past three days to demand that president faure gnassingbe step aside, in the most serious challenge to his family s 50 year ruling dynasty since the death of his father in 2005. police have responded with tear gas, although avoiding the bloodshed that has tarnished previous demonstrations, and internet and phone calls have been restricted. there were no further reports of protests on saturday, and they seemed to have died down, but the opposition said they would continue until gnassingbe steps aside.   it has become unavoidable for togo to join the rest of west africa in having term limitations,  u.n. special representative for west africa and the sahel mohamed ibn chambas told reuters in a telephone interview. since gambia s yahya jammeh was forced out after losing an election last december, all west african countries except togo have accepted two term limits on presidential office   bucking a regressive trend across africa to remove them and re enable  presidents for life .  our main perspective is to advise the togolese to take those actions to prevent an escalation,  he added.  we are in a region where the security challenges are real and menacing and so we don t want to see any deep political crisis.  he said a move by gnassingbe s government this week to propose a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two term limit was welcome. the opposition has rejected it because it says it would enable him to stay in power until 2030.  i suspect the devil is in the detail. we have to wait to see the formulation of the draft,  chambas said. an official in gnassingbe s cabinet did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but chambas said he had received assurances during his meeting with the president on friday that he had  heard the people . the president s father gnassingbe eyadema seized power in a 1967 coup and ruled for 38 years before his death. he brought in a two term limit in 1992, in response to protests, then scrapped it a decade later when he decided he wanted to run again. when he died in 2005, the military installed his son instead of the national assembly head, as was constitutionally mandated, stoking protests in which at least 500 people were killed.  faure gnassingbe has since sought to remodel togo as a shipping, banking and airline hub modeled on dubai or singapore, with some limited success in port upgrades, regional airline operator asky and pan african bank ecobank.  chambas urged the government to move swiftly with changes.  my biggest fear for it to go to the national assembly and there be a total blockage. i hope there will be a clear time line...not a perception that this is a delaying tactic,  he said.  that will go a long way toward building confidence.

" take the dregs left from making soy bean oil, which usually go to feed the pigs. press and roll them into a sandy colored paste. stuff with rice, and top with chilli sauce. the dish s name, injogogi, means  man made meat.  in north korea for years it was a recipe for survival. today it is a popular street food, traded alongside other goods and services on informal markets, known as jangmadang. defectors say there are hundreds of these markets. the creation and informal trade of injogogi and other foods offers a window into a barter economy that has kept north korea afloat despite years of isolation, abuse and sanctions.  back in the day, people had injogogi to fill themselves up as a substitute for meat,  said cho ui sung, a north korean who defected to the south in 2014.  now people eat it for its taste.  north korea was set up with backing from the soviet union as a socialist state. the soviet collapse in 1991 crippled the north korean economy and brought down its centralized food distribution system. as many as three million people died. those who survived were forced to forage, barter and invent meals from whatever they found. since people started to use their own initiative, studies indicate, person to person dealings have become the way millions of north koreans procure basic necessities such as food and clothing. but the prevalence of informal markets also makes it hard to understand the exact state of the north korean economy. and this makes it hard to measure how badly sanctions, which do not apply to north korean food imports, are hurting ordinary people. pyongyang has said the curbs threaten the survival of its children. defectors say a poor corn harvest this year has made it hard for people in rural areas to feed themselves. the agencies who want to help find all this hard to measure. pyongyang says 70 percent of north koreans still use the state s central distribution system as their main source of food, the same number of people that the u.n. estimates are  food insecure.  the system consistently provides lower food rations than the government s daily target, according to u.n. food agency the world food programme (wfp). the u.n. uses this information to call on member states to provide food aid for north korea   $76 million for  nutrition support  alone at its last request   of which it has received $42 million. but surveys and anecdotal evidence from defectors suggest private markets are the main source of supply for most north koreans.  it becomes sort of ridiculous to analyze food distribution in north korea by focusing on an archaic system that s lost so much of its significance over the past couple of decades,  said benjamin silberstein, an associate scholar at the foreign policy research institute who researches the north korean economy. the wfp and the u.n. s other main food aid agency, the food and agricultural organization, said the u.n. relies on all available information and inputs, including official statistics. the agencies have a permanent office in pyongyang and make regular visits to public distribution centers, farms and occasionally markets in north korea.  we recognize that the data and their sources are limited but it s the best we have available at present,  said the u.n. agencies in a joint statement, referring to the official north korean government data. the agencies said they have seen no sign that more food than needed is delivered to north koreans.  the main issue ... is a monotonous diet   mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste   lacking in essential fats and protein,  the statement said. the north korean diplomatic mission in geneva did not respond to questions about how international sanctions might be harming food availability and whether u.n. aid agencies had access to markets in north korea to assess the products on offer. last year, north korea s economy grew by 3.9 percent   its fastest in 17 years and faster than many developed economies, according to south korea s central bank. it was helped largely by mining, market reforms, and dealings with china, its neighbor and now the world s largest economy. reporters saw signs of chronic hunger in north korea as recently as 2013, but people who have defected say the food supply has improved in recent years.  eight defectors told reuters they ate much the same thing as people in the south. asked about the contents of their food cupboards, most said they were stocked with privately grown vegetables, locally made snacks and rice, or if they were poor, corn, which is a cheaper staple. younger and wealthier defectors say they had plenty of meat, although it was often seasonal because electric power is too erratic to power fridges. pork is common, but defectors also talked of eating dog meat, rabbit, and badger. even so, on average north koreans are less well nourished than their southern neighbors. the wfp says around one in four children have grown less tall than their south korean counterparts. a study from 2009 said pre school children in the north were up to 13 cm (5 inches) shorter and up to 7 kg (15 pounds) lighter than those brought up in the south. the north s public distribution system (pds) stipulates that 70 percent of people receive ration coupons to spend at state distribution shops. the other 30 percent are farmers who are not eligible for rations because they grow their own vegetables in private plots. according to the wfp, the pds had been reinstated by 2006. defectors say kim jong un, who came to power in 2011, also quietly loosened the rules on private trade. some markets, known as  grasshopper markets  for the speed with which traders set up and take down the stalls, are still illegal. but there are also officially sanctioned markets, where traders are free to buy and sell provided they pay stall fees to the state. inventions like injogogi are among foods traded on these stalls. it is low in calories but rich in protein and fiber, to help muscle growth and keep hunger at bay, said lee ae ran, a chef from the north korean town of hyesan who took a doctorate in nutrition in seoul.  because it contains so much protein, it s also very chewy,  lee said. the sauce can be delicious, said cho.  people who lived by the sea put shredded anchovies in the sauce; people living in the countryside used spicy peppers. i lived close by shore so i used shredded sand eels.  the jangmadang are remotely monitored by a website called daily nk, a seoul based operation staffed by north korean defector journalists. it said in a report released this august that there are 387 officially sanctioned markets in the country, encompassing more than half a million stalls. over 5 million people are either  directly or indirectly  reliant on the markets,  solidifying their place in north korean society as an integral and irreversible means of survival,  the report said. in 2015, a survey of 1,017 defectors by seoul university professor byung yeon kim found that official channels such as the pds accounted for just 23.5 percent of people s food intake. around 61 percent of respondents said private markets were their most important source of food, and the remaining 15.5 percent came from self cultivated crops. so the official system may mean little to many north koreans.  wfp has consistently been asking (the north korean government) to carry out a more detailed study on market activity and the role of markets in achieving household food security,  a spokeswoman said.  as in other countries, north korea s wealthy have choice. residents of the capital can order up a pizza in one of pyongyang s hundreds of restaurants, say regular visitors. many of the eateries are operated by state owned enterprises. some used to cater only to tourists. increasingly they now also collect dollars and euros from locals. at a place people know as the  italian on kwangbok street,  for example, moneyed locals and western tourists alike can pick vongole pasta for $3.50, or pepperoni pizzas for $10, the menu says. this compares with $0.30 for a kilo of corn or $0.50 for a portion of injogogi in the markets. reuters was unable to determine how the restaurant sources its ingredients such as pepperoni, although north korea imports processed meats and cheeses from european countries and southeast asia   such imports are legal. calls to the phone numbers on the menu failed and an operator for the pyongyang switchboard said the numbers could not be connected to international lines. as the economy in north korea has changed, so have the tastes of a moneyed middle class keen to try new foods. kim jong un has called for more domestically produced goods, according to state media, and there are more locally made sweets, snacks and candies. the country does not publish detailed import data but china s exports of sugar to north korea in january to september this year ballooned to 44,725 tonnes, chinese data shows. that is about half of all china s global sugar exports and compares with 1,236 tonnes in 2016 and 2,843 in 2015. north korea does not produce sugar. according to the international sugar organization, the north s sugar consumption is fairly steady at around 89,000 90,000 tonnes a year   a very modest amount per head. each south korean consumes about nine times more than that. at the other end of the social scale, chinese data shows corn exports to north korea also jumped in the first nine months of this year, to nearly 50,000 tonnes, compared with just over 3,000 tonnes in the whole of 2016. daily nk reporters say they call secret sources in north korea several times a week to get the market price of rice, corn, pork, fuels and the won currency   which is traded at around 8,100 to the dollar, as opposed to the official rate of around 100 to the dollar. so far, their reports suggest, petrol and diesel prices have doubled since the most recent round of u.n. security council resolutions. the market price of rice and corn has increased less sharply. reuters was not able to independently confirm their reports. and there are other ways north koreans can supplement their diets.  my dad often received bribes,  said one 28 year old defector who asked to be identified only by her surname, kang, because when she moved out in late 2010 she left her father behind. he

" a libyan coast guard vessel fired shots and boarded a humanitarian ship in the mediterranean on tuesday, demanding that the migrants on board be handed over to them, a spokesman for the mission lifeline charity said.  the libyan man said:  this is our territory,  said axel steier, a spokesman for the german based charity that performed its first rescues on tuesday.  after a while, they fired shots,  he said, probably into the air or sea. no one was wounded. afterward two libyans boarded the lifeline ship to try to persuade them to hand over some 70 migrants they had just taken off a wooden boat in international waters.   we told them we don t return migrants to libya. after a while, they gave up,  steier said. the two men spent about 15 minutes on board, he said. a libyan coast guard spokesman in tripoli declined to comment, saying he was seeking information. italy s coast guard, which coordinates rescues, did not respond to repeated telephone calls. it was the latest incident reported between the libyan coast guard and humanitarian rescue ships operating off north africa. financed, trained and equipped by italy, the tripoli based coastguard is intercepting a growing number of migrant boats. last month, the libyan coast guard ordered a spanish rescue vessel to sail to tripoli or risk being fired upon, though it later let it go. the worsening security situation has prompted several groups to halt rescue operations, and those who remain tend to patrol further from shore.     this year the libyan coast guard had stopped 16,567 people before they were rescued and taken to italy, according to the international organization for migration. but overall departures are down more than 20 percent and they dropped more than 80 percent in august after an armed group in sabratha clamped down on smuggling. italy is counting on the libyan coast guard together with the tripoli and municipal governments to put a halt to migrant arrivals from a country that has been torn by civil war and factional fighting since the ouster of muammar gaddafi in 2011.  the policy has been harshly criticized by humanitarian groups because of the dire conditions of libya s detention centers and the inhumane treatment of migrants in general in libya. despite recent declines in departures, almost 1,000 migrants were rescued on tuesday. save the children s vos hestia ship picked up some 750 people in six different rescues, a spokeswoman said, and the lifeline had more than 200 on board. sos mediterranee s aquarius ship picked up 20 libyans on monday.   there is no longer any work in libya and you risk being attacked,  a 26 year old libyan rescued told members of the sos crew.  it is impossible to live in libya, it has become too dangerous.

" republicans in the u.s. house of representatives forged ahead on tuesday with legislation to reshape the federal tax code, while a top credit ratings agency said the bill would balloon the budget deficit and give only a temporary boost to the economy. as the house tax committee weighed amendments to a bill that democrats have blasted as a give away to corporations and the rich, the washington tax reform debate was fast shifting to the senate, where republicans hold only a slim majority. senate republicans are expected to unveil their own tax bill at the end of the week, and early indications suggest it could differ significantly from the house legislation. the house is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior republican said. tax reform has been a priority for president donald trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth. but republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since trump took office in january, even though the party controls both chambers of congress as well as the white house. trump made another pitch for democratic support on capitol hill, where his top aides met with about a dozen senate democrats and trump himself phoned in from his asia trip. “he said, ‘look … i want to do it in a bipartisan way,’” senator joe donnelly told reporters.  fitch ratings predicted that a republican tax plan would win passage in both chambers, but did not see it offering long term benefits. “such reform would deliver a modest and temporary spur to growth. ... however, it will lead to wider fiscal deficits and add significantly to u.s. government debt,” fitch said, revising up its medium term u.s. government debt forecast. the u.s. national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. republicans once firmly opposed adding to the debt, but their emphasis has changed. congress’ joint committee on taxation (jct) said the house bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt from 2018 through 2027. trump and congressional republicans say the proposed tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to generate new revenues that would offset the tax cuts. few economists agree. the house bill slashes tax rates for large corporations, small businesses and wealthy americans, while sharply reducing or eliminating tax breaks that benefit many middle class americans such as deductions for state and local taxes, college tuition and home mortgage interest. jct estimates that the house bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. house republicans, who have an overwhelming majority, drafted their bill in secret, ignoring democrats.  but the house bill is unlikely to be taken up in the senate, where republicans have a 52 48 seat majority and they need to pay heed to moderates within their own ranks as well as democrats, lobbyists and analysts said. two conservative republican senators, ted cruz and rand paul, have already voiced concern that the house tax bill could raise taxes on some middle class americans.   the senate bill could delay the proposed corporate tax cut by one year, may not allow any deductions for local property taxes, and may not collapse the current seven individual brackets to the four proposed by the house, according to the washington post.  republican leaders have pushed for the house to vote on the tax bill before the u.s. thanksgiving holiday on nov. 23. “my donors are basically saying, get it done or don’t ever call me again,” republican representative chris collins said.         u.s. tax legislation must begin in the house. “we’ll bring it to the floor next week,” house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady told fox news. in party line votes on tuesday, brady’s tax committee voted down eight democratic amendments that would have preserved or expanded tax breaks for the middle class, nullified the tax legislation if it increased the deficit in future years and maintained taxes on foreign profits of u.s. corporations. brady offered a sweeping amendment on monday that tweaked at least half a dozen provisions of the 425 page bill.  one related to carried interest income, a share of an investment fund’s profits paid out to the fund’s general partners and which represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. carried interest currently is taxed at the capital gains rate, which is substantially lower than the personal income tax rate for higher earners. brady’s amendment would lengthen to more than three years from one the time period assets must be held in order to be eligible for the capital gains tax rate. the amendment would also reduce the amount of carried interest income eligible for the lower rate.

" britain s prince charles will tour southeast asia and india later this month, but the heir to the throne will not visit myanmar, after a spate of violence and allegations that authorities are carrying out ethnic cleansing. media reports last month said an official visit to myanmar was being suggested for the trip, which the prince is undertaking on behalf of the british government, and aides acknowledged it had been considered as part of the schedule. but it was omitted from the final program issued on wednesday. charles and his wife camilla will travel to singapore, malaysia and then to india where he will meet prime minister narendra modi.      we looked at a range of options in the region and, as we re announcing today, we re going ahead with the visit to singapore and malaysia,  philip malone, deputy head of department at britain s foreign and commonwealth office, told reporters. malone and royal aides declined to elaborate. more than 500,000 rohingya muslims have fled from myanmar to bangladesh in the past month since insurgents attacked security posts near the border, triggering fierce military retaliation that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing. last month britain suspended its training program for the military in myanmar because of the violence, and diplomatic relations have deteriorated. rights campaigners had argued against a royal visit.  to have someone of prince charles s stature go to visit the country would be seen as a reward, and giving legitimacy to the government and the military that are currently violating international law,  said mark farmaner, director of burma campaign uk. charles and camilla will begin their tour in singapore on oct. 31 before going to malaysia, where they will celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties since the former british colony became independent, before concluding the 11 day tour in india.

" california lawmakers voted to become a sanctuary state, tussled over hot button environmental issues and urged other states to refuse to cooperate with president donald trump’s election integrity commission as their legislative year ended early on saturday.   the majority democratic lawmakers headed back to their districts having positioned the state in opposition to conservative policies proposed by the republican dominated u.s. congress and president donald trump on immigration, the environment and other issues. “it’s a purposeful positioning,” said political analyst sherry bebitch jeffe, a senior fellow at the university of southern california. “we have a different political path and a different ideological path than the republican controlled congress and white house have.” this year, california lawmakers have strengthened protections for undocumented immigrants, increased the gasoline tax and extended a program aimed at compelling businesses to reduce air pollution, all in opposition to federal policies. early on saturday, lawmakers gave last minute support to a bill barring local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail just to allow enforcement officers to take them into their custody. the bill, a compromise from a version that sought to severely restrict interactions between law enforcement and immigration officials, does allow communities to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. it also allows enforcement agents access to local jails. it came a day after a federal judge barred the u.s. justice department from denying public safety grants to so called sanctuary cities in retaliation for limiting cooperation with the trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. the bill goes now to democratic governor jerry brown for his signature.  trump issued an executive order in january targeting funding for cities that offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. a san francisco judge blocked the order. illinois’ republican governor signed a bill last month protecting people from being detained because they are the subject of an immigration related warrant. although california lawmakers have enacted several environmental protections this year, a measure aimed at weaning the state’s power grid entirely off fossil fuels by 2045 died for the year after lawmakers adjourned without voting on it. california’s three investor owned utilities, pacific gas & electric (pcg_pa.a), southern california edison (sce_pe.a) and san diego gas & electric [sdge.ul], said the bill does not protect customers from the cost of switching from fossil fuels. assemblyman chris holden, who held the measure in his utilities and energy committee, said he would consider it again when the legislature returns in january for the second half of their two year session. the legislature also passed a package of bills aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing in the notoriously expensive state, and approved a plan for spending $1.5 billion in income from the state’s cap and trade air quality program, which raises money by selling businesses limited rights to emit pollutants. they passed a resolution condemning the election integrity commission, calling it an effort to suppress the voting rights of minorities and others, and voted to move up the state’s presidential primary from june to march.

" yemen s ex president ali abdullah saleh has had a successful operation at a sanaa hospital after a russian medical team was flown in to perform it, government sources said on saturday.  the russian team arrived in sanaa two days ago and operated on saleh on friday for wounds he sustained in an assassination attempt in 2011.  saleh s general people s congress party said the procedure was successful, and that his condition was stable.  saleh was severely wounded in an attack on the presidential palace in sanaa in june 2011. he went to the united states for treatment on one occasion, before a travel ban was imposed. the united nations security council imposed sanctions on saleh in 2014, accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing yemen s political process, subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze.  government sources told reuters the russian team had arrived with approval from the saudi led arab alliance but did not reveal the precise nature of the surgery.  saleh ruled yemen for 34 years, but was forced from power after pro democracy protests in 2012.  forming a surprise alliance with the houthi movement when they seized sanaa in 2014, saleh s army loyalists and houthi fighters have weathered thousands of air strikes by the saudi led military coalition in more than two years of war.

" appeals judges at the yugoslav war crimes tribunal upheld on wednesday the convictions of six bosnian croats found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1990s, in the court s last verdict before it closes next month. the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty), established by the united nations in 1993, is due to close when its mandate expires at the end of the year. the six former high level politicians and defense officials were convicted in 2013 of participating in an  ethnic cleansing  campaign against bosnian muslims.  they include jadranko prlic, a former defense minister, whose 25 year jail sentence was upheld on wednesday.  he had been found guilty of being part of a criminal enterprise by the wartime croatian government of late president franjo tudjman, to create an ethnically pure state. zagreb, which maintained it had  clean hands  in the bloody 1992 95 war in bosnia, had wanted that finding overturned.      however the appeals chamber concluded that it was not shown that the earlier judges had  misinterpreted relevant evidence  of tudjman and zagreb s confirmed croatia s role in the bosnian conflict. several convictions for specific crimes for prlic and the five others were reversed in the appeal, but president judge carmel agius said  all six remain convicted of numerous and very serious crimes.

" u.s. president barack obama called incoming philippines president rodrigo duterte on tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries’ alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the white house said. u.s. officials have signaled that washington is ready to work with duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. obama’s deputy national security adviser, ben rhodes, told a washington seminar earlier on tuesday that the u.s. administration was aware there was some “controversy” surrounding duterte and “statements that drew attention in the past,” but he did not elaborate. obama offered his congratulations to duterte as the “presumptive president elect.” he won the largest share of the votes in a may 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. obama “highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,” the white house said. washington hoped “to build on progress made with the last administration” in the philippines, rhodes said. “this is a new government and we’ll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,” he said when asked about the election, adding that washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. he has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of u.s. national security interests given china’s increasingly assertive stance in asia and maritime disputes in the south china sea. duterte’s vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. rhodes noted u.s. support for manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with china in the south china sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater u.s. military presence in the philippines.  “we believe that now as much as ever it’s important that the u.s. and philippines are seen working together,” he said. the u.s. stance on duterte could echo its approach toward india’s prime minister narendra modi. at one point, modi was unable to obtain a u.s. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the white house when he became prime minister.

" a democratic and a republican congressmen have asked the national security agency to halt a reported plan to share more raw intelligence data with other federal agencies, warning the policy shift would be “unconstitutional and dangerous,” according to a letter seen by reuters. u.s. representatives ted lieu and blake farenthold, who sit on the house oversight committee, said in a letter dated march 21 to nsa director michael rogers that the proposal would violate fourth amendment privacy protections because the collected data would not require a warrant before being searched for domestic law enforcement purposes. “if media accounts are true, this radical policy shift by the nsa would be unconstitutional, and dangerous,” lieu, a california democrat, and farenthold, a texas republican, wrote. the new york times reported last month that the proposal would allow the nsa to share intercepted private communications with other u.s. intelligence agencies before applying any privacy protections to the data.  bob litt, general counsel of the office of the director of national intelligence, told the times the obama administration was finalizing a 21 page draft of the new permissible procedures. the draft has not been made public. civil liberties advocates have interpreted the change as potentially allowing nsa foreign intelligence data, which sometimes can include collection of communications to, from or about americans, to be used for domestic policing purposes. the nsa has said its analysts scrub out certain personal information before handing any communications data over to other agencies. “our country has always drawn a line between our military and intelligence services, and domestic policing and spying,” the lawmakers wrote. “we do not — and should not — use u.s. army apache helicopters to quell domestic riots; navy seal teams to take down counterfeiting rings; or the nsa to conduct surveillance on domestic street gangs.” the executive branch is able to change its rules for some surveillance programs without congressional approval. without a law from congress, the government relies on executive order 12333, which was signed by president ronald reagan in 1981 and later modified by president george w. bush.  critics have said the order is overly broad and vague. the nsa did not respond to a request for comment about the letter. congress last year passed a law curtailing certain aspects of the nsa’s surveillance authority, most notably ending its bulk collection of domestic phone records exposed by former nsa contractor edward snowden in 2013.

" san diego attorney dulce garcia has regularly defended clients in immigration court. now, she is the one seeking legal relief.  brought to the united states illegally by her parents as a child, garcia is one of six immigrants who sued the trump administration on monday over its decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, program. since it was authorized in 2012 by president barack obama, the program has provided protection from deportation and the right to work legally to nearly 800,000 young people.  garcia’s case, filed in san francisco federal court, is the first to be brought by daca recipients, known as dreamers, since u.s. attorney general jeff sessions announced earlier this month that the obama era policy would start winding down in march 2018, according to garcia’s lawyers.   it is among several lawsuits challenging the decision to end daca, including two cases brought by state attorneys general. the legal claims in all of the cases, including garcia’s, are similar: that the trump administration did not follow proper administrative procedure in rescinding daca, and that making enforcement promises to a group of people, only to revoke them, violates due process.  the trump administration has said it is ending daca because obama overstepped his constitutional authority when he bypassed congress and created the daca program unilaterally. president donald trump called on congress to enact a law to protect daca recipients and last week angered some of his fellow republicans by negotiating with top congressional democratic leaders on possible legislation. during the 2016 presidential election trump ran on a hardline immigration platform, promising to end daca and strengthen border protections in order to increase jobs for u.s. workers.  the daughter of a hotel housekeeper and a welder, garcia arrived in southern california from mexico at the age of 4. a few years later, she said, her family was ousted from their apartment because the property contained illegal units. “we were living out of my dad’s truck for a little bit there,” she said. garcia decided to become an attorney after working for a criminal defense lawyer in high school. she put herself through school working for lawyers and performing other jobs such as parking cars. after obama announced daca in 2012, garcia, now 34, seized the opportunity. when she filled out forms for a social security number in 2013, the government clerk congratulated her. “i cried right there,” she said. the case on behalf of garcia and other daca recipients could be heard with two separately filed san francisco daca cases, one brought by the university of california and the other by a group of state attorneys general, led by california’s xavier becerra. another group of attorneys general, led by new york’s eric schneiderman, filed a lawsuit over daca on september 6 in brooklyn federal court.  legal experts have said court challenges to trump’s decision could face an uphill battle because a president typically has wide authority in implementing immigration policy. jirayut “new” latthivongskorn, another plaintiff in the lawsuit on monday, was brought to the united states from thailand when he was nine. latthivongskorn is now a fourth year medical student at university of california san francisco and a master’s degree candidate in public health at harvard. his daca work authorization expires in january 2019.  his medical residency is not set to begin until a few months after that, and could be impossible if he loses his authorization to work legally. “i have all these big ideas about how i want to change the world and change systems around health care,” he said. “the fact i might not be able to get there is troubling and frustrating.” garcia said that having to advise some of her daca clients that there may be no help for them while at the same time trying to address her own immigration status takes a toll.  “that’s a reason why i don’t do exclusively immigration law,” she said. “it would wear me down too fast.”",0
" israel shot down a syrian spy drone over the golan heights on saturday, the israeli military said. the drone was downed with a patriot interceptor missile over the golan demilitarized zone that has separated israeli and syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war. the military initially told reuters the uav was russian manufactured but offered no evidence. a military source later said it was unclear whether the uav was indeed russian made.   it was a reconnaissance uav (unmanned aerial vehicle) and not an attack uav and we are checking whether there is any connection to iran and hezbollah,  military spokesman, lieutenant colonel jonathan conricus, told reuters.  israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman said israel viewed the incident gravely and would respond to any provocation.   we hold the syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,  lieberman said in a statement. russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of syrian president bashar al assad in 2015, joining a de facto alliance with iranian forces, lebanese hezbollah and other shi ite muslim militias helping damascus beat back islamic state and other sunni muslim insurgent groups. israel fears an eventual assad victory could leave iran with a permanent garrison in syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring lebanon by the iranian backed hezbollah and has been lobbying russia and the united states for reassurances that iranian and hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within syria.   we will not allow the shi ite axis to establish syria as its forefront base,  lieberman said. the golan, which israel captured from syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the syrian civil war. israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross border attacks and has struck suspected hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in syria during the civil war. for its part, russia has set up a military hotline to prevent warplanes or anti aircraft units clashing accidentally over syria.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   transgender people would be allowed to use public restrooms in north carolina that match their gender identity under a settlement agreement filed on wednesday that aims to resolve the federal lawsuit over the state’s widely criticized bathroom law. the consent decree proposed by governor roy cooper, the american civil liberties union and transgender people who sued the state would remove some of the law’s harmful effects, civil rights groups said. the judge in the case must sign off on the proposal before it takes effect. north carolina has been mired in litigation about transgender rights since republican lawmakers enacted a law in 2016 that restricted bathroom choice in state run buildings to the sex on people’s birth certificates rather than their gender identity. a measure passed in march rescinded the so called bathroom bill known as hb 2 and helped bring back some business and sports events pulled from the state in protest. but activists said transgender people still faced discrimination under the new law, which left state lawmakers in control of bathroom policies. the consent decree says that under current state law, transgender people are not prevented from using their preferred public facilities. “for too many reasons, it is not in our state’s best interest to remain in drawn out court battles that still linger because of hb 2,” cooper, a democrat, said in a statement. republican legislative leaders, who intervened in the court dispute, were not part of the agreement. they had no immediate comment. cooper on wednesday also signed an executive order that bars state agencies and those who have contracts with the state from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or expression. activists were pleased by both actions but said they would continue to fight for full nondiscrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the state. “nothing can make up for the cruel and senseless attacks transgender people have faced in north carolina, but i am hopeful that the court will agree to clarify the law so that we can live our lives in less fear,” said joaquín carcaño, a transgender man and the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. tami fitzgerald, executive director of nc values coalition, which supported hb 2’s bathroom restrictions, criticized the consent decree and executive order. the “actions today constitute a massive power grab, with sweeping changes that only the legislative branch has the authority to enact,” she said in a statement.

" from planes, radars and ships in the baltics, nato officials say they are watching russia s biggest war games since 2013 with  calm and confidence , but many are unnerved about what they see as moscow testing its ability to wage war against the west. nato believes the exercises, officially starting on thursday in belarus, the baltic sea, western russia and the russian exclave of kaliningrad, are already underway. it says they are larger than moscow has publicized, numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear capable ballistic missiles. codenamed zapad or  west , nato officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the u.s. led alliance intended to show russia s ability to mass large numbers of troops at very short notice in the event of a conflict.  nato remains calm and vigilant,  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said last week during a visit to an estonian army base where british troops have been stationed since march. but lithuania s defense minister raimundas karoblis was less sanguine, voicing widely felt fears that the drills risk triggering an accidental conflict or could allow moscow to leave troops in neighboring belarus.  we can t be totally calm. there is a large foreign army massed next to lithuanian territory,  he told reuters. some western officials including the head of the u.s. army in europe, gen. ben hodges, have raised concerns that russia might use the drills as a  trojan horse  to make incursions into poland and russian speaking regions in the baltics. the kremlin firmly rejects any such plans. russia says some 13,000 troops from russia and belarus will be involved in the sept. 14 20 drills, below an international threshold that requires large numbers of outside observers. nato will send three experts to so called  visitor days  during the exercises, but a nato official said these were no substitute for meeting internationally agreed norms at such exercises that include talking to soldiers and briefings. moscow says it is the west that threatens stability in eastern europe because the u.s. led nato alliance has put a 4,000 strong multinational force in the baltics and poland. wrong footed by moscow in the recent past, with russia s seizure of crimea in 2014 and its intervention in syria s war in 2015, nato is distrustful of the kremlin s public message. in crimea, moscow proved a master of  hybrid warfare , with its mix of cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and use of russian and local forces without insignia.  one senior european security official said zapad would merge manoeuvres across russia s four western military districts in a  complex, multi dimensional aggressive, anti nato exercise .  it is all smoke and mirrors,  the official said, adding that the soviet era zapad exercises that were revived in 1999 had included simulated nuclear strikes on europe. nato officials say they have been watching russia s preparations for months, including the use of hundreds of rail cars to carry tanks and other heavy equipment into belarus. as a precaution, the u.s. army has moved 600 paratroopers to the baltics during zapad and has taken over guardianship of the airspace of lithuania, latvia and estonia, which lack capable air forces and air defense systems.  russia s military show of force raises some uncomfortable questions for the alliance because nato cannot yet mass large numbers of troops quickly, despite the united states  military might, nato officials and diplomats said. nato, a 29 nation defense pact created in 1949 to deter the soviet threat, has already begun its biggest modernization since the cold war, sending four battalions to the baltics and poland, setting up an agile, high readiness spearhead force, and developing its cyberspace defenses. but nato has deliberately taken a slowly slowly approach to its military build up to avoid being sucked into a new arms race, even as russia has stationed anti aircraft and anti ship missiles in kaliningrad, the black sea and syria.  the last thing we want is a military escalation with russia,  said one senior nato official involved in military planning, referring to zapad.  in the event of any potential russian incursion into the baltics or poland, nato s new multinational forces would quickly need large reinforcements. but a 40,000 strong force agreed in 2015 is still being developed, officials say. lithuania s karoblis said he hoped to see progress by the next summit of nato leaders in july 2018. baltic politicians want more discretion given to nato to fight any aggressor in the event of an attack, without waiting for the go ahead from allied governments.  during zapad, nato is taking a low key approach by running few exercises, including an annual sniper exercise in lithuania. only non nato member sweden is holding a large scale drill.     nato deputy supreme allied commander europe james everard told reuters there was no need to mirror zapad.  it s not a competition,  he said during a visit to nato forces in latvia.

" two months after the dominant military force in eastern libya declared victory in a campaign to retake benghazi, hassan al zawy is living rough in his home in the district that witnessed the city s last major battle. like many other residents, he ventured back as khalifa haftar s libyan national army gradually wrested back control from islamist militants and other rebel groups. parts of libya s second city were reduced to rubble during more than three years of fighting and, with economic crisis and political turmoil gripping the country, rebuilding is a daunting challenge.  there are flies, mosquitoes and garbage. at night, we have absolutely nothing,  zawy told reuters in mid august in the seafront neighborhood of sabri.  we ve been here for one month and 10 days and all we want from the state is (this): electricity and water, and for people to return to their homes, and stay there.  a conflict that developed after strongman muammar gaddafi was toppled in an uprising six years ago has yet to be resolved. benghazi, where the 2011 revolution started, has seen some of the worst violence. tens of thousands of residents, many opposed to haftar, were displaced to other libyan cities. sabri is where haftar s rivals had their final strongholds, and was bombarded by lna heavy artillery and air strikes up until a few weeks ago. sporadic fighting continued after haftar announced victory on july 5.. people recover what they can from the rubble of ruined buildings. children help with the cleanup.  afterwards, men sit outside drinking tea or coffee and guarding their streets. one says he will stay in his home even if he has to hang towels over the doors and windows.  another sabri resident, farag mahmoud, said some people were so keen to get back to their homes that they were ignoring the risk from land mines still planted in parts of the district.   we found our homes had been flooded from broken pipes in the plumbing systems, and were submerged in water around 70 to 80 centimeters deep,  he said. some returning residents have formed citizens  committees to lobby the municipal authorities on water, electricity and hygiene, said milad fadlallah, a local engineer. most residents in the less severely damaged eastern part of sabri would be able to spend the muslim holiday of eid al adha, which starts on sept. 1, back in their neighborhood, fadlallah said. but a lack of funds and political leadership in a country still divided between two rival governments will hinder reconstruction, said osama al kaza, director of projects at benghazi s municipality. in benghazi, the conflict has also had left deep physical and psychological scars.  achieving an outstanding and modern image for the city will have to be done in stages, will take years and cost billions,  he said.

" president donald trump will sign an order on tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the united states, administration officials said on sunday. under trump, the u.s. environmental protection agency is aiming to aggressively roll back obama era environmental regulations.  trump plans to sign the executive order at the epa to reduce “unnecessary regulatory obstacles that restrict the responsible use of domestic energy resources,” a white house official said. epa administrator scott pruitt told abc’s “this week” the order would help reverse the obama administration’s anti fossil fuel strategy. pruitt has publicly doubted the scientific consensus that human actions are the lead cause of climate change. his installation at the epa last month reinforced the view on both sides of the political divide that america is ceding its position as a leader in the global fight on climate change.

" if republican presidential hopeful ted cruz lands a win in the nominating contest in his home state of texas on tuesday, part of the credit will go to support from a small and often overlooked interest group: homeschoolers. the senator’s campaign has invested months of effort courting the well organized network of families who educate their children at home   often to avoid constraints on religion in public school   in the hopes they can keep a big chunk of conservative voters away from his rivals, billionaire donald trump and senator marco rubio of florida. “they were crucial to our win in iowa and will be in texas (as well),” said cruz campaign spokeswoman catherine frazier, referring to cruz’s only victory in a string of four contests for the party’s presidential nomination so far that have otherwise been swept by trump.     the cruz campaign has used its message of religious liberty and small government to draw some 6,670 members to its “homeschoolers for cruz” coalition in recent months   many of whom campaign on his behalf.     “one thing to understand about homeschoolers is we are all networked,” said ken cuccinelli, a member of homeschoolers for cruz and an occasional campaign surrogate.     he said the group has used email pleas, door knocking, and old fashioned word of mouth to win votes. “the real rock stars are the teenagers. they have so much energy... and work ethic. they just churn through work like us old people don’t.”      cruz’s campaign is betting that support like that will help him secure a win in texas   the biggest prize among the 12 states holding republican nominating contests on super tuesday. texas has 155 delegates and a big win for cruz could potentially shift the balance of the race to decide who will be the republican nominee at the nov. 8 presidential election. trump currently has 82 delegates to cruz’s 17. only around 3.5 percent of schoolchildren in the united states are homeschooled. but the families that endorse homeschooling can have outsized political influence in some states and are often conservative.     many proponents of homeschooling share two important traits: a bent toward religion and a tendency to carefully guard against education policy changes that could affect them personally. “(cruz) is going to make sure that the federal government will not infringe on what we believe is our god given right,” said will estrada, a virginia based co chair of homeschoolers for cruz and a lawyer at the home school legal defense association   which does not typically endorse candidates before the general election. homeschoolers help candidates tap into the evangelical vote, long thought to be cruz’s firewall in southern states, even though he has struggled to win the conservative christian vote amid the challenge by trump.     cruz leads trump in texas, 36.2 to 26.6 percent, according to a realclearpolitics poll average, one of few leads predicted for the texas senator for march 1 contests.      the stakes are high for cruz on tuesday. at a recent presidential forum at regent university in virginia, also a super tuesday state, cruz warned that a runaway victory for trump could make the billionaire businessman “unstoppable.”             marlin bontrager, a homeschooler parent whose family gospel band tours the country by bus, said he’s supporting cruz in part because he worries that secular education has contributed to a drop in the american intellect and the rise of trump, as well. “our educational system has(...) dumbed down our society. and we’re seeing the effect of that this election,” he said, referring to the broad support for trump.               in 2008, homeschoolers in iowa mobilized around then republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee, helping him win the state.   (additional reporting by luciana lopez; editing by richard valdmanis and alistair bell) this article was funded in part by sap. it was independently created by the reuters editorial staff. sap had no editorial involvement in its creation or production.",0
" proposed u.s. sanctions targeting myanmar s military for its treatment of rohingya muslims would hinder the fledgling civilian government sharing power with the generals, a spokesman for de facto leader aung san suu kyi said on friday. the bill, introduced by members of the u.s. senate on the eve of donald trump s departure on his first trip to asia since becoming president in january, seeks to reimpose some sanctions lifted last year as myanmar returned to democracy. the measure would impose targeted sanctions and travel curbs on myanmar military officials and bar the united states from supplying most assistance to the military until perpetrators of atrocities against the rohingya in myanmar s western rakhine state are held accountable. responding to the moves in washington, suu kyi s spokesman, zaw htay, told reuters,  we need internal stability to improve the country s economy. imposing international sanctions directly affects the people in travel and in business investments, and there are many bad consequences.  myanmar officials would explain the government s efforts on rakhine during a visit by secretary of state rex tillerson scheduled for nov. 15, he added.  we will explain to him what we are doing when he comes here. we can not tell him not to do that. and we don t know what is u.s. policy,  zaw htay said. zaw htay, a former army major who is a holdover from the quasi civilian administration that handed over the reins last year, said the army, known as the tatmadaw, had to be involved in myanmar s transition. myanmar was previously hit by sanctions over the military junta s brutal suppression of the then opposition led by suu kyi, but zaw htay stressed the civilian government still has to work with the military.    the country s reconstruction cannot be done only by the government. the tatmadaw needs to be involved, it is very clear. everything has to undergo negotiation with the tatmadaw under the 2008 constitution,  he said, referring to the charter drawn up by the junta before myanmar began its democracy transition.   sanctions and pressures affect the government s work. it won t be a positive result if they impose sanctions, as with the previous experience (of sanctions).  he added,  of course, it will damage all the business investments, not only military owned (businesses). it will definitely have a bad affect. there can only be bad results.  republican senate armed services committee chairman john mccain, and senator ben cardin, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, were among the lawmakers who have sponsored the bill.  a companion bill is also being introduced in the house of representatives.  members of congress have pressed for a strong response to the plight of the rohingya, and the trump administration has been weighing labeling the actions by myanmar s military as  ethnic cleansing . myanmar has rejected that accusation, defending the military s actions as a counter insurgency operation provoked by rohingya militant attacks on 30 security posts in rakhine state on aug. 25. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled buddhist majority myanmar since the military crackdown that has led to reports of burnt villages and widespread killings. the united nations has denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. zaw htay said myanmar was calling for the international community to  cooperate positively  on the rakhine issue, rather than focusing on what he called mere allegations of abuse by security forces.  we are not ignoring human rights abuses,  he said.  they are all allegations. the international diplomats and international organizations who are saying what happened are always using allegations, without evidence. no one can give strong evidence of their allegations, although we asked for it.  myanmar had so far been unable to take action based on the claims made by refugees in bangladesh, he said.  we will take action if they are right...so cooperate with us by showing strong evidence, rather than basing it on just allegations.

" british foreign secretary boris johnson said on tuesday he saw no reason to cancel donald trump’s state visit to britain after the u.s. president criticized mayor sadiq khan’s response to the london bridge killings. prime minister theresa may called trump’s comments “wrong.” trump has lambasted khan on twitter, accusing him of making a “pathetic excuse,” for saying londoners should not be alarmed by the sight of additional police on the streets of the british capital after saturday’s attack that killed seven people. “the invitation has been issued and accepted and i see no reason to change that, but as far as what sadiq khan has said about the reassurances he’s offered the people of london, i think he was entirely right to speak in the way he did,” johnson said in a bbc radio interview when asked whether trump’s state visit should be canceled. no date has been set for the visit, which was agreed during may’s visit to washington in january and seen as a sign of her desire to maintain good ties with britain’s traditional close ally as trump began his presidency. the conservative prime minister has said khan is doing a good job, echoing public sentiment across london. on tuesday, may told a political rally in response to a question about trump’s tweets, “i think donald trump was wrong in the things that he has said about sadiq khan.”  trump and khan, the son of pakistani immigrants and the first muslim elected as london’s mayor, have been at odds since khan denounced as “ignorant” trump’s campaign pledge to impose a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states. since taking office on jan. 20, trump has ordered temporary travel restrictions on people from several muslim majority countries, although the ban is currently held up by federal courts. asked on tuesday about the london visit, white house spokesman sean spicer said only that trump intended to go and that “he appreciates her majesty’s gracious invitation.” asked on monday evening if he would like trump’s visit to be called off, khan, a member of britain’s opposition labour party, said his position remained the same. “i don’t think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the usa in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,” khan told channel 4 news. tim farron, leader of the opposition liberal democrats, also has urged may to cancel the visit, saying trump was insulting britain’s values “at a time of introspection and mourning.” former democratic u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton, defeated by trump last november, praised khan’s performance in dealing with the attacks.  speaking at a fundraising event on monday, she did not name trump but said it was “not the time to lash out, to incite fear and use trash talk and terror for political gain,” the washington examiner reported. deputy white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters on monday that she did not think it was correct to characterize trump’s tweets as “picking a fight” with khan.  asked if trump was attacking the mayor because he is muslim, sanders replied: “not at all. and i think to suggest something like that is utterly ridiculous.” trump’s oldest son, donald trump jr., defended his father. “every time he puts something out there he gets criticized by the media. all day, every day,” trump jr. said in an interview with abc’s “good morning america” broadcast on tuesday.   “and guess what, he’s been proven right about it, every time. we keep saying, ‘it’s going to be great’ and ‘hold fast,’ ‘we’re going to keep calm and carry on.’ maybe we have to keep calm and actually do something,” he said. he was referring to a world war two era slogan of resilience, to “keep calm and carry on”, that britons have echoed following the london attack. british author j.k. rowling said on tuesday that if a state visit did go ahead, trump’s tweets related to the attack should be enlarged and shown wherever he goes. “i’d rather he didn’t come, but if he does, i’d like his vile tweets juxtaposed against whatever he’s been coaxed to read off an autocue,” rowling, celebrated for her harry potter books and a frequent critic of trump, wrote on twitter.

" thirteen hong kong universities and academic institutions accused the chinese ruled city s leader of undermining freedom of expression amid a row over pro independence banners appearing on campuses. hong kong, a former british colony that returned to china in 1997, is guaranteed freedoms and a high degree of autonomy under a  one country, two systems  arrangement, including freedom of expression. at the start of the academic year, banners advocating independence from china appeared on noticeboards in at least seven universities. some large black banners were hung across buildings. hong kong leader carrie lam criticized the posters as a violation of china s sovereignty, while urging university administrators to take  appropriate action . some colleges, including the prestigious chinese university, described the posters as unconstitutional, but allowed some to remain. but late on sunday, the 13 institutions issued a statement titled  arming ourselves in our darkest hour , criticizing lam and university authorities for  an explicit effort to limit our freedom of expression .  student unions stress that everyone enjoys the freedom of speech, and this is the line that we shall never compromise ... we are ready to defend our rights and liberty,  it read. some observers said the controversy could be used to justify another squeeze on the city s freedoms, soon after several young pro democracy leaders were jailed for helping lead the city s massive  occupy  pro democracy civil disobedience movement in late 2014.   the row has also stoked tension between local and mainland students, who now comprise a sizeable part of university admissions, especially in post graduate studies. calls for independence, once rare in the financial hub, began to gain traction after the 2014 protests and as disillusionment grew toward china s perceived tightening grip. late last year, two pro independence lawmakers were disqualified from office after beijing s parliament ruled their oath taking carried digs at china.  beijing resolutely opposes talk of hong kong splitting from china, with the mini constitution stating the city is an  inalienable  part of the country. the so called basic law also enshrines freedom of expression. groups of students from both sides have faced off on several occasions, with mainland students putting up anti independence posters, condemning calls for independence.  one female student from china was filmed and challenged for tearing down some of the pro independence banners.  if you re talking about democracy, you can put them up (the banners) and i can pull (them) down,  she said in the video.  an official blog run by china s state mouthpiece, the people s daily, on sunday published a long editorial saying there were limits to freedom of expression and that hong kong laws on public order could be used to jail trouble makers.  it is quite apparent that beijing and the hong kong government would like to use this excuse to impose a political crackdown,  said political commentator joseph cheng.  certainly the pro beijing establishment has been asking for rapid legislation of the controversial article 23 legislation,  cheng added, referring to proposed national security laws that would criminalize perceived acts of sedition.

" yemen s sanaa airport, damaged in an air strike by a saudi led coalition last week, has been repaired and is ready to receive international flights, the houthi led government which runs the capital city said on tuesday. the nov. 14 raid destroyed radio navigation equipment at the airport and in effect put the facility out of service. the attack happened after the coalition banned naval, air and land transportation to yemen following a missile fired by the houthis that was shot down over the saudi capital riyadh. the transport minister in the houthi run government, zakariya al shami, said that technical civil aviation teams had completed implementation of technical alternatives necessary to restore services to the airport .  it is ready to receive international flights,  shami said, according to houthi controlled news agency saba. the airport had been mainly used by international relief agencies, including u.n. staff, using united nations flights to sanaa. the coalition has said that all yemeni land crossings, air and sea ports would remain closed until assurances are made that no weapons can reach the houthis. the coalition accuses iran of smuggling weapons, including the missile fired towards riyadh airport on nov. 4, to the houthis through yemeni ports controlled by the group. iran denies sending any weapons to the houthis. the closure of yemen s ports, including the main hodeidah port where most of the country s food supplies enter, has raised alarm around the world. the european union on tuesday urged the saudi led coalition to reopen yemen s ports and airports.  while fully recognizing the serious security threat incoming from yemen, it is our firm belief that hindering vital humanitarian access to the yemeni population that is already on the brink of famine and subject to a spreading cholera outbreak will not effectively address these security concerns,  eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini said.

" u.s. house speaker paul ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on thursday, part of his agenda to unify republicans after a divisive primary campaign, but softening some of the hard lines taken by the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, donald trump. the plan is sharply critical of president barack obama, blaming the democrat for “eight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat” in the syrian civil war, nuclear deal with iran, chilly relations with russia and dealings with a bellicose north korea. it would overturn or back away from what obama allies see as his foreign policy achievements, including the iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with communist ruled cuba. and it criticizes efforts to close the guantanamo detention center. “it’s not too much to say that our enemies no longer fear us and too many of our allies no longer trust us. and i think this is a direct result of the president’s foreign policy,” ryan said as he and other house republicans introduced the plan at the council on foreign relations. while not providing figures, the plan also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands “adequate, predictable budgets.” trump, whom ryan has endorsed in the presidential race, has made a promise to erect a massive wall along the mexican border   a centerpiece of his campaign. the plan announced on thursday includes a range of border security measures such as “high fencing,” aerial surveillance and radar, but not a large wall. the plan echoes some of trump’s concerns about muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways to prevent the radicalization of youths. “we must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected,” ryan’s plan said. representative michael mccaul, the chairman of the house of representatives homeland security committee, said the intention was not to target followers of any one religion, but to do everything possible to not admit those who would attack americans. “what we have to do is target the threat and make sure that they don’t come in,” said mccaul, one of several republican committee chairmen who joined ryan at the report presentation. the plan is not isolationist. it takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the united states must keep all options on the table and “eliminate terrorist sanctuaries.”  trump has been critical of some u.s. alliances. ryan’s plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of nato. it also includes many standard republican policy prescriptions, such as strong ties to israel, advocacy of severe sanctions on iran and an insistence that washington should stand up to russia. it also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self sufficient. the plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. in that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on benghazi, which many republicans cite to criticize then secretary of state hillary clinton, trump’s rival in the white house race. several of thursday’s speakers criticized clinton as they blasted obama’s foreign policy, because she was the nation’s top diplomat during the first four years of his term.  democrats sought to tie the plan to some of trump’s most controversial statements, including his rejection of alliances like nato, advocacy of waterboarding and calls for attacks on the families of terrorist suspects. “perhaps this agenda is light on details because the republican presidential candidate has offered a truly disturbing vision of america’s role in the world,” representative eliot engel, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, said in a statement. ryan, the country’s highest ranking elected republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. he unveiled an anti poverty agenda on monday. initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks.

" u.s. president donald trump said he was unsure whether his top diplomat, rex tillerson, would remain in his post for the rest of trump’s term in the white house and was “not happy” that some state department staff were not supporting his agenda.     in an interview with laura ingraham on fox news late thursday, trump attacked the department under secretary of state tillerson and said he alone determines u.s. foreign policy.     “the one that matters is me,” trump said. “i’m the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be.” asked if he planned to keep tillerson on board for the rest of his term, trump told fox, “well, we’ll see. i don’t know.”    trump left on friday on a trip to asia with tillerson following months of conflict between the two. trump’s comments drew criticism in congress, where many   fellow republicans have joined democrats in objecting to trump’s plan to slash spending on diplomacy and foreign aid, and his failure to fill key foreign policy jobs. “one would hope that if he’s the only one that matters that he at least gets some feedback from top staff who perhaps can know a little bit more about some of these things than he does,” representative eliot engel, top democrat on the house of representatives foreign affairs committee, told reuters. tensions between trump, a real estate developer and reality television star in office since january, and tillerson,  former chief executive at exxon mobil corp (xom.n), resurfaced last month amid reports tillerson had called trump a “moron” and considered resigning. tillerson later said he never considered leaving. trump  said they had a good relationship but criticized tillerson as weak. tillerson’s state department has also been at odds with the white house over global issues including rising tensions over north korea’s nuclear program. richard haass, president of the council of foreign relations, said trump’s comments spelled trouble not just for the current secretary but for overall foreign policy.  “it’s not just about rex tillerson, it’s about who comes after rex tillerson. if the president is not determined to make sure his secretary of state will succeed, the secretary of state can’t succeed,” haass told cbs news. tillerson has made overhauling the department a top priority and tightened control by consolidating his authority. critics have decried the reorganization and unfilled jobs at a time when international crises continue around the world. at a recent meeting of former national security advisers, former secretary of state colin powell told h.r. mcmaster, trump’s national security advisor, that the administration was gutting state. mcmaster replied that there were people who did not support the president’s agenda, two people present told reuters. on thursday, trump said many of the posts were not needed and he is “not happy” with others already there.  “i want my vision, but my vision is my vision,” he said. “rex is in there working hard ... he’s doing the best he can.” (this version of the story has been refiled to add dropped words in 11th paragraph) ",0
"salem, n.c./new york (reuters)   north carolina extended voting times in several precincts during tuesday’s  presidential election but colorado rejected a bid to keep polls open longer after both states experienced problems with electronic voting systems. in north carolina, advocates including the national association for the advancement of colored people had urged the state to extend voting time in eight durham county precincts until 9 p.m. est, an hour and a half past normal closing time. instead, the state board extended voting time by an hour in two precincts and less than that in the other six. in colorado, the democratic party filed a petition in the denver county district court to extend voting for two additional hours after service failures in the state’s electronic voting system in some polling places. a judge denied the request and said polls would close at 7 p.m. cst as scheduled. colorado and north carolina are both crucial battlegrounds in the u.s. presidential election between republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton. the colorado secretary of state office had opposed the extension of voting hours. “this outage didn’t stop anyone from voting. we have had two weeks of voting and everyone got a ballot,” lynn bartels, a spokeswoman for the office, said on twitter. she said anyone still in line when polls closed would have an opportunity to cast their ballot. the reverend william barber, president of the naacp in north carolina, told members of the state board of elections on a conference call tuesday evening that their refusal to extend voting hours as long as requested by local elections officials was “deeply concerning.” the problem in north carolina involved the electronic poll books used to check in voters in some precincts. at one precinct where voting was extended for 60 minutes, election officials reported there had been up to a two hour period earlier in the day where no voting took place. “we’ve fought too much voter suppression in this state over and over again,” barber said. patrick gannon, spokesman for the north carolina state board of elections, said voting was extended in just a handful of the state’s 2,704 precincts. the election board is made up of three republicans and two democrats.

" comprehensive reform of the u.s. tax code is still likely to pass by the end of 2017 despite the government spending deal president donald trump struck with democrats, u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday.  in an interview with fox business network, mnuchin said he was not worried about the plan going off track because of either  democrats, who won the surprise deal on wednesday with the republican president, or more conservative republicans making their own demands.  “it’s still very viable to get it done this year,” mnuchin said. “we have a path to get this done this year, and we’re still very hopeful that we can get it done,” he added, saying it was his and trump’s top priority.  asked whether he was concerned, however, that democrats could use the funding deal struck wednesday to make demands such as rejecting any tax cut for the wealthy or pushing for a cut for middle income earners, mnuchin said no.  instead, he said wednesday’s deal “cleared the decks 90 days to have more room to focus on taxes. i think that was a big win,” adding that he expected some democrats to back the final plan. separately, axios reported that the freedom caucus, a more conservative faction of house republicans, is planning to unveil their own tax plan that would cut the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent to 16 percent.  it would also double the standard, abandon the idea of revenue neutrality and push some kind of welfare reform, axios said, citing people familiar with the matter. asked about the report, mnuchin told fox business network: “i’m not worried about any gop revolt at all,” adding that lawmakers could push their ideas with leadership as part of a regular legislative process. mnuchin did not give any more details about the administration’s tax proposal. on wednesday, trump said he would offer more details about his tax reform plan in about two weeks.

" qatar s foreign minister suggested on tuesday that measures taken by saudi arabia and three other arab states in their dispute with qatar had hurt the u.s. led fight against islamic state, according to the text of an interview with cnbc. saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar in june, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is also home to the region s biggest u.s. military base. the four countries have said that qatar supports regional foe iran and islamists, charges doha s leaders have denied. all countries involved in the dispute are u.s. allies asked if the fight against islamic state had suffered because of the crisis, qatari foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani said,  definitely yes,  according to the cnbc international transcript. he said most of qatar s food and medicine supplies, some of which would go to the u.s. al udeid air base, normally came via its land border that is now blocked by its bigger neighbor. the airspace blockade meant that qatari aircraft providing logistical support for the base could only fly north from qatar toward iran, the minister said, and qatari officers participating in u.s. led activities against islamic state or working with bahrain based u.s. fifth fleet were expelled.  so there are a lot of things which undermine ... the global efforts in countering ... daesh,  sheikh mohammed said, referring to islamic state by an arabic acronym. the minister said his country sought to resolve the crisis through dialogue, but saudi arabia wanted to destabilize qatar.  they are into escalation, they are into thinking about regime change and other things,  sheikh mohammed said. saudi arabia and the uae have denied seeking to depose qatar s government. kuwait has been trying to resolve the dispute among its fellow arab countries and u.s. president donald trump has also said he would be willing to mediate.

" white house economic adviser gary cohn said he backed bringing back the glass steagall act, a depression era law that would revamp wall street banks by splitting their consumer lending businesses from their investment arms. the national economic council director, also a former goldman sachs (gs.n) president, expressed support to lawmakers for a banking system where firms would focus primarily on trading and underwriting securities or issuing loans. big banks have strongly opposed such a move that would fundamentally overhaul their business. reinstating the law, which was repealed in 1999, has not attracted significant attention in congress, but advocates in the white house and both parties now argue it would provide critical safeguards to prevent another financial crisis. critics of that approach say it lacks nuance and would not have prevented the last financial meltdown.  the fact cohn, widely viewed as one of wall street’s own, was willing to push that position spooked big banks’ representatives in washington. the white house confirmed cohn’s remarks in a private meeting with lawmakers on wednesday. a spokesperson said he was “simply discussing the president’s previously stated position” in favor of a “21st century glass steagall.” cohn's remarks were first reported by bloomberg. bloom.bg/2nzk5n1 the trump administration has indicated support for a return to glass steagall. the white house has stuck by the idea since it was included in the republican party platform during the presidential campaign, and treasury secretary steven mnuchin expressed interest in a modernized version of the law. when asked on thursday when large financial institutions should begin to worry about glass steagall becoming a reality, one industry representative said, “right now.” however, any legislation establishing such a firewall faces long odds in the current congress. the heads of the house and senate banking committees have indicated support for alternative approaches, and efforts to move glass steagall legislation in prior years have garnered little support. “a new glass steagall would require legislation, and it simply isn’t a priority issue in congress,” wrote ian katz, a financial policy analyst for the research firm capital alpha partners, in a note to clients. in the meeting which was arranged by senate banking committee chairman mike crapo, cohn was asked by senator elizabeth warren about glass steagall. cohn responded favorably, noting that the republican party platform supports the idea, according to sources familiar with the meeting. the meeting included lawmakers from both parties and their staff. bringing back glass steagall would likely have a significant impact on banks like jpmorgan chase & co (jpm.n), bank of america corp (bac.n) and citigroup (c.n) that have large highly intertwined commercial lending and investment banking operations, say analysts.  it would impact goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) to a lesser degree although, they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding.

" hillary clinton’s memoir about her failed attempt to win last year’s u.s. presidential election will be called “what happened,” a declaration rather than a question, her publisher said in the run up to its september 12 release.  among the things the democratic nominee will say happened are sexism against the first woman to be the presidential candidate for a major u.s. party and “an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary,” according to  publicity material from the publisher, simon and schuster.  staff in clinton’s campaign and at democratic party headquarters saw thousands of their internal emails stolen and published online last year. u.s. intelligence agencies have said that russian intelligence agencies stole the emails as part of an effort by russian president vladimir putin to foil clinton’s chances of becoming president.  putin has denied the charges, and u.s. president donald trump has expressed doubt about the conclusion of intelligence agencies he oversees. in a tweet on thursday, clinton said, “writing ‘what happened’ was hard, so is what we see every day. as we move forward & fight back, i hope this helps.”  clinton has at times faced intense scrutiny by the media and political opponents for more than 25 years since her husband, bill clinton, successfully sought the u.s. presidency in 1992. “in the past, for reasons i try to explain, i’ve often felt i had to be careful in public, like i was up on a wire without a net,” clinton wrote in the book’s introduction. “now i’m letting my guard down.”  despite polls showing the former secretary of state was expected to triumph in the election last november, clinton won only 227 electoral college votes to trump’s 304. she won the popular vote by about 2.9 million votes. since then, she has made a handful of speeches and public appearances while working on the book. in april, she told the women in the world summit in new york city that she had no intention of running for another public office and that she was writing a book that, in part, delves into what derailed her attempt to become america’s first woman president. “for people who are interested in this, the nearly 66 million people who voted for me, i want to give as clear and as credible an explanation as i can,” she said. clinton has also faulted the manner in which the federal bureau of investigation, under director james comey, investigated how she managed her email, some of which involved classified information, when she was secretary of state.  chuck schumer, the senate minority leader, told the washington post last week, “when you lose to somebody who has 40 percent popularity, you don’t blame other things — comey, russia— you blame yourself.”  clinton and trump were the most unpopular u.s. presidential candidates in modern polling history.

" democratic u.s. presidential nominee hillary clinton told federal investigators that former secretary of state colin powell suggested she use a personal email account, the new york times reported late on thursday. clinton has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation’s top diplomat. the newspaper said the information came from notes the federal bureau of investigation delivered to congress on tuesday, which contained details from a more than three hour interview the agency conducted with clinton over her private email use. the times also cited an upcoming book that described a dinner conversation where powell told clinton to use her own email except for classified information. the newspaper also reported that clinton asked powell in a 2009 email exchange about his use of email while serving under former president george w. bush. reuters could not independently verify the report. representatives for clinton could not be immediately reached late on thursday. colin powell’s office in a statement said he could not recall the dinner conversation. he did recall describing the system he used to her, but the statement did not say he suggested clinton do the same.  “he did write former secretary clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal aol email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the state department,” the statement said. “at the time there was no equivalent system within the department.”  he used a secure department computer to manage classified information, the statement said.  powell has said he had no choice besides using his private account as the department did not have a fully functioning email system of its own when he joined in 2001. republicans have repeatedly hammered clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many u.s. voters doubt her trustworthiness. fbi director james comey announced last month that no criminal charges would be filed over clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state, but rebuked her for “extremely careless” handling of classified information.

" several european countries have criticized the detention of an egyptian human rights lawyer who is helping investigate the murder of italian student giulio regeni. for the first time, germany, italy, the netherlands, britain and canada said they were  deeply concerned  at the ongoing detention of human rights lawyer ibrahim metwaly hegazy.  we are concerned at the detention conditions that ibrahim metwaly hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in egypt,  a joint statement published on the british government website said late on friday. metwaly, who founded the association of the families of the disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to geneva to attend a u.n. conference on enforced disappearances on sept. 10. members of metwaly s group said he was taken from cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention. asked about the case, two judicial sources told reuters that metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre trial detention was in accordance with the law. the sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination. rights activists say egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. the authorities deny the accusation. italian graduate student giulio regeni, who was conducting research on egyptian trade unions, disappeared in cairo in january 2016. his body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the egyptian capital on feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture. metwaly has been assisting lawyers working on the regeni case as an expert on enforced disappearances, according to one of the lawyers.

" traffic was halted, movie screenings interrupted and hundreds of thousands of people across south korea were directed to underground shelters on wednesday as part of a civil defense drill to practice in case of an attack by north korea. but south koreans are familiar with such preparations, having seen many over the decades since the height of cold war tension with a neighbor it is still technically at war with, and many people have become inured to the danger. this time, the government tried to inject some urgency and get more people taking part amid a surge of tension over north korea s weapons programs, and an exchange of dire warnings of nuclear war by both it and its sworn enemy, the united states.  we need to practice because we re still at war with north korea and people are insensitive to threats,  said hwang jae min, a 30 year old prison guard who happened to be watching a movie at a seoul cinema complex when a siren heralded the beginning of the drill. hwang was one of about 50 moviegoers led underground to take shelter from an imaginary north korean air raid. the siren sounded around the country and government officials and police flagged down traffic and tried to shepherd pedestrians to the nearest shelters. but skeptics doubted such an orchestrated exercise would be much use if and when it came to a real war.  i do strongly believe we need this drill but it doesn t seem to be working properly,  said choi in sook, a 45 year old housewife strolling down a city street when the siren went off. she did not run for cover.  it needs to be performed like it s a real war,  she said.     the drill was part of an annual joint military exercise  conducted by south korean and u.s. forces that began on monday and will run until aug. 31, and which north korea denounced as  a reckless step toward nuclear war. north korea routinely denounces military exercises by u.s. and south korean forces that it regards as thinly disguised preparations to invade it. south korea s state run television broadcast scenes from the 20 minute drill live for the first time in two years in the hope of drumming up some enthusiasm. jung han yol, director of the ministry of public affairs and safety s civil defense division, conceded that the fact that participation was voluntary meant the drill might lack some credibility. cho won cheol, emeritus professor of civil and environmental engineering of yonsei university in seoul, said there was always a problem with getting people involved in government preparations for a war few people believe will happen.  the reason why the drill is not working well is the country s civil defense drill has always been practiced mostly by the government or civil officials, not by the civilians,  cho said. south korea and is main ally the united states are technically still at war with the north because their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

" a group of 37 u.s. based scientists whose research focuses on arctic wildlife asked two u.s. senators in a letter on thursday not to open the national arctic wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, according to a copy seen by reuters. the scientists, including several retired former officials from the alaska department of fish & game, the u.s. geological survey and the u.s. fish & wildlife service, said in a letter to senator lisa murkowski of alaska and senator maria cantwell of washington that drilling for oil and gas in the refuge would be “incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established,” protecting fish and wildlife populations and the environments in which they live.   murkowski, a republican, introduced legislation on wednesday that would create an oil and gas exploration program on the refuge’s coastal plain, letting prospectors build any roads and other infrastructure they deemed necessary inside the refuge to carry out their operations. half of the available drilling royalties would go to the state of alaska and half to the federal government. the program’s administrator would be required to hold at least two lease sales within 10 years after the bill became law.  the scientists said drilling on the coastal plain would be particularly harmful because it contains a “unique compression” of habitats supporting animals like polar bears, grizzly bears, wolverines, representing “the greatest wildlife diversity of any protected area above the arctic circle.” in a reuters interview, cantwell praised the scientists for spelling out why drilling would be so harmful to the refuge and she would work to oppose the legislation.  “to try to legislate mandated drilling in a wildlife refuge is just not where america is,” she said.  murkowski’s spokeswoman declined to comment and referred a comment request to the senate energy and natural resources committee.  the conflict over whether to allow drilling inside the refuge has deep roots. the u.s. geological survey estimates the area on the prudhoe bay in northern alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude, and republicans, who now control congress and the white house, have long wanted to open a portion of the refuge called the 1002 area.  murkowski, who chairs the senate energy committee, called the 1002 portion a “non wilderness area” because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. last month, democrats tried and failed to pass legislation blocking drilling there.

" the trump administration on friday dropped a lawsuit accusing north carolina of discriminating against lgbt residents after the state replaced its “bathroom bill”, although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court. in a two sentence court filing the justice department said it had dropped its lawsuit, filed last year by the obama administration, because the north carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called house bill 142. the filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the state’s nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law, known as house bill 2 or more commonly as the “bathroom bill.” house bill 2’s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity. a number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted north carolina because they saw the year old law as discriminatory against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) community. civil liberties groups also protested the move. the american civil liberties union, the aclu of north carolina, and lambda legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in march of last year. that was followed in may by the justice department’s own suit against house bill 2. james esseks, the aclu’s lgbt project director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access. the legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access, he said. house bill 142 “leaves transgender people in limbo and that’s intentional,” esseks said. “this does not fix the problem. it creates confusion.” esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill.

" republican maine governor paul lepage on monday sued the state’s democratic attorney general, contending she had abused her power by joining legal opposition to early moves by president donald trump that lepage’s office supported. lepage, a fiery conservative now in his second term, challenged attorney general janet mills for joining a legal brief opposing trump’s executive order banning immigration from a half dozen majority muslim countries. the governor said he supported trump’s order, which has been blocked by courts and which the white house says is necessary to protect national security. “it is no secret that attorney general mills and i have differing political views, but that is not the issue,” lepage said in a statement. “the problem is she has publicly denounced court cases which the executive branch has requested to join and subsequently refuses to provide legal representation for the state.” he said mills had refused to represent the state in other cases where she disagreed with lepage’s political position and prevented his office from filing its own brief in support of trump, a charge that mills denied. “instead of signing onto another party’s brief at no cost to the taxpayers, however, or hiring a lawyer to draft his own brief, the governor has wasted state resources by hiring a lawyer to file a frivolous lawsuit, complaining that he cannot do exactly what we have told him he can do,” mills said in a statement. maine is the only one of the 50 u.s. states where the attorney general is elected by the state legislature, rather than elected by voters or appointed by the governor.      the nation’s 22 democratic attorneys general emerged in the first months of the trump administration as a major opposition force to his policies, successfully suing to block his executive orders on travel and also challenging environmental policy moves. maine is one of eight u.s. states that have a republican governor and a democratic attorney general, setting the stage for the conflict that resulted in monday’s lawsuit, filed in kennebec county superior court. lepage was first elected to office in 2010 on a wave of tea party support and was re elected in 2014. both victories came in three way races.  he was an early supporter of trump and came under intense public pressure last year after calling a democratic lawmaker a “little son of a bitch, socialist cocksucker,” in a voicemail message that was widely circulated.

" obama administration officials told u.s. lawmakers on wednesday they would oppose new sanctions on iran if they interfere with last year’s international nuclear agreement, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. “if legislation were to undermine the deal, by taking off the table commitments that we had put on the table, that would be a problem,” adam szubin, the acting treasury department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a house of representatives hearing. “certainly our allies around the world would see us taking back major chunks of the sanctions relief as bad faith,” szubin told a senate banking committee hearing later on wednesday. house and senate members are drafting new sanctions measures, accusing iran of supporting terrorism, human rights abuses and violating its international commitments by testing ballistic missiles. they want to renew the iran sanctions act, a broad u.s. law imposing sanctions over iran’s nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of 2016. administration officials have urged congress not to rush to renew the isa. lawmakers argue that new sanctions will help send a message that washington will take a hard line, despite the nuclear pact. every republican in congress and several of president barack obama’s fellow democrats opposed the agreement. “i feel it’s not so terrible to have congress come up with new sanctions if we feel iran is violating its agreements,” said representative eliot engel, top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, who opposed the nuclear pact. szubin and stephen mull, the state department’s lead coordinator for implementing the nuclear deal, told lawmakers that, so far, the deal announced in july 2015 was being fully implemented. they said the administration was tightly tracking iran’s compliance. “we believe that we and our allies in the region are considerably safer,” mull said.  members of congress recently accused the administration of allowing sanctions workarounds that might provide iran direct or indirect access to the u.s. financial system. szubin reiterated the administration’s assurances that it had no such plans. despite the easing of nuclear sanctions under the international agreement, tehran’s hopes of rapidly ending its economic isolation have been complicated by companies’ concerns that doing business with iran might violate non nuclear sanctions that remain in place.

" europe s  big four  continental powers and three african states agreed a plan on monday to tackle illegal human trafficking and support nations struggling to contain the flow of people across the desert and mediterranean sea.    the 28 nation european union has long struggled to reach a coherent answer to the influx of migrants fleeing war, poverty and political upheaval in the middle east and africa, and the crisis is testing cooperation between member states. after hosting the leaders of germany, italy, spain, chad, niger and libya, french president emmanuel macron said it was time for greater coordination.    we must all act together   from the source countries to europe and passing by the transit countries, especially libya   to be efficient,  he told reporters.  it s a challenge as much for the eu as for the african union.  while the meeting was sparse on concrete details, the leaders agreed on the principle of setting up a mechanism to identify legitimate migrants who are fleeing war and persecution, and to use the united nations to register them in niger and chad so as to prevent them being exploited by traffickers.  at the core of it, it s all about fighting illegal migration,  german chancellor angela merkel told a news conference.  she said that berlin was willing to increase its efforts.  if we want to stop human traffickers, then this can only be achieved through development aid,  she said. the migrant crisis has put paris and rome at odds. italy has accused france and other eu states of not sharing the migrant burden and has also asked the eu commission for more budget flexibility to help it tackle the crisis.  nearly 120,000 migrants, including refugees, have entered europe by sea so far this year, according to the international organization for migration. more than 2,400 have drowned while making the dangerous journey, often without enough food or water in overcrowded dinghies run by people smugglers.  we are all committed to reducing the damage, the death of africans in the desert, the death of africans crossing the mediterranean,  chad president idriss deby said.   the fundamental problem will always remain development. we need resources,  he said. the informal meeting did not outline any new specific financing and the leaders repeated that stabilizing chaotic libya, where thousands of migrants end up before embarking on a perilous mediterranean sea journey to europe, would be key to any long term solution.

" singapore has banned two muslim foreign preachers from entering the city state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony, the government said on monday. the decision to block ismail menk, identified by local media as a zimbabwean and haslin bin baharim as a malaysian, is the latest move by the singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views. menk has preached muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals, singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement.  it accused baharim of holding views that promote discord between muslims and non muslims, whom he described as  deviant.   (their views) are unacceptable in the context of singapore s multi racial and multi religious society,  the ministry said.  reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair. singapore is predominantly chinese, many of whom follow buddhism and taoism but 14 percent of the population is muslim and nearly 19 percent christian.   authorities in the city state, an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon, are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony. over the past few years, singapore increased its level of surveillance for islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of islamic state in the region. menk and baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from singapore next month after their applications for short term work passes to preach in singapore were turned down, the government said.     they will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from singapore,  the home ministry said. last month, authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign christian preachers to speak in singapore as they had made  denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions.

" a russian media group which angered some in the kremlin by reporting on the business interests of people close to president vladimir putin was sold on friday to the owner of a tabloid that is deferential to the russian leader. businessman grigory berezkin’s esn group said in a statement it has acquired a 65 percent stake in the rbc media holding, plus debt, from onexim group, which is controlled by metals magnate mikhail prokhorov. the completion of the deal marks the end of a seven year period when rbc under the ownership of prokhorov published hard hitting investigations, including into the business affairs of putin’s inner circle. it stood out from most of the mainstream media in russia, which are either controlled by the state or state run companies, or tend to steer clear of topics which could anger powerful officials. last year, according to several people familiar with the kremlin’s thinking, some figures close to putin grew angry with rbc’s coverage. around the same time, russian law enforcement officers in ski masks raided the offices of onexim. soon after, the media group’s editor in chief left the country, and new senior managers were brought in from a state run news agency. a large proportion of the group’s journalists resigned, saying they anticipated restrictions on the topics on which they could report. “apparently the asset became toxic, and they (the owners) wanted to get rid of it,” elizaveta osetinskaya, the former editor in chief, told reuters on friday. the kremlin has always denied having pressured rbc over its reporting or being involved in prokhorov’s decision to sell.  the deal has been under negotiation for weeks. financial details have not been disclosed. berezkin, the new owner, already owns the komsomolskaya pravda tabloid newspaper. its pages are usually dominated by crime stories and celebrity gossip. critical reporting on the president or his senior allies is rare in the newspaper. a spokeswoman for esn group declined to comment on whether the new owner would change rbc’s senior staff or editorial policy. osetinskaya, the former editor, said that after her departure last year, rbc had continued to report independently. she said when it gave prominent coverage to anti kremlin protests in march, she thought that might lead to problems for the group. “perhaps they did not restrain themselves sufficiently,” she said of rbc’s current management.

" the head of the philippines  anti narcotics agency on friday warned of a reduced intensity in the country s war on drugs after a removal of police from the campaign, which he hoped would only be temporary as his unit lacked manpower. philippine drug enforcement agency (pdea) chief aaron aquino said he had only a fraction of the personnel and budget of police, and hoped president rodrigo duterte s decision to make his agency responsible for all operations would not be lasting.   i know the public has high expectations but i am asking the public for understanding because of our limitations,  he said in a radio interview.  i hope this is just a temporary arrangement, we need the police.  amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct, the mercurial duterte issued a memorandum on tuesday ordering police to withdraw. the authorities said the shift in strategy was to go after big drug syndicates. national police chief ronald dela rosa on friday said police could now focus efforts on catching mysterious gunmen who were assassinating drug users, to disprove allegations by human rights groups that police were behind such killings. police say they have killed 3,900 people in their anti drugs operations over the past 15 months and deny allegations by activists that many of those were executions. police say they used deadly force in each of those cases, because suspects were armed and had resisted arrest. in a tirade on thursday loaded with profanity and aimed at his foreign and domestic critics, duterte said deaths during pdea s operations were far less than police, and hoped  bleeding hearts  would be satisfied with his decision. pdea s aquino said the public might notice a slowdown in operations. he planned to ask for a bigger budget, to add 1,000 1,500 agents a year until 2022, adding it was unrealistic to expect the pdea to fight the problem with its small numbers.  pdea has about 2,000 personnel, 1,100 of which are agents, compared to more than 175,000 police nationwide. amid anger over a high profile kidnap and murder case involving police, duterte suspended police from the drugs war in january and put pdea in charge. he reinstated police soon after, saying drugs had flooded back to the streets.  in an interview with cnn philippines, police chief dela rosa suggested duterte s shift in strategy might have been a response to opinion polls that showed some public unease about the crackdown. a survey on sunday showed a significant slide in duterte s ratings, but another one by a different pollster, released on friday, showed he was still hugely popular. dela rosa said police were winning the campaign, having cut the drugs supply, made 113,000 arrests and convinced what he said were 1.3 million people to surrender. however, he said it was  not a total victory . he said police would concentrate on stopping the shadowy gunmen on motorcycles who were killing drug users, which police have often described as vigilante murders. such killings are among the 2,600 murders since july last year that police believe may have been drug related.  people think these are also policemen, so i want these people stopped and arrested,  dela rosa said.  we are intensifying intelligence, maximizing police visibility to stop these criminals. we have to shoot them before they can shoot their targets.

" zimbabwe electoral commission (zec) chairwoman rita makarau resigned on friday, months before a vote whose credibility is crucial to the new army backed government s efforts to re engage international lenders and lure investors, a senior government source said. makarau, seen as an ally of 93 year old former president robert mugabe, gave no reason for her resignation, the official, who declined to be named, said. president emmerson mnangagwa, who was sworn in two weeks ago in the wake of the de facto military coup that ended mugabe s 37 year rule, pledged to hold elections as scheduled next year. finance minister patrick chinamasa mentioned the credibility of the elections at least five times in a budget speech on thursday, a sign of the vote s importance in shoring up harare s democratic legitimacy. opposition parties have demanded reforms to an electoral system they say is skewed in the ruling zanu pf party s favor. makarau, who has been accused of being partisan, was overseeing an overhaul of the voters  roll, which the opposition movement for democratic change has described as  shambolic . makarau did not answer her mobile phone. a spokesman for the zec was unable to confirm makarau s departure.

" former u.s. house speaker dennis hastert, convicted last year of a financial crime in a hush money case, had agreed to pay $3.5 million to buy the silence of an individual who he sexually abused when the victim was a teenager, federal prosecutors said on friday. it was the first time that prosecutors, in a new court filing, had said that hastert had been extorted to keep quiet allegations he sexually abused a 14 year old victim decades ago. in the filing the prosecutors accuse hastert, 74, of molesting several boys when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of yorkville, illinois in the 1960s and 1970s.  though the statute of limitations has expired on prosecuting hastert for sex abuse, “with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted,” the prosecutors said in the filing. the former republican speaker of the house of representatives has admitted to paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades to buy that person’s silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual.    hastert’s lawyers have not revealed the misconduct at issue. there was no immediate response to an email to one of his attorneys, thomas green, seeking comment on the details in the prosecutors’ filing. hastert faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in october to a federal charge of “structuring”   evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in small increments. on wednesday, his attorneys urged a federal judge to spare him prison time for health reasons and because he is “deeply sorry.”     prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months in exchange for hastert’s guilty plea. the defense asked that he be sentenced to probation only, citing his deteriorating medical condition. hastert is scheduled to be sentenced on april 27, according to the chicago tribune.

"hillary clinton matched president obama s historically low percentage of the jewish vote, driving a third of jews into the republican camp, an unheard of percentage before obama s pro-iran policies. obama also turned jews off by his blatant personal antipathy to israel s prime minister, so the question was whether jews would come back as a voting bloc for clinton, who is thought of as a friend to israel by many jews, merely by association with her husband.the answer is no, jews did not return to the democratic fold.the retired democratic jews of florida were a crucial demographic clinton had to carry, and she didn t, according to lori lowenthal marcus, co-founder of jewschoosetrump.org.experienced political strategist dan rodriguez, founder and ceo of the mgr group, spent the run-up to election day and the big day itself in florida. in the aftermath of the election, he has been traveling to boards of elections in heavily jewish voting districts. he explained that from raw data, jewish votes are difficult to distinguish because they get lumped in with white votes. yet clinton  received only 32 percent of the white votes (into which jewish votes are lumped) in miami-dade [county], whereas obama took 37 percent,  rodriguez told me. in addition, he said,  voters 45 or older, a significant portion of whom are jewish, went strongly for trump, 56 percent to clinton s 42 percent. trump also won the support of passionately pro-israel las vegas casino magnate sheldon adelson, who may have donated more than $75 million to fuel a much needed ad campaign, which ran on all the sports channels and elsewhere in the final two weeks before the election.   american thinker ",1
"on a never-before-released private october conference call with house republican members, house speaker paul ryan told his members in the u.s. house of representatives he was abandoning then-gop presidential nominee donald trump forever and would never defend him ever again. in the oct. 10, 2016 call, from right after the access hollywood tape of trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election, ryan does not specify that he will never defend trump on just the access hollywood tape he says clearly he is done with trump altogether. i am not going to defend donald trump not now, not in the future,  ryan says in the audio, obtained by breitbart news and published here for the first time ever.now, ryan still the speaker has pushed now president donald trump to believe his healthcare legislation the american health care act would repeal and replace obamacare when it does not repeal obamacare. ryan has also, according to trump ally sen. rand paul (r-ky), misled president trump into believing that ryan s bill can pass congress. paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the u.s. senate since a number of gop senators have come out against it, and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the house. this is the first major initiative that trump has worked on with ryan and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether speaker ryan, the gop s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported trump at all in 2016, really understands how trump won and how to win in general.the october conference call apparently was intended only for house republican members. it s unclear which or how many house republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. the remarks on the portion provided to breitbart news certainly sound like they were coming from speaker ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. he says not only will he not defend the access hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with trump at all between this call on oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on nov. 8 and that ryan would not defend trump on anything generally. for entire story- matthew boyle, breitbart newslisten:",1

" foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to u.s. government officials about what they say are inflammatory and insulting public statements by republican presidential front runner donald trump, according to senior u.s. officials.  officials from europe, the middle east, latin america and asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of trump’s statements, said three u.s. officials, who all declined to be identified.  read more: trump's foreign policy team is still tbd “as the (trump) rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so,

they included at least india, south korea, japan and mexico.  u.s. officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign. u.s. allies in particular usually don’t want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.  senior leaders in several countries — including britain, mexico, france, and canada — have already made public comments criticizing trump’s positions. german economy minister sigmar gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on sunday.  trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the private diplomatic complaints.read more: nike suspends ties with sharapova after failed

his plan to build a border wall to stop illegal immigration was “absurd.”  the foreign officials have been particularly disturbed by the anti immigrant and anti muslim themes that the billionaire real estate mogul has pushed, according to the u.s. officials.  european and middle eastern government representatives have expressed dismay to u.s. officials about anti muslim declarations by trump that they say are being used in recruiting pitches by the islamic state and other violent jihadist groups.  on dec. 7, trump’s campaign issued a written statement saying that he was “calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”  trump subsequently said in television interviews that american muslims traveling abroad would be allowed to return to the country, as would muslim members of the u.s. military or muslim athletes coming to compete in the united states.  there are also concerns abroad that the united states would become more insular under trump, who has pledged to tear up international trade agreements and push allies to take a bigger role in tackling middle east conflicts.  “european diplomats are constantly asking about trump’s rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic,” said a senior nato official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  “with the eu facing an existential crisis, there’s more than the usual anxiety about the u.s. turning inward when europe needs u.s. support more than ever.”  another of the senior u.s. officials said the complaints are coming mostly from mid to low ranking diplomats – described as “working level”   rather than from the most senior officials.  “the responses have ranged from amusement to befuddlement to curiosity,” the official said. “in some cases, we’ve heard expressions of alarm, but those have been more in response to the anti immigrant and anti refugee sentiment as well as the general sense of xenophobia.”  more than a hundred republican foreign policy veterans pledged this week to oppose trump, saying in an open letter that his proposals would undermine u.s. security.  on tuesday, general philip breedlove, the united states’ top military commander in europe, said that the u.s. elections were stirring concerns among america’s allies.  “i get a lot of questions from our european counterparts on our election process this time in general,” said breedlove, who did not mention trump by name. “and i think they see a very different sort of public discussion than they have in the past.”  while not confirming the content of private diplomatic contacts, some foreign officials acknowledged their governments’ concerns about trump.  a british official noted that in january, prime minister david

" republican donald trump’s selection of indiana governor mike pence as his running mate cheered the u.s. energy industry and dismayed green advocates, with both sides citing pence’s support for coal mining and defiance of president barack obama’s climate change agenda. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, has called climate change a hoax and promised to gut u.s. environmental regulations in order to help the ailing oil and coal sectors. a trump pence ticket will quash any expectation that the new york businessman might soften that stance heading into the nov. 8 election. “governor pence has been a vocal opponent of the administration’s clean power plan,” said laura sheehan, spokeswoman for the washington based lobby group american council on clean coal electricity.   “we would hope to see a continuation,” she said. trump announced pence as his running mate in a twitter post on friday morning, ending days of speculation over the choice ahead of the party’s national convention in cleveland next week. [nl1n1a10hr] pence, 57, is listed on obama’s “call out the climate change deniers” website for arguing that the science behind climate change has not yet been resolved. in june 2015, pence wrote to obama saying that indiana, america’s eighth largest coal producing state, would not comply with the clean power plan regulating power plant emissions, calling it “ill advised.” indiana is one of more than 25 states that have challenged the centerpiece of the democratic president’s environmental agenda. in 2014, pence alarmed local environmental groups by overturning an energy efficiency program enacted by his republican predecessor, mitch daniels, saying it was too expensive for the state’s manufacturers. the indiana public utility commission had estimated the program would create more than 18,600 jobs. “the choice of pence shows trump has little interest in appealing to anyone outside of his extremist base and big polluters,” said clay schroers, a director at the league of conservation voters environmental group.     trump has long signaled his support of traditional energy production   part of his broader appeal to blue collar american voters.  he outlined plans in may to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by obama, scrap the paris climate accord, and revive the keystone xl pipeline proposal – moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. trump’s democratic rival, hillary clinton, in contrast, has promised more stringent regulation of the energy sector, efforts to boost renewable fuels use, and a commitment to join other nations to combat global climate change. pence ran for governor in 2012 after serving in the u.s. congress. his campaign for governor received more than $850,000 from the energy sector, about 3 percent of the total, according to campaign finance disclosures. more than $300,000 of that came from the billionaire koch brothers, strong advocates of small government and fiscal conservatism who took a liking to pence. both david and charles koch have said they will not support the trump ticket. trump has alarmed many republican establishment figures with his fiery rhetoric on immigration and trade.  but a former high ranking operative in the koch political organization who is close to both brothers said pence could help make the donor network more receptive to trump’s campaign.

" pope francis strongly defended immigrants at his christmas eve mass on sunday, comparing them to mary and joseph finding no place to stay in bethlehem and saying faith demands that foreigners be welcomed. francis, celebrating his fifth christmas as leader of the world s 1.2 billion roman catholics, led a solemn mass for about 10,000 people in st. peter s basilica while many others followed the service from the square outside. security was stepped up, with participants checked as they approached st. peter s square even before going through metal detectors to enter the basilica. the square had been cleared out hours earlier so security procedures could be put in place.  the gospel reading at the mass in christendom s largest church recounted the biblical story of how mary and joseph had to travel from nazareth to bethlehem to be registered for a census ordered by roman emperor caesar augustus.  so many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of joseph and mary. we see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. we see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones,  francis said. even the shepherds who the bible says were the first to see the child jesus were  forced to live on the edges of society  and considered dirty, smelly foreigners, he said.  everything about them generated mistrust. they were men and women to be kept at a distance, to be feared.  wearing white vestments in the flower bedecked church, francis called for a  new social imagination ... in which none have to feel that there is no room for them on this earth.  the 81 year old pope, who was born of italian immigrant stock in argentina, has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, often putting him at odds with politicians. austria s new chancellor, sebastian kurz, has aligned himself with central european neighbors like hungary and the czech republic in opposing german backed proposals to distribute asylum seekers around eu member states. in elections in germany in september, the far right and anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) party made significant gains, with electors punishing chancellor angela merkel for her open door policy and pushing migration policy to the top of the agenda in talks to form a coalition government. italy s anti immigrant northern league, whose leader matteo salvini often gives fiery speeches against migrants, is expected to make gains in national elections next year. a law that would give citizenship to children born in italy to migrant parents is stalled in parliament. in his homily, francis said,  our document of citizenship  comes from god, making respect of migrants an integral part of christianity.  this is the joy that we tonight are called to share, to celebrate and to proclaim. the joy with which god, in his infinite mercy, has embraced us pagans, sinners and foreigners, and demands that we do the same,  francis said. francis also condemned human traffickers who make money off desperate migrants as the  herods of today  with blood on their hands, a reference to the biblical story of the king who ordered the killing of all newborn male children near bethlehem because he feared jesus would one day displace him. more than 14,000 people have died trying to make the perilous crossing of the mediterranean to europe in the past four years. on christmas day, francis will deliver his twice yearly  urbi et orbi  (to the city and to the world) blessing and message from the central balcony of st. peter s basilica.

into the matter. trump sought to focus attention on what he called criminal intelligence leaks about his ousted national security adviser, michael flynn. trump forced flynn out on monday after disclosures he had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office, and that he later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations. the drama of flynn’s departure was the latest in a series of white house missteps and controversies since the republican president was sworn in on jan. 20. at a news conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday, trump said flynn, a retired u.s. army lieutenant general, was a “wonderful man” who had been mistreated by the news media. but republican trump critics including senators john mccain and lindsey graham voiced fresh consternation. adding to the pressure were comments by senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker, who has been a trump supporter. corker said the russia issue was threatening trump’s agenda on foreign affairs and domestic matters like healthcare and tax policy. he questioned whether the white house was able to stabilize itself and said flynn should testify before congress. “let’s get everything out as quickly as possible on this russia issue,” corker told msnbc’s “morning joe” program. “maybe there’s a problem that obviously goes much deeper than what we now suspect.” democrats, doubting trump’s justice department or the republican led congress will pursue the matter vigorously, have demanded an independent investigation of possible illegal communications between flynn and the russian government and any efforts by flynn or other white house officials to conceal wrongdoing. the most powerful democrat in the senate, chuck schumer, said attorney general jeff sessions, a close ally of trump, must recuse himself from any investigation. the republican and democratic leaders of the u.s. senate judiciary committee asked sessions and fbi director james comey on wednesday to send the committee documents and provide a briefing on flynn’s resignation. citing reports that both the federal bureau of investigation and justice department were involved in events leading to flynn’s departure, senators chuck grassley and dianne feinstein said they raised “substantial questions” about flynn’s discussion with russian officials. graham called for a broader bipartisan congressional investigation to be conducted by a newly formed special committee rather than existing committees, if it turns out  trump’s presidential campaign communicated with the russians. but the top republicans in the senate and house of representatives have insisted the matter be investigated by existing republican led committees. the senate and house intelligence committees and a subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee have announced they launched investigations into alleged russian efforts to influence the election through computer hacking. u.s. intelligence agencies previously concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the nov. 8 election in trump’s favor. congressional inquiries into alleged russian interference in the u.s. elections are gaining momentum as capitol hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents.  the fbi and several u.s. intelligence agencies are investigating russian espionage operations in the united states. they are also looking at contacts in russia between russian intelligence officers or others with ties to president vladimir putin’s government and people connected to trump or his campaign. the fbi recently questioned flynn about his telephone contacts with the russian ambassador in washington. people familiar with the agency’s multiple probes said there was no evidence so far of pre election collusion between russians and trump’s campaign, or any evidence of criminal activity by flynn or anyone else connected to trump. some experts expressed concern the white house could curtail or divert probes into flynn and russian involvement in the election unless congress becomes more aggressive by holding hearings and appointing an independent commission or special prosecutor into whether trump’s team violated federal laws in their contacts with russia. intelligence agencies now overseen by trump may not be ideally suited to the job, they added. “it’s not, at the end of the day, the job of the intelligence community to regulate the white house   and it shouldn’t be,” said stephen vladeck, a university of texas law professor who focuses on constitutional law and national security. ‘very un american’ in twitter posts on wednesday, trump called the reported russian connection with his campaign team nonsense and said the leaks were the “real scandal.” from early on in his white house bid, trump said he would like improved relations with putin, a stance criticized by democrats and those republicans concerned about washington softening its stance after russia’s annexation of crimea from ukraine and aggression in syria. only a few republican lawmakers have supported even the idea of extending any investigation to cover actions by trump’s team in the weeks after the election, when flynn made his calls. some republicans, including house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes, are calling for investigations into leaks to the news media of conversations between flynn and russia’s ambassador in washington. the trump administration has offered flynn’s former job to u.s. navy vice admiral robert harward, said two u.s. officials familiar with the matter. it was not immediately clear if harward, a former deputy commander of u.s. central command, had accepted the offer, according to sources.

" the special counsel investigating russian interference in the u.s. presidential election has asked the white house for documents on a range of subjects including president donald trump’s firing of the fbi director and his son’s meeting with a russian lawyer, the new york times reported on wednesday. the times reported that special counsel robert mueller’s office had sent the white house a document outlining 13 areas of interest about which investigators were seeking additional documentation. peter carr, a spokesman for mueller, declined a request by reuters to comment on the matter. ty cobb, the white house lawyer handling requests from mueller’s office, told reuters, “out of respect for the special counsel and its process, the white house does not comment on exchanges between the special counsel and the white house.”  “the white house remains committed to cooperate fully with the special counsel,” cobb said. the subjects in the request by mueller’s office included the ouster of former trump national security adviser michael flynn and the firing of federal bureau of investigation director james comey, the times reported. according to the report, the special counsel has also asked for documents on how the white house responded to questions about a june 2016 meeting involving trump’s son, donald trump jr., and a russian lawyer who had offered to provide damaging information about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. the 2016 meeting was also attended by trump’s son in law jared kushner and his former campaign manager paul manafort. mueller’s investigation and two congressional panels are looking into conclusions by u.s. intelligence agencies that russia worked to tilt last november’s election in republican trump’s favor. moscow has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion by his campaign.

" u.s. president donald trump said on tuesday he had picked an employment lawyer who has represented companies and business groups for a vacancy on the national labor relations board. the selection of william emanuel, 75, to fill one of the two vacancies at the agency brings it closer to having a republican majority, which is expected to undo a series of recent decisions seen as favoring unions. the five member nlrb oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers.  emanuel, a los angeles based partner at law firm littler mendelson, has worked with republicans in congress and major trade groups from an array of industries, and has for decades defended employers in cases before the board. he is a member of the conservative federalist society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing trump to nominate u.s. supreme court justice neil gorsuch to the high court. emanuel said in a statement that it is an honor to be nominated. industry groups such as the national retail federation and the national restaurant association hailed emanuel’s nomination, saying he would help repair damage done to businesses by rulings from the nlrb during the barack obama administration. trump last week said he intended to nominate fellow republican marvin kaplan, a lawyer with the federal occupational safety and health review commission, to another vacancy on the board.  the positions require confirmation by the u.s. senate.  the nlrb has been controlled by democrats for nearly a decade and they currently have a 2 1 majority. when it has no vacancies, the board typically includes three members from the president’s party and two from the opposing party. under trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former president barack obama. they include rules designed to speed the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees. it was not clear when the senate could vote on trump’s nominees but several lawyers and other experts said the process could stretch into the fall. kaplan previously worked for republicans in the u.s. house of representatives crafting employment related legislation.

" extending u.s. sanctions on iran for 10 years would breach the iranian nuclear agreement, iran supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said on wednesday, warning that tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved.  the u.s. house of representatives re authorized last week the iran sanctions act, or isa, for 10 years. the law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in iran’s energy industry and deter iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. the iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. the house bill must still be passed by the senate and signed by president barack obama to become law. iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as jcpoa, last year. it imposed curbs on iran’s nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy.  “the current u.s. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,” khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the revolutionary guards, according to his website.  “the latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against jcpoa, and the islamic republic would definitely react to it.”  the u.s. lawmakers passed the bill one week after republican donald trump was elected u.s. president. republicans in congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen democrats, and trump has also criticized it. lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against iran would continue under the new president. president elect trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from khamenei, who said if that happens, iran would “set fire” to the deal. the house of representatives also passed a bill last week that would block the sale of commercial aircraft by boeing (ba.n) and airbus (air.pa) to iran.  the white house believes that the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact and has said obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the senate.

" u.s. government officials declined on tuesday to characterize the treatment of myanmar’s rohingya muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions washington is considering to address the crisis. “i’m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that i’ve seen during a long career,” mark storella deputy assistant secretary of state from the bureau of population, refugees and migration said at a senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims have fled myanmar’s rakhine state since security forces responded to rohingya militants’ attacks on aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the united nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. myanmar, also known as burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat “terrorists” who killed civilians. but it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. many u.s. lawmakers have clamored for a strong u.s. response to the crisis and criticized government leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in washington, for failing to do more. “she’s an impressive person, but she’s not taking on the challenge,” said senator ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. cardin said he considered the treatment of the rohingya genocide. the state department said on monday that washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over myanmar’s treatment of the rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its global magnitsky law. [l2n1mz01t] at the foreign relations committee hearing, patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the u.s. government’s ability to influence the myanmar government to change.

" a federal judge in colorado blocked enforcement of a 19th century state law that bans voters from showing a completed ballot to others, the latest in a flurry of mixed legal rulings on whether to restrict election “selfies” on social media. u.s. district judge christine arguello in denver issued a preliminary injunction against an 1891 colorado statute that makes it a misdemeanor offense to reveal the contents of one’s ballot. the ruling came in response to two separate lawsuits by voters challenging enforcement of the law on grounds that it violates their free speech rights. “by issuing an injunction in this case, coloradans get what they are entitled to   clarity on an issue that implicates fundamental constitutional rights,” arguella wrote in her 26 page ruling. the controversy erupted last week after denver district attorney mitch morrissey reminded voters of the law, which he said would “include posting your completed ballot to social media.” however, prosecutors from several jurisdictions, including denver, filed declaration with the court this week saying they would not enforce the misdemeanor law unless evidence showed that voter intimidation or coercion was involved. “based on our review of applicable law and societal changes, including the ubiquity of social media ... the district attorney’s office would not charge anyone with an offense ... for taking a photograph or video of a completed colorado mail in ballot,” denver prosecutor joseph morales wrote. colorado is among 18 states that have laws restricting the taking of photographs in voting booths or of completed ballots. courts in other states and federal jurisdictions have issued mixed rulings against enforcing such bans. federal judges in new york and california refused this week to block enforcement of state laws barring voters from taking photographs of marked ballots, saying it was too close to next tuesday’s presidential election to issue such injunctions. colorado’s attorney general cited the california and new york decisions in defending colorado’s law. lawyers for the colorado voters said the state’s mail in voting system, which allows ballots to be filled out anywhere and then either mailed or dropped off, sets colorado apart from california and new york, where voters must cast ballots at a polling place. last month, a federal court sided with a voter who challenged a michigan anti selfie statute as a free speech violation.

" the white house will host talks between the rival oil and ethanol industries on wednesday in hopes of brokering a deal to help refiners struggling to meet the country’s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. the meeting comes after the white house last week pressured midwest lawmakers to take part in talks over possible tweaks to the renewable fuels standard, a law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn based ethanol, into the nation’s fuel supply each year. a handful of refiners say the law is threatening to put them out of business. but ethanol interests have said the refineries can pass along the costs at the pumps and have vehemently opposed any changes to the regulation. the meeting on wednesday will include staff from the offices of republican senators ted cruz of texas and pat toomey of pennsylvania, both representing the oil refining industry, according to the sources.  on the corn side, staff will be present from the offices of republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa, along with deb fischer of nebraska, the sources said. staff from the environmental protection agency and the u.s. department of agriculture were also expected to attend. a spokesman for grassley confirmed that “staff level dialogue and meetings” were under way but did not provide details. officials for the other senators and the white house did not comment. one source familiar with the matter said the meeting would likely focus on short term fixes to help oil refiners on the u.s. east coast who say they are struggling with the costs of meeting the rfs requirements. refining companies   like philadelphia energy solutions pesc.n and monroe energy, both of pennsylvania, along with texas giant valero energy corp (vlo.n)   that do not have adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products are required to purchase blending credits called rins from rivals that do. rins prices have surged this year.  the source said talks on wednesday could center on solutions like a price cap for rins or waivers to certain refiners that are at risk of going bankrupt without relief. the governors of both texas and pennsylvania have already formally requested such waivers from the administration. the industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners. but the trump administration has ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  last month, the environmental protection agency, the regulator which administers the rfs, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. the refining industry has also been seeking a longer term overhaul of the rfs before it expires in 2022, but such a change would require an act of congress and has met with stiff resistance from the corn lobby. the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year.

" china is testing a new dredger ship that will greatly enhance its land reclamation capabilities, a state media report said on sunday, as the country continues to develop facilities in the south china sea in a bid to strengthen its claims in the waters. state run beijing news newspaper said the tian kun began water tests on friday. a cutter suction dredger is a type of a ship used for large scale projects to create or reclaim land.       for example, there are many hard coral reefs on the sea floor of the south china sea,  the paper quoted zhang xiaofeng, chief engineer for the vessel, as saying, adding the ship will be put into service sometime in the first half of 2018.  recent satellite images show that china has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the south china sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes each year, in a bid to strengthen its grip despite objections from brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam as well as the united states. some experts say china will land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the spratly islands in coming months.  the united states is concerned china s construction of islands and military buildup in the waters could be used to restrict free nautical movement. its ships have carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area, angering china.  the subject could come up when trump visits beijing next week as part of his 12 day asia trip and meets with chinese president xi jinping, though north korea s recent nuclear and missile tests are expected to feature more prominently in talks.  the south china sea issue isn t an issue between china and the united states,  china vice foreign minister zheng zeguang told reporters on friday, adding there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the region and that china has indisputable sovereignty over islands and surrounding waters.

" the european union on wednesday called on president barack obama to block a u.s. bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the sept. 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia, saying it was in violation of international law. “the possible adoption and implementation of the (bill) would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of state sovereign immunity,” the european union delegation to the united states said in a letter to the u.s. department of state seen by reuters. the letter said the eu considers that the bill’s adoption and its implementation could have unwanted consequences, as other states adopt similar legislation.  congress has overwhelmingly passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, known as jasta, in reaction to long running suspicions, denied by saudi arabia, that hijackers of the four u.s. jetliners that attacked the united states in 2001  were backed by the saudi government.  obama in coming days is expected to veto the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue u.s. diplomats, service members or companies. but congress could have the last word if the senate and house of representatives each override that veto by a two thirds vote.

" republicans could hold onto control of virginia’s legislature after a race that had appeared to change the balance of power was ruled a tie on wednesday, setting the stage for the winner of the district to be chosen by lot. the results of a recount on tuesday showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by one vote, enough to shift the 100 member house of delegates to an even 50 50 split between democrats and republicans. however, on wednesday a three judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey, the virginian pilot newspaper reported and yancey confirmed. the two candidates in the 94th district, which includes newport news in southeastern virginia, are now tied at 11,608 votes. under virginia law, a tie in a house race should be decided by drawing lots, the equivalent of a coin toss or drawing straws, the conference of state legislatures said. “i am happy that every vote in newport news was counted and that the judges took time to deliberate before rendering a decision,” yancey said in an emailed statement. “this certainly is a historic election in our commonwealth.” but democrats slammed the decision, calling it erroneous and saying they were considering legal action to challenge it. just tuesday, republicans conceded the seat, and simonds, who made international news with what had appeared to be a narrow win, spent the morning wednesday discussing the race on a variety of news shows. she did not immediately respond to a request for comment following wednesday’s decision, but an attorney for the virginia house democratic caucus criticized the judges’ move in a news release. “today’s decision by the court was wrong, and delegate elect shelly simonds should have been certified the winner,” he said. “we are currently assessing all legal options before us as we fight for a just result.”  democrats claimed historic gains in virginia’s statehouse last month, part of the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. before the nov. 7 general election, virginia republicans held 66 seats to the democrats’ 34 in the house of delegates, along with a majority in the state senate.

" former and current employees of the u.s. environmental protection agency expressed opposition to president donald trump’s pick to run the agency on monday   in an open letter and a small street protest   reflecting divisions over the new administration’s plans to slash regulation. over 400 former epa staff members sent a letter to the u.s. senate asking it to reject the nomination of oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt as the agency’s new leader, saying “he has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws.” in chicago, around 30 employees of the epa’s regional office there joined a protest organized by the sierra club environmental group and the american federation of government employees to protest pruitt’s nomination. doug eriksen, a spokesman for trump’s transition team at the epa, downplayed the chicago protest, saying “employees have a right to take action on their private time.”     trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. he nominated pruitt, who has sued the epa more than a dozen times as oklahoma’s top prosecutor to block its regulations, to run the agency, sparking alarm among democrats and environmentalists. last thursday, the senate environment committee approved pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panel’s democratic members. he is expected to be confirmed by the full senate, in republican control after last november’s election, but a date for the vote has not been set.  the former epa employees who sent the letter to the senate wrote that they believed pruitt has a history of siding with industry and has been reluctant to accept “the strong scientific consensus on climate change.” employees at the chicago rally raised concerns that pruitt may cut employees and resources needed for the agency to enforce environmental regulations.  “the epa needs to be able to enforce the rules when companies are breaking the law,” said sherry estes, an epa lawyer who participated in the protest.

" a former vietnamese official who germany says was kidnapped in berlin to face charges in hanoi over financial losses at a state construction firm had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government, according to documents seen by reuters. the decision to re open the case and aggressively pursue prosecution shows the tougher stance taken by the ruling communist party since vietnam s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex prime minister nguyen tan dung lost out.  the party says it wants to tackle corruption but some critics have accused vietnam s rulers of embarking on a witch hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. the internal crackdown drew global attention last month when germany accused hanoi of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh, a former official with state oil firm petrovietnam. he was accused of financial mismanagement that caused losses of $150 million at petrovietnam construction (pvc) during the time he served as chairman from 2009 to 2013. but according to a letter dated may 18, 2015 from then trade minister vu huy hoang to then prime minister dung, the official had stated his responsibility but the government had not  found negative signs  relating to his actions.  therefore, authorized agencies and units agreed not to take disciplinary action over thanh,  it said, noting that he had moved to a role at the trade ministry, where he had worked hard to try to resolve the problems at petrovietnam construction.  corrective work and post inspection handling of pvc were done effectively and in accordance with the prime minister s requirements,  the letter said. responding to questions about the letter and whether there would be further prosecutions over the case, foreign ministry spokeswoman le thi thu hang said the party and state were resolute in dealing with corruption or lawbreaking by any organization or individual.  based on the results of the investigation, the functional agencies shall strictly handle those who violate the law in accordance with the provisions of vietnamese law,  she told reuters. reuters was unable to contact thanh, former trade minister hoang or former prime minister dung either directly or through government offices. thanh ran petrovietnam construction, a subsidiary of a sprawling state enterprise that is also involved in everything from oil and gas to power generation, ship building and insurance. after his return to vietnam, thanh was shown on state television saying that he had decided to surrender himself in order to face justice. the government has not said how he returned home. thanh was a relatively junior figure among those who are under investigation in relation to petrovietnam s dealings as well as in the banking sector. the most senior political casualty so far is dinh la thang, a former petrovietnam chairman who was sacked from his role in the politburo. a vice minister who had been responsible for appointing thanh has also been sacked. hoang has also been symbolically stripped of his title of former trade minister for violating state and party rules. investigations continue into petrovietnam and the trade ministry which oversaw it as well as into the central bank. there are widespread expectations that more members of dung s administration will be prosecuted. dung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of communist party general secretary, vietnam s most powerful position. the post remained in the hands of nguyen phu trong, whose modest public profile contrasts with the conspicuous wealth that some members of dung s administration displayed.  fighting and preventing corruption, waste and negativity are no longer handled slowly and case by case. it has become a movement,  trong said in july. according to a survey by transparency international conducted between july 2015 and january 2017, vietnam had become the most bribery prone country in asia after india and a majority of vietnamese believed corruption had worsened.

" the north korean nuclear issue needs a peaceful resolution, chinese president xi jinping told u.s. president donald trump in a telephone call on saturday, and called on the “relevant side” to exercise restraint, state television said. trump issued a new threat to north korea on friday, saying the u.s. military was “locked and loaded”, as pyongyang accused him of driving the korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war and world powers expressed alarm. xi told trump that it was in the joint interests of both china and the united states to achieve the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula and protect peace and stability there, state television said in a brief report. “the relevant side must at present exercise restraint, and avoid words and actions that exacerbate tensions on the korean peninsula,” the report paraphrased xi as saying. resolving the nuclear issue ultimately needs to be done politically via talks, and china is willing to maintain communication with the united states on the basis of mutual respect to push for an appropriate resolution, xi added. chinese state television cited trump as telling xi that he fully understands the role china has been playing on the north korean nuclear issue.

" a bipartisan group of 27 u.s. senators sent a letter to president elect donald trump on thursday urging him to take a tough line against russia over what they termed its “military land grab” in ukraine. the letter, whose 12 republican and 15 democratic signatories included some leading foreign policy voices from trump’s republican party, was an early sign that lawmakers will publicly assert themselves on international matters where they disagree with his white house. the new york property developer becomes president on jan. 20. trump signaled during his campaign that he might take a softer line in dealings with moscow, repeatedly praising russian president vladimir putin’s leadership. putin said recently trump confirmed to him that he was willing to mend ties. “in light of russia’s continued aggression and repeated refusal to respect ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereign right to choose its own destiny, we also renew our call for the united states to increase political, economic and military support for ukraine,” said the letter, led by senators richard durbin, a democrat, and rob portman, a republican, who are co chairmen of the senate ukraine caucus. in the letter, seen by reuters before its public release, the senators also said they believe russia’s annexation of crimea should not be accepted and the united states should not lift sanctions imposed on russia for its behavior in eastern ukraine.  president barack obama and putin have had a challenging relationship, with stark differences over russia’s actions in ukraine and syria. tensions have risen more with obama’s democratic party in particular over cyber attacks attributed to russia during the u.s. presidential election.     among republican senators who signed the letter were john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, and lindsey graham, head of the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the state department. a majority of republicans and democrats on the senate foreign relations committee, including ranking democrat ben cardin, signed the letter. jack reed, the top democrat on senate armed services, also did so.

" the 193 member united nations general assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on thursday at the request of arab and muslim states on u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital, sparking a warning from washington that it will  take names.  palestinian u.n. envoy riyad mansour said the general assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for trump s declaration to be withdrawn, which was vetoed by the united states in the 15 member u.n. security council on monday. the remaining 14 security council members voted in favor of the egyptian drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the united states or trump but which expressed  deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of jerusalem.  mansour said on monday he hoped there would be  overwhelming support  in the general assembly for the resolution. such a vote is non binding, but carries political weight. u.s. ambassador nikki haley, in a letter to dozens of u.n. states on tuesday seen by reuters, warned that the united states would remember those who voted for the resolution criticizing the u.s. decision.  the president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested i report back on those countries who voted against us. we will take note of each and every vote on this issue,  haley wrote.  she echoed that call in a twitter post: the u.s. will be taking names.  under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the general assembly to consider a matter  with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures  if the security council fails to act. only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the general assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on occupied east jerusalem and palestinian territories. thursday s meeting will be a resumption of that session.  trump abruptly reversed decades of u.s. policy this month when he recognized jerusalem as israel s capital, generating outrage from palestinians and the arab world and concern among washington s western allies. trump also plans to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv. the draft u.n. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in jerusalem.  haley said on monday that the resolution was vetoed in the security council in defense of u.s. sovereignty and the u.s. role in the middle east peace process. she criticized it as an insult to washington and an embarrassment to council members. israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. palestinians want the capital of an independent palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

the deficit too much higher is going to be key here. that makes sense why they would push the corporate tax cut back. but at the same time, we’re not getting to the point where we have a plan that seems workable yet. “the market is due for a breather. it’s been a year since the election. we’ve gone up 22 percent on hopes of what the trump agenda would bring, and while they’re trying to work toward this thing, they haven’t really accomplished much yet. if progress is not made, the equity market should either pause or correct until meaningful progress is made.” rick meckler, president of investment firm libertyview capital management in jersey city, new jersey “investors view the corporate tax cut as central to higher near term stock prices. once you delay it, the more time that goes on the more further changes can happen. this has been a bit of an emotional roller coaster for investors. “you’re starting to see some divergence between house, senate and white house, all three of which are controlled by republicans. that suggests that whatever is agreed to will probably look quite a bit different if its signed into law. “the sell off is a quick reaction to how much uncertainty is ahead when it comes to significant corporate tax change.” joe saluzzi, co manager of trading at themis trading in chatham, new jersey  “nervous nellies are going to read the headlines, i have the feeling we are going to be headline driven until they finish this thing off, whenever that may be. if it is a market that has been based on tax cuts, or a good chunk of the rally has been, you would expect it to pullback if there is a potential breakup in the talks or a delay. it looks like this last leg was based on a delay of potentially a year on the senate side. so totally expected you would see that. but i would also expect it to rip right back if all of a sudden they come out and say they are making progress.  “other than that there is really nothing fundamentally changed. nothing new today, economic numbers   nothing was really out of line. it is certainly tax driven. if there is a decent headline that comes out by the end of the day we will rally right back. maybe people are not nervous, they shouldn’t be, but i hope there is no complacency in the market, i am always worried about that. but i don’t see this as a big deal yet.”  subadra rajappa, head of u.s. strategy, sg corporate & investment banking, new york “in the bond market, we reacted initially to the selloff in europe. now we are giving some of it back because of the concerns about the implementation of the tax plan. the difference between house and senate plans have be reconciled. they have to make the math work with the agreed upon $1.5 trillion projected addition to the deficit. they feel the better start for the corporate tax cut is 2019. we saw some pressure on the high yield spreads the past few sessions with evaluations being frothy. this combined with the tax plan have put some downward pressure on yields. the news on the tax front hasn’t been very positive. the devils are always in the details. there’s a bit more worry about which of the proposals will get though and how. i personally think they would have trouble to get through reconciliation in such short order.” paresh upadhyaya, director of currency strategy at amundi pioneer investment management, boston “i think the markets are getting a bit jittery over details of the plan as it looks like it is going to be pushed off another year. the initial reaction is disappointment over the senate plan. of course that’s not going to be the final plan, but the initial reaction is certainly negative for the dollar. “the momentum of the dollar has been hit on concerns about the tax plan, that this could take longer than

" u.s. supreme court justice antonin scalia’s memorial service on saturday provided a brief respite for official washington from the fierce battle over his succession, with political and legal leaders and many others in attendance. at the blue domed basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception, the nation’s largest catholic church, dozens of priests took part in the funeral mass, led by one of the justice’s nine children, reverend paul scalia. more than 3,000 people looked on, including other family members, the court’s remaining eight justices, lawmakers, vice president joseph biden and former vice president dick cheney. “god blessed dad with a deep catholic faith,” the younger scalia told the gathering inside the cathedral. “he loved the clarity and coherence of the church’s teachings.” he fondly remembered an outburst one day after his father realized he was waiting for confession at church in a line that would have led him to his son. the justice jumped out of the line. “‘like heck if i’m confessing to you,’” the father said later to the son, who remarked: “the feeling was mutual.” a staunch conservative and the court’s longest serving member, justice scalia died last saturday at age 79 at a texas hunting resort, sparking a political struggle that promises to reshape the 2016 election campaigns. presidential candidate ted cruz, a republican senator from texas, was among those at the service. like other republicans, he has said that president barack obama, a democrat, should not choose scalia’s replacement. rather, republicans are saying no one should be named until after the presidential election in november, hoping that one of their own will be elected and get to choose the next justice.  under law, the u.s. president is responsible for nominating supreme court justices to their lifetime appointments, subject to senate review and confirmation. appointing a justice to the court is one of the biggest decisions a u.s. president can make. obama has vowed to select a successor to scalia. if he does so, senate republicans have threatened to block any nominee put forward by obama, a stance likely to become an issue in the presidential race and in election year contests for seats in the senate and the house of representatives. according to a recent reuters/ipsos poll, a majority of americans believe it should be up to obama to nominate the next  justice, with opinion divided along ideological party lines. this year the normally nine justice court is set to decide its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. the new justice’s politics could tilt the court’s balance. after scalia’s death, it has four conservative and four liberal members. appointed by republican president ronald reagan in 1986, scalia became known as a brilliant jurist in an era of conservative court dominance. he opposed abortion and same sex marriage and supported the death penalty and gun rights.

"progressive hero alan grayson is best known as the member of congress who has introduced more legislation than any other. he s remembered for his statements on the gop s lack of a plan for health insurance, stating  their plan is, if you get sick, you die.  he s also well-known for comparing the tea party to the kkk.from the outside, grayson is a true american success story. born in the bronx, grayson managed to make his way through harvard law, becoming a multi-millionaire as a trial lawyer. on the inside, however, some serious questions have arisen.a house ethics committee investigation is underway looking into a trio of hedge funds operated by grayson that may have broken several rules for second-source income, use of congressional staffers for private enterprise and misuse of government travel expenses. two of the hedge funds, that have since been closed, were located in the cayman islands, and one in the us.as a united states congressman, grayson is forbidden from earning more than $27,500 from a second source. while he states he had no taxable income from the funds during his time as a congressman, which include terms from 2009-2011 and 2013 to present. grayson started the funds in 2012 while not serving, but kept them open when he won reelection for 2013. the question of his income comes because he was still listed as a manager of the fund, which typically comes with a price tag.emails from grayson s staff, as well as income disclosures, show that at least one of his staffers appeared to be employed by the fund and the congressman at the same time. though the earnings were as light as $1k per month, there are still clear ethics violations that have to be investigated.evidence also shows that grayson has used taxpayer funds to manage the fund from abroad and possibly to solicit new investors to the fund, a charge he vehemently denies. while on a trip to tampa to present a proposal for increases to social security in august 2015, grayson reportedly scuttled his agenda to manage the hedge fund as markets bottomed out across the globe because of turmoil in china.what this all spells is big trouble for alan grayson. he s convinced that the dnc is working against him in a bid to see another democrat elected to the senate seat being vacated by marco rubio. unfortunately, the most disturbing news about grayson and his hedge fund comes from his own brochures and admissions, where he asserts that the philosophy of the fund is to invest in low-cost markets where political turmoil, civil unrest, war, famine and  blood in the streets  offers unique opportunities when the area rebuilds.his funds have all but failed, and his investors have all been paid back what they have lost, making him quite possibly the most decent of congressional rule-breakers, but a rule breaker nonetheless.",1
" kansas governor sam brownback on thursday signed into law a school funding bill that will face scrutiny by the state supreme court to determine if it fulfills a mandate for adequacy. the republican governor said he approved the measure even though the legislature “missed an opportunity to substantially improve the k 12 funding system.” the republican controlled legislature faced a june 30 deadline set by the kansas supreme court in march to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitution’s requirement for adequacy. alan rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed. “we’re grateful for the effort, but it’s not enough to achieve constitutionality,” he said, noting that the kansas state board of education had proposed an $893 million, two year funding increase. now that the bill has become law, rupe said he expects the supreme court to set up a process for the state to demonstrate how the measure complies with the constitutional requirement.  besides finding more money for schools, kansas lawmakers also had to plug budget holes largely caused by falling tax revenue. earlier this month, the legislature overrode brownback’s veto of a bill hiking income tax rates to raise $1.2 billion over the next two fiscal years.

" rick santorum withdrew from the race for the u.s. republican presidential nomination on wednesday and said he would endorse senator marco rubio in the race for the white house. santorum, a 57 year old former u.s. senator from pennsylvania, won the iowa caucuses four years ago but managed only 1 percent of the vote in the iowa contest on monday. santorum, in an appearance on fox news announcing his withdrawal and endorsement of rubio, called the florida senator “a tremendously gifted young man and ... a born leader.” he said rubio “can bring this country together, not just moderates and conservatives but young and old.” rubio, 44, finished third in monday’s iowa caucuses, the first contest in the state by state battle to decide who will be the republican nominee in the november presidential election. u.s. senator ted cruz of texas finished first in iowa, putting a dent in real estate tycoon donald trump’s standing as the republican front runner. santorum’s withdrawal leaves nine republican candidates in the 2016 white house race, with the next contest in new hampshire on tuesday. u.s. senator rand paul of kentucky announced earlier on wednesday he was suspending his campaign after a fifth place finish in iowa.  a favorite of the christian right, santorum announced his white house bid in may with an eye on economic issues. he campaigned on a promise to boost the middle class,eliminate the internal revenue service and crack down on illegalimmigration. santorum won a reputation as a strong social conservative in congress, where he opposed same sex marriage and the teaching of evolution in schools.

" president barack obama on sunday described the worst mass shooting in u.s. history as “an act of terror” and “an act of hate,” saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in orlando, florida was an attack on all americans. “today as americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,” he said in a statement at the white house.  “although it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” obama said. “we will not give in to fear or turn against each other. instead, we will stand united as americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.” he ordered the flag at the white house to be flown at half staff to honor the victims.  the shooter, who was identified as florida resident omar s. mateen was killed by police at the nightclub. a top u.s. congressman said mateen may have pledged allegiance to the islamic state militant group, but u.s. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection.   fifty three people were wounded in the rampage, which surpassed the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at virginia tech university. obama said it was appropriate for the fbi to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would “spare no effort” to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group. the president also termed the shooting a new reminder of “how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub,” a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent u.s. history.  “we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be,” he said.

" the governor of kansas on thursday vetoed a bill expanding eligibility for medicaid for the poor under the federal affordable care act (aca) because the measure was not fiscally responsible and would still fund planned parenthood. state lawmakers in the republican controlled senate voted in favor of the measure on tuesday, just days after president donald trump’s efforts to repeal and replace the aca, also known as obamacare, ended with the bill being pulled from a vote. republican governor sam brownback said the bill also failed to eliminate waiting lists for disability services, did not add work requirements and was not budget neutral. “the cost of expanding medicaid under obamacare is irresponsible and unsustainable,” he said.  he added it was “unwise to undertake such a drastic change” to the state’s medicaid program while work on an aca overhaul was underway in washington. “i will not support this legislation that continues to fund organizations that undermine a culture of life,” he said, referring to groups such as planned parenthood, which provides a range of reproductive services including abortions. planned parenthood said in a statement that “the overwhelming majority of kansans” support the health care provider and the expansion of medicaid in the state.  the republican controlled house, which passed the bill last month 81 44, quickly took up a debate on overriding brownback’s veto on thursday, but a vote was postponed. “you are going to put a dagger right through the heart of our small communities,” republican representative leonard mastroni, who voted in support of expansion, told the house in topeka after brownback’s veto.  in the house, 84 lawmakers would need to vote in favor of the override for it to advance. the failed obamacare replacement bill in washington, pushed by house speaker paul ryan, would have ended the aca’s expansion of medicaid, the federal and state funded insurance program for the poor and disabled. kansas was not among the 31 states that in 2016 had opted to expand medicaid, with the federal government footing much of the cost under obamacare. with the aca’s enhanced federal funding, medicaid expansion in kansas, effective jan. 1, 2018, would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins july 1, and $67 million in fiscal 2019 with more than 180,000 additional recipients, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill. without enhanced federal matching funds, the state’s costs would balloon to $465 million by fiscal 2019.

" the rollout of a tax cut plan being promoted by u.s. president donald trump and senior congressional republicans was delayed on wednesday as groups of lawmakers and special interests dug in on key provisions, insisting on changes. here are some of the most contentious issues in the tax debate, which likely will play out over the coming weeks and months before it can garner enough support to pass congress and be sent to trump to sign into law. 401(k). republicans are eyeing new limits on how much money americans can pump each year into their 401(k) retirement accounts on a pre tax basis. lower limits for tax free contributions would produce new revenue to help republicans pay for tax cuts they have proposed for high income earners, corporations and wealthy families’ inheritances. taxpayers now can channel $18,000 of income tax free into 401(k)s. republican tax writers initially proposed lowering that cap to $2,400 and, after pushback, that number has been in flux. firms that manage 401(k) plans, wall street firms that execute trades for them and the 54 million americans who have 401(k) accounts could be hurt by such a change. mortgages. americans can now deduct mortgage interest from their incomes if they itemize deductions. the plan does not call for changing that directly but it does call for doubling the standard deduction, a separate tax return line that determines eligibility for itemizing. doubling that would mean fewer americans itemizing   and fewer deducting mortgage interest. critics say doubling the standard deduction would make the mortgage interest deduction a benefit for only higher income taxpayers. the national association of home builders has declared opposition to the republican plan and proposed creating a new, non itemized tax credit for mortgage interest. salt. a proposal to eliminate a popular tax deduction for state and local tax (salt) payments has threatened to derail the republican plan. democratic and republican lawmakers from high tax states, such as new york, california and new jersey, oppose this change because it would hit their constituents hardest. real estate interests have fought for an exemption of state and local property taxes, which is expected to make it into the bill, with a cap. some salt state republicans say they would be satisfied with an adequate property tax deduction; others have said they will push to preserve income tax deductibility. pass throughs. republicans want to cut the tax rate for “pass through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 25 percent from as high as 39.6 percent. winners from this would include many pass throughs that are small mom and pop businesses but it would also benefit big enterprises, such as hedge funds and real estate partnerships. losers would be upper middle class wage earners unable to channel their incomes through pass through structures. some tax experts warn slashing the pass through rate could unleash new tax dodging schemes to enable americans to do just that: run their personal incomes through pass through structures such as partnerships, corporations and sole proprietorships. tax negotiators are examining ways to limit what types of professional partnerships would qualify for a new pass through rate. they also are weighing a proposal to limit the new rate to only 30 percent of business income. business interest. another change being evaluated by republicans is ending or further restricting tax deductibility of business interest. this would mean business borrowers could no longer write off the interest they pay on debts. businesses have formed a group, called the build coalition, to oppose the provision. members include abbott laboratories (abt.n), owens illinois (oi.n), s&p global (spgi.n) and lobbying groups for private equity firms, farmers, mortgage bankers, real estate investment trusts, casinos and equipment leasing groups. tax writers are looking at ways to exempt small businesses and allow them to continue to deduct business interest on debts. deficit. not long ago, most republicans stood firmly against increasing the federal budget deficit and the national debt but analysts say their tax plan would hugely expand both. washington was expected to collect $3.3 trillion in taxes in 2017 but spend $4 trillion, leaving a deficit of $700 billion. previous deficits have piled up a national debt of $20 trillion. the trump tax cut plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years and by $3.4 trillion in the 10 years after that, adding greatly to the deficit and the debt, according to the tax policy center, a non partisan think tank. the plan would give a small economic boost but soon be overwhelmed by the rising federal debt burden, the center said. helping the rich. the tax plan has struggled since it was unveiled as a rough framework in september with criticism from democrats and social activists, who say it is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations that hurts or neglects others. on that issue, the tax policy center study said, “in 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts.” ",0
" u.s. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on monday his party would look at “every single option” to halt a last ditch effort by republicans to repeal and replace former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. “we’re going to explore every single option,” schumer told a news conference to underscore democratic opposition to a bill introduced by republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy that proposes replacing the 2010 affordable care act. republicans face a two week countdown before senate procedural rules make it much harder for them to advance their latest bill.

" emperor akihito will hand over all public duties to his heir  after retiring in what will be japan s first abdication in nearly two centuries, the monarch s younger son said, responding to worries a former emperor might weaken his successor s status. japan s constitution defines the emperor as a symbol of the state and the people, without political power. his duties include shinto religious ceremonies and constitutionally defined tasks, such as the opening of parliament. the octogenarian akihito s 29 year reign has also been marked by travels to domestic disaster sites to cheer survivors, and overseas to soothe the wounds of a war fought in the name of his father, emperor hirohito, who was considered divine until japan s defeat in world war two. some experts, recalling past examples when ex emperors kept their influence, had feared the former monarch s existence would undercut the symbolic status of his heir, crown prince naruhito.  the emperor all along has intended to pass all his public duties including state acts to the next emperor,  naruhito s younger brother, prince akishino, said in remarks published to mark his 52nd birthday on thursday.  even if there are concerns about  dual authority , if that expression is appropriate, i can clearly say that it is impossible,  he added. a law enacted in june allows akihito, who turns 84 on dec. 23, to step down, but details have yet to be worked out. a special panel will discuss possible dates on friday, with the cabinet to make a final decision. the abdication is expected to take place in 2019. akihito, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare remarks last year that he feared age might make it hard to fulfill his duties. akishino, who is next in line to the throne after the 57 year old naruhito, said he wanted his father to rest after retiring.  i hope the emperor will spend relaxing time as much as possible after the abdication,  he said. akishino said he was willing to take on the crown prince s duties as much as possible after naruhito ascends the throne but would need to consult his older brother.   this is unprecedented, so there are many things i can not imagine,  he said. akishino s 11 year old son, prince hisahito, is the emperor s only grandson and will be second in line to the throne after the abdication. naruhito s daughter, princess aiko, who turns 16 on friday, cannot inherit the males only throne.

" a settlement with u.s. regulators gives volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de) too much authority over how to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle technology, a u.s. congresswoman from california said this week in a letter, echoing concerns from states and others who fear the german automaker gains undue influence in the deal. volkswagen agreed to spend $1.2 billion nationally and $800 million more in california on electric vehicle technology as penalties for equipping hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles sold in the united states with software designed to cheat tailpipe emissions tests. the letter from representative anne eshoo comes ahead of an oct. 18 hearing at which a federal judge will consider whether to give final approval to $15.3 billion in settlements for owners, state and federal regulators or require changes and renegotiation. a provision “of particular concern” allows vw to make “possible investments in its own proprietary technology and subsidiaries,” eshoo, a democrat, said in the oct. 4 letter to environmental protection agency (epa) administrator lisa mccarthy. the epa declined to comment. vw was not immediately available for comment. it has urged the court approve the deal. eshoo’s fears mirror those raised by electric car charging station companies in august. four members of the california state legislature, in comments to the u.s. department of justice, also urged independent oversight and administration of the vw funds “to ensure that multiple vendors with cutting edge technology are able to enter the market.”  the justice department said last month it received 1,195 comments period from private citizens, state and local government offices and agencies, businesses, and institutions and associations. the doj urged the agreements be approved with only minor changes.  objectors face an uphill battle since u.s. courts generally give the government significant latitude to negotiate settlements.  the justice department said nearly half of the comments were submitted on behalf of a company that provides truck stop electrification services to long haul truck drivers, idleair, urging that the vw program be allowed to fund such projects.

" a majority of americans say democrat hillary clinton won monday night’s presidential debate, but her performance doesn’t appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters, according to a reuters/ipsos national tracking poll released on wednesday.  the online poll, which gathered responses from more than 2,000 people on tuesday, found 56 percent of american adults felt that clinton did a better job than trump in the first of their three televised debates, compared with 26 percent who felt that trump did better.  of those who thought clinton emerged the victor, 85 percent were democrats and 22 percent were republicans.  u.s. presidential debates have historically been seen as a crucial test of candidates’ poise and policies. monday’s was watched by a record 84 million viewers and was billed as a rare prime time opportunity for two unpopular candidates to convince millions of undecided voters to back them.  afterward, both candidates claimed victory.  ““every single online poll had me winning,” trump said at a campaign stop in council bluffs, iowa on wednesday. “you sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate. i don’t think she did well at all.”  clinton campaign spokesman jesse ferguson said the democrat clearly won the debate as trump “was unprepared, became unhinged and was incoherent throughout.”  among those who are expected to take part in the nov. 8 general election, 34 percent said they felt that the debate changed their view of clinton in a positive way, compared with 19 percent who said the same of trump.  some 31 percent of likely voters said the debate improved clinton’s chances of winning the white house, while 16 percent said the debate benefited trump.  even so, clinton’s performance seemed to have little impact on her support among america’s likely voters. the poll showed 42 percent supported clinton while 38 percent supported trump. over the past few weeks clinton has maintained a lead of between 4 and 6 points over trump.  narrowing the focus to likely voters who watched the debate, clinton led trump 44 percent to 39 percent.  one possible reason for the lack of movement in her support is that it usually takes several days to measure the full impact of a single event, like a debate, said donald green, a political scientist at columbia university.  the reuters/ipsos poll is conducted every day in english in all 50 states. monday’s sample of 2,036 american adults included 1,336 people who were considered to be likely voters from their voting record, registration status and stated intention to vote in the election. among those likely voters, 1,026 said they watched some portion of the debate on live tv, online or in media clips that were circulated after the debate.  the poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and the sample of likely voters. it has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points for the likely voters who watched the debate.  national opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for clinton and trump. some polls, like reuters/ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. the reuters/ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that clinton’s lead over trump has been shrinking this month to about 2 percentage points.

" virginia governor terry mcauliffe signed an order on friday restoring the voting rights of more than 200,000 convicted felons who have completed their sentences, in a move that could help the democratic nominee in november’s presidential election. by using his executive powers, the democratic governor is circumventing the republican majority in the state general assembly. many of the convicts affected by the order are african americans or latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for democratic candidates in the past.  “virginia will no longer build walls and barriers to the ballot box   we will break them down,” mcauliffe said in a message on his twitter account. advocates of restoring voting rights say it is a way of promoting racial justice, as african americans are convicted of crimes and sent to prison at about twice the rate of the overall u.s. population. stephen j. farnsworth, a political analyst at the university of mary washington in fredericksburg, said a majority of the convicted felons who regained their voting rights were likely members of minority groups. of the 5.8 million americans banned from voting, 2.2 million are african american, according to the sentencing project, a prison reform advocacy group. in three states   virginia, florida and kentucky   more than a fifth of black residents outside of prison are barred from voting. about 13 percent of the u.s. population is african american. mcauliffe’s order drew immediate criticism from john whitbeck, chairman of the republican party of virginia, who said the governor should have excluded those convicted of violent crimes. “his decision to issue a blanket restoration, without regard to the nature of the crimes committed doesn’t speak of mercy. rather, it speaks of political opportunism,” whitbeck said in a statement.  nationwide, restoration of voting rights is an issue that has drawn support from both democrats and republicans as a way to improve reintegration of prisoners into society. about two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades, according to the sentencing project. but the move carries political implications as well. virginia is considered a key swing state in the 2016 election, and the governor’s order could tip the balance in favor of the democratic candidate who wins the party’s nomination. while democrat barack obama took virginia both in the 2008 and 2012 elections, republican presidential candidates have a history of dominance in the state. before obama’s victories, republicans carried virginia in every presidential election since 1952 except one. in 1964, democrat lyndon johnson won in virginia as he defeated barry goldwater in a national landslide. the governor, who said on friday virginia has had some of the most restrictive laws in the country for restoration of voting and civil rights, has made the issue a high priority during his administration. previous efforts have resulted in the restoration of voting rights to 18,000 virginians, he said. the order will restore the rights of every virginia felon who completed his or her sentence and all other requirements as of april 22, affecting 206,000 people immediately, the governor said in a press release.  before the order, virginia felons would have to petition the governor, who had broad discretion in ruling on any request.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump faulted the muslim community on monday for not reporting people like the man who carried out the orlando gay nightclub attack, killing 49 people and wounding 53 others. trump, the presumptive republican nominee for president, told cnn he thought orlando nightclub shooter omar mateen was known to people in the muslim community as someone with a potential for violence. “you will find that many people that knew him felt that he was a whack job ... (that) something like this would have happened,” trump told cnn in a phone interview. “people that knew him, the ex wife, other people. they don’t report them. for some reason the muslim community does not report people like this.”  trump said the united states needed better intelligence gathering to prevent such things from happening. “we have to look at the mosques ... and we have to look at the community,” he said. “and believe me, the community knows the people that have the potential to blow up.” ",0
" canadian and u.s. officials are working on a plan to tackle asylum seekers crossing into canada illegally, with american officials keen to discover how they entered the united states in the first place, said a source familiar with the matter. u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly is set to visit canada this month for talks on the border and the influx of people, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. hundreds of people, mainly from africa but also the middle east, have walked across the border, seeking asylum. they are fleeing president donald trump’s crackdown on illegal immigrants, migrants and refugees agencies say. it is not common to have so many asylum seekers based in the u.s. looking for refuge in canada over such a short period. scott bardsley, a spokesman for public safety minister ralph goodale, said the majority of people crossing in recent weeks held valid passports and u.s. visas. the influx poses a political risk for prime minister justin trudeau, who faces pressure from the left, which wants him to let more in, and from the right, which fears an increased security risk. he must also ensure the issue does not complicate his relations with trump.  “we are talking with our counterparts in the united states to ensure that we’re addressing this situation properly,” trudeau told reporters in calgary, alberta. security experts have said the asylum seekers could pose a threat if the flow picks up once the weather improves and authorities do not take additional steps. canadian and u.s. officials speak daily about the border crossers and law enforcement agencies from both nations met in montreal last month to plot strategies, the source said. the u.s. side asked canada to provide details of the asylum seekers, in particular, how they had entered the united states and what their status was there.  the montreal summit grouped representatives from the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp), the canada border services agency, the u.s. department of homeland security and the u.s. customs and border protection agency. rcmp spokeswoman annie delisle confirmed the meeting took place, and said the two sides agreed on an “action plan which outlines a collaborative approach to dealing with the influx”.  an official in the u.s. department of homeland security said the crossings were very limited and did not represent a major security concern. “frankly, it is far more embarrassing to this country than it is threatening,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  the official, and a second person directly involved in border affairs, said u.s. authorities had not mounted a major effort to beef up border security, in part because they lack manpower and equipment. a senior canadian security source classified the risk as medium  to long term, since it was likely that those crossing the border really were seeking asylum. vast stretches of the 5,500 mile (8,900 km) frontier are unguarded and the more images spread of people walking across, the more vulnerable canada could become, said the source. “if we keep this up for a while, and it becomes known that the border really is porous, then people will use it as an opportunity to put (operatives) in,” said the source. exact numbers are hard to calculate, since not all authorities release details. in january and february, 143 people walked illegally over the border into manitoba, local police said. as of feb. 13, some 3,800 people had made an asylum claim in 2017, up from the same period last year, said bardsley. that number, though, includes all people seeking asylum, and the government would not break down the figures.

" french voters view far leftist jean luc melenchon as the strongest opponent of president emmanuel macron, according to a new poll on tuesday that highlights the weakness of mainstream opposition. the ifop fiducial poll showed macron s popularity has dropped sharply since he took power in may but its key finding could help him as he embarks on reforms because polls show voters see melenchon as too extreme to be a serious candidate for power.  melenchon is very much on the protest front but not seen as an actual alternative (to macron),  said frederic dab of ifop pollsters.   that can be an opportunity for emmanuel macron, allowing him to create a vacuum around him and replace the left right divide by a reform vs protest debate.  the poll for paris match and sud radio showed 45 percent of voters say melenchon s  france unbowed  party provides the strongest opposition to macron. that is more than twice the figure for the conservative republicans (lr) or the far right national front (fn). only 8 percent mentioned the socialists. france unbowed has been much more vocal than the conservatives or socialists. the republicans have been subdued in the wake of their defeat in the presidential election and divided over what stance to take toward macron, whose economic policies resemble what many in their party have asked for for years. all three parties are struggling to get their voices heard above macron and melenchon s criticism of each other.  macron is trying to eliminate anything there is between him and extreme parties. i won t let him do that ... i won t resign myself to melenchon being the only opposition to macron,  laurent wauquiez, the frontrunner to win lr s leadership in december, said on sunday.  a government source said melenchon s relative strength was welcome and he was macron s only proper opponent.   i was praying to have jean luc melenchon and marine le pen in parliament ... the emmanuel macron/edouard philippe alliance was meant to get the socialist party and the right to explode and we are not disappointed,  the source said. he was referring to the fact that macron s prime minister philippe comes from lr.     melenchon strongly opposes macron s plans to overhaul labor laws but his party can do little to block the measures because it has just 17 lawmakers in the 577 strong parliament. melenchon, an anti nato euroskeptic known for his fiery debating style, has called on his supporters to march on sept. 23 to protest the labor reforms, which will give companies more flexibility on firings, pay and working hours. the poll confirmed macron s drop in popularity with 46 percent saying they approved of his policies, down 10 points from july.

" a pakistani anti corruption court on thursday indicted ousted prime minister nawaz sharif and his daughter over allegations linked to ownership of london properties, opening a trial that could see the former leader jailed. the sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable.  sharif, 67, resigned in july after the supreme court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling pakistan muslim league nawaz (pml n) party. sharif said there was no precedent for indicting someone in his absence.  i hope i will get justice,  he told reporters in london in remarks broadcast by local geo tv, adding that he would travel home to attend the next court hearing.  judge bashir ahmad of the court that tries cases registered and investigated by an anti graft body, the national accountability bureau (nab), indicted sharif, his daughter maryam sharif and her husband, muhammad safdar. they all pleaded not guilty.  maryam and safdar were present in court, but sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, sent a representative while he tends to his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment in britain.  maryam said in the court that the charges were unfounded and baseless.  this will go down in history as a travesty of justice,  she said. outside the court, maryam again hinted at military interference in the judicial process by saying the trial was  a repeat of 1999 , the year her father was toppled in a military coup led by former army chief pervez musharraf. it is not clear if she was comparing the trial to the coup, or subsequent corruption accusations and investigations that musharraf ordered into sharif. sharif s disqualification stemmed from the panama papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the british virgin islands and used them to buy posh flats in london. the supreme court initially declined to dismiss sharif but ordered an investigation into his family s wealth.  a separate supreme court appointed panel said the family s wealth did not match its income, and accused maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy the london flats.  after the probe, the top court disqualified sharif and ordered the nab to investigate and conduct a trial. sharif denies ever receiving the small source of income that led to his disqualification.  the nab has in the past been described as toothless because of its low conviction rates, especially when it comes to powerful politicians, and investigations that last many years. but the supreme court has ordered the trial to be concluded within six months.    opening arguments are due to begin on oct. 26.

" republican presidential candidate marco rubio has picked devon energy corp co founder larry nichols to help oversee his campaign’s stance on energy issues, rubio spokesman jahan wilcox said on monday.     rubio, a u.s. senator from florida, made the choice as his campaign efforts move toward the next round of primary voting states, including nevada on tuesday and then oklahoma and texas on march 1, “super tuesday.”      nichols, who stepped down as devon’s ceo in 2012 after more than 30 years but stayed on executive chairman, is set to fully retire this year from the oklahoma based oil producer. like other powerful voices in the oil and gas industry, nichols last year echoed calls to lift a 40 year old federal ban on crude oil exports. nichols is set to host a feb. 26 fundraiser for rubio in oklahoma, a key u.s. energy state and home to significant horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and in december donated $50,000 to the super pac supporting rubio, according to bloomberg news. nichols, 73, is active in several industry groups, including america’s natural gas alliance, the national association of manufacturers, the business industry political action committee, and the american petroleum institute, according to devon’s website. he also previously led the american exploration & production council. before his work in the energy sector, nichols worked as a special assistant in the u.s. department of justice, the company’s website said. rubio is battling to be the republican nominee for the nov. 8 presidential election alongside front runner and real estate tycoon donald trump and fellow u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, a key oil state. ohio governor john kasich and retired neurosurgeon ben carson are also seeking the republican nomination.

" the commodity futures trading commission would have stronger policing powers over the derivatives market, along with a boosted budget, under legislation introduced in the u.s. congress on wednesday. the bill, introduced by democrats elizabeth warren and mark warner in the senate and elijah cummings in the house of representatives, also would add new tasks to the regulator’s rulemaking agenda. “the only way to make sure that derivatives can never lead to a financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts again is to put in place clearer rules and stronger oversight,” warren said in a statement.  the bill likely will fizzle in the republican led congress. it could also become part of this year’s election fights, as the relationship between wall street and washington frequently moves to center stage in presidential and congressional campaigns.   democrats such as warren, who is campaigning for her party’s presumptive nominee, hillary clinton, regard the dodd frank wall street reform law passed after the 2007 09 financial crisis as crucial for preventing another massive meltdown. that law greatly expanded the cftc’s reach, as swaps and derivatives had played a key role in the breakdown of banks and other firms. they also seek further regulation, saying vulnerabilities persist in the financial system. the presumptive nominee for the republican party, real estate developer and television star donald trump wants to repeal dodd frank. many in the party say the law has gone too far, drying up liquidity and freezing capital. the proposed legislation “gives the cftc a stable funding stream and the tools necessary to help deter future illegal acts by permitting penalties large enough to impact the bottom lines of even the largest financial firms,” cummings said. the cftc currently is funded through annual appropriations from congress, unlike the securities and exchange commission, which is backed by user fees and fines.  cftc chair timothy massad has sought a change, saying millions of dollars more in funds would help the agency keep up with technology advancements in the markets it oversees and with “high powered defense teams” in its enforcement cases. republicans in congress say the funding process keeps the agency accountable to elected leaders. the democrats’ bill would move the cftc to the same model as the sec. it would also put certain foreign exchange swaps under cftc jurisdiction, change how derivatives are treated in bankruptcy, require posting initial margin in inter affiliate swaps, and require regulators to review derivatives clearinghouses.

" north korea called on friday for a halt to what it called “brutal sanctions”, saying the measures   imposed after its latest nuclear test   constituted genocide. “today the u.s. led racket of brutal sanctions and pressure against the dprk constitutes contemporary human rights violation and genocide,” the north korean mission to the united nations in geneva said in a statement. the sanctions regime “threatens and impedes the enjoyment by the people of dprk of their human rights in all sectors”, it said. the call for an immediate end to the sanctions comes as u.s. president donald trump sets off on a trip to asia   including china, south korea and japan   looking for help to pressure north korea to stand down from the nuclear crisis.  the global community has been ramping up the pressure on the isolated country after it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, on sept. 3.  last month the united states unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven north korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses, including forced labor. in september the u.n. security council strengthened its sanctions, including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials, north korea’s response follows a u.n. expert last month saying international sanctions may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of pyongyang’s citizens. the sanctions meant that “some unprincipled countries have blocked the delivery of medical equipment and medicines”, the north korean mission said on friday, with the supplies destined for children and mothers in the country. “all types of anti human rights and inhumane sanctions against the dprk should be terminated immediately and thoroughly,” it said.

" fifty prominent republican national security officials, including a former cia director, on monday called party nominee donald trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be “the most reckless president in american history.” the statement was the latest repudiation of trump’s candidacy by veteran republican national security specialists, and was remarkable for the harshness of its language. “mr. trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. he weakens u.s. moral authority as the leader of the free world. he appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the u.s. constitution, u.s. laws and u.s. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,” the statement said. “none of us will vote for donald trump,” said the statement, which noted that some signatories also have doubts about democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. “from a foreign policy perspective, donald trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief,” said the statement, which was first reported in the new york times. “indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country’s national security and well being.” the signatories, some of whom worked for more than one republican president, included former central intelligence agency director michael hayden, who also headed the national security agency; former homeland security secretary michael chertoff; former director of national intelligence john negroponte; and two former u.s. trade representatives, carla hills and robert zoelick. other signatories included former senior state department, pentagon and national security council officials who helped plan and oversee the 2003 u.s. invasion of iraq. trump has harshly criticized the iraq operation, although when radio host howard stern asked him in 2002 if he favored invading iraq, trump said he guessed he did. the statement was organized by philip zelikow, who served as a top adviser to former secretary of state condoleezza rice. trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of “the failed washington elite” who “deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.” “these insiders – along with hillary clinton – are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade iraq, allow americans to die in benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of isis,” he continued, using an acronym for the islamic state militant group. the statement did not cite specific comments by trump, but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for nato, expressing admiration for russian president vladimir putin, calling for a temporary ban on immigration by muslims, and inviting russia to hack clinton’s private email server   which he later said was a joke. many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing trump’s national security qualifications that was published in march. the statement said many americans are frustrated with the federal government’s failure to solve domestic and international problems. “but donald trump is not the answer to america’s daunting challenges and to this crucial election,” the statement said. “we are convinced that in the oval office, he would be the most reckless president in american history. some democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the new york real estate developer’s nomination has sown within the republican party. “this letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party – many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to trump,” said brian katulis, a fellow at the center for american progress and a clinton campaign adviser. “calling trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough, but also asserting that he’s lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing,” said tommy vietor, a former national security council spokesman in democratic president barack obama’s administration. “that said, i think it’s unlikely to influence many voters, but it could give cover to republican members of congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from trump.” (for the complete statement go to: here) ",0
" the top democrats on the u.s. senate and house of representatives intelligence committees accused russia on thursday of trying to influence the nov. 8 u.s. election via computer hacking, and called on president vladimir putin to order a halt. “based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election,” senator dianne feinstein and representative adam schiff said in an unusually strongly worded joint statement. officials in the administration of president barack obama have said they concluded that russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organizations. the government has not publicly blamed russia. russia has denied it sponsors or encourages any hacking activity. the lawmakers said the russian effort was intended to sow doubt about the security of the u.s. election, and that the orders for intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from “very senior levels” of the moscow government. “we call on president putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. we hope all americans will stand together and reject the russian effort,” the statement said. u.s. relations with russia have had a high profile in campaigning for the nov. 8 election, in which the white house, one third of the senate seats and all the house seats are up for grabs. donald trump, the republican presidential nominee, has been criticized by democrats   and some republicans   for his praise of putin.

" alabama governor robert bentley said on thursday he would not resign after the state’s ethics commission found probable cause that he violated ethics and campaign finance laws, a ruling that could result in criminal charges. the second term republican governor faces a hearing in separate proceedings on monday that could lead to his eventual impeachment and ouster. the probable cause findings by the alabama ethics commission prompted republican del marsh, the leader of the state senate, to call on bentley to step down, local media reported. marsh said the governor was not able to lead effectively. bentley faces escalating political fallout over his relationship with a former senior adviser and has been dogged for the past year by questions concerning his potentially inappropriate use of state resources. asked for a response to marsh’s comments, bentley said in a statement: “i have no intentions of resigning and i am looking forward to continuing to work on important issues facing the state.” the alabama house of representatives’ judiciary committee will begin the impeachment process on monday, said its chairman, representative mike jones. “it’s time to put this in front of us, let’s address it, and let’s get it behind us,” jones said on the floor of the house on thursday. the committee will make a recommendation to the full house on whether to impeach bentley. the judiciary committee has been conducting its own investigation apart from the ethics commission and plans to issue a report on friday. bentley denies any legal wrongdoing. “we think there is not a basis that the governor violated any law,” his lawyer, bill athanas, told reporters wednesday night. “so the battle goes on.” after allegations of a scandal broke last year, bentley apologized for making inappropriate remarks to married staffer rebekah mason, while denying allegations of a physical affair. mason resigned as questions about the pair’s relationship began to dominate alabama politics. bentley’s wife filed for divorce in august 2015 after 50 years of marriage, citing unspecified problems. local media said the ethics commission found probable cause that bentley violated state campaign regulations by accepting a contribution and making a loan to his campaign outside the time frame permitted by law and using campaign funds to pay mason’s legal fees. he also may have violated ethics law by using public resources for his personal interest. if charged with breaking alabama’s ethics or campaign finance laws, bentley could 20 years in prison per violation, the commission said.

" bulgaria has frozen assets and property and bank accounts belonging to businessman and media owner ivo prokopiev, who said the state was trying to silence the country s independent media.     the commission for illegal assets forfeiture is preparing to file a claim against prokopiev and his businesses to seize assets and property worth 199 million levs ($119 million), which it believed were derived from a rogue privatization of a plant 17 years ago, said the commission s chairman, plamen georgiev. bulgaria, one of the european union s poorest and, according to transparency international, its most corrupt country, set up the commission in the 2000s to confiscate the  illegally obtained assets of corrupt businessmen and officials and organized crime bosses. prokopiev, 46, denied any wrongdoing. he said the commission has been used to intimidate the journalists at the influential financial newspaper capital and the news website dnevnik. he is the majority owner of both.  he also said a bulgarian court had ruled in 2004 that nothing was wrong with the privatization of mineral maker kaolin, the basis of the accusations against him.       we are witnessing how a state institution with very wide powers is being used as a bat and an instrument for repression,  prokopiev told a news conference.   we do not have any doubt about the ultimate goal of this .... to subdue the editorial position of two of the few independent media in bulgaria.  georgiev told a news conference a regional court in bulgaria had frozen shares and stakes of prokopiev in over 40 companies on commission s request, but said the actions would not impede the work of the news organizations. five right wing political parties that are not represented in the parliament protested against the commission s move. some political analysts also saw it as an attempt to silence the independent newspapers in the country.   this act really seems to be directed against people who are representatives of free media in bulgaria, said daniel smilov, an analyst with sofia based center for liberal strategies. bulgaria ranked 109th out of 180 countries, lower than any eu member, in the 2017 world press freedom index compiled by the paris based organization reporters without borders. bulgaria ranked 51st in 2007, when it joined the eu.

" leading democrats are growing increasingly worried that the hackers who made public leaked documents this week were trying  to sabotage the democratic candidates in several central florida congressional races, the first time such leaks have been targeted so directly. two sources familiar with democratic party investigations of  recent cyber attacks said documents made public this week by the hacker known as guccifer2 contained information that could damage democratic candidates in competitive florida contests for the u.s. house of representatives. the documents, hacked from the democratic congressional campaign committee (dccc), which raises funds for the party’s house candidates, are detailed dossiers describing the florida candidates’ backgrounds, including personal details, as well as political, economic and demographic profiles of the strategic congressional districts. since 1996, the parties winning the counties in the interstate 4 corridor between orlando and tampa, where several of the targeted districts are located, have won the presidency. many of the state’s moderate swing voters live in the i 4 corridor, and if republican voters there turn out in force, it could cut into the vote for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton.the dccc was one of several democratic party organizations, including the democratic national committee (dnc) and hillary clinton’s presidential campaign, that have been hacked, but the democratic party sources said they did not know who might have helped the hackers select the florida races to target, or what the hackers were trying to accomplish. there is, though, a growing pattern of attacks on the data systems of u.s. political organizations by hackers whom u.s. intelligence officials and private cyber security firms have concluded are working for or with russian intelligence agencies.  donald trump’s presidential campaign has hired consultants crowdstrike to bolster its data security. but two people familiar with attempts to breach the campaign and other republican organizations said that so far there was no indication of a penetration as serious as those of the democratic organizations, and crowdstrike is not investigating any successful hacking of trump campaign data.

" connecticut lawmakers on thursday passed a two year $41.3 billion budget, nearly four months after it was due, that is expected to help capital city hartford avoid bankruptcy through state aid provisions. the budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 closes a $3.5 billion deficit over the two years, in part with tax and fee hikes on tobacco products, ride shares and low income working families. it also raids a host of funds   for everything from school bus seats to clean energy and tobacco cessation   for money that will be swept into the general fund. the state senate passed the nearly 900 page legislation early on thursday morning, with the house following suit later in the day. it was not immediately clear whether governor dannel malloy, a democrat who has said he will not seek a third term in office, would sign it. he vetoed a previous budget a month ago. in a statement, malloy spokeswoman kelly donnelly said the governor and his staff would analyze the bill but had “uncovered egregious problems” with a tax increase on hospitals that could knock the budget more than $1 billion dollars out of balance. raising hospital taxes would allow the state to get more federal medicaid reimbursement, with the tax revenues to be returned to the hospitals.  “if there’s a problem, we’ll fix it,” said house minority leader themis klarides, a republican, about the hospital tax in a televised press conference after the vote. the budget contains aid for hartford, which has said it could file for bankruptcy without extra funding to help close its own $50 million shortfall. that funding would come with strings attached in the form of a fiscal oversight board.     connecticut’s towns, schools and nonprofit service providers have grappled for months with growing uncertainty as they wait for state funding that helps them operate. when the fiscal year began on july 1 without a budget, malloy took control of spending through an executive order and enacted steep cuts.

" the technician who helped manage hillary clinton’s private email server for her work as secretary of state has given security logs to investigators that he said show no signs of foreign hacking, the new york times reported on thursday. bryan pagliano is cooperating with the federal bureau of investigation’s criminal inquiry into the email setup in exchange for limited immunity by the u.s. department of justice, according to the times, citing unnamed people who know about the investigation. with limited immunity, his testimony cannot be used in a prosecution against him, the times said. the investigation has overshadowed hillary clinton’s campaign to become the democratic party’s candidate in the november presidential election. clinton has apologized for the arrangement but says she did nothing wrong and that she believes the government will vindicate her. pagliano, who helped set up and run the email system in clinton’s new york home, told investigators that the logs he handed over indicated that no intrusion occurred, the times said. the security logs show who accessed the server and when, though they may not capture more sophisticated hacking, the times said. pagliano was still working at the state department’s bureau of information resource management as recently as last september, but has since left, a department spokesman said on monday. the spokesman declined to say when he left or why. the federal bureau of investigation is doing its own analysis of whether the server was attacked, according to media reports. fbi agents plan to seek interviews with clinton’s aides in coming weeks and would like to interview clinton herself as their investigation enters a new phase, bloomberg news reported on thursday, citing two people familiar with the inquiry. the interviews would look into how the server was set up and used and what precautions were taken to protect sensitive data, according to the people, who described the matter on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, bloomberg news said. investigators were almost finished examining computers and other physical evidence as part of the inquiry, which is focused on whether clinton’s use of private email while serving as the nation’s top diplomat led to the improper handling of classified information, according to the people. pagliano previously worked on clinton’s failed 2008 presidential campaign, and ended up joining her at the state department in 2009 as a political appointee, working as a technology specialist and maintaining clinton’s email server. his employment ended with clinton in february 2013, but he stayed on as a contractor. more than 2,000 of clinton’s emails contain classified information that could harm national security if leaked, according to the state department. the government forbids sending or storing such information outside secure, government controlled channels, and has prosecuted people for breaches. the fbi and the justice department have declined to comment on their investigation, including who might be its target, beyond confirming its existence. pagliano’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. a clinton spokesman said the campaign is pleased that pagliano is cooperating, but declined to respond to questions. for more on the 2016 presidential race, see the reuters blog, “tales from the trail” (here).

" the u.s. senate moved on tuesday toward ramming through approval of president donald trump’s supreme court nominee this week, as its top republican said he had the votes to wipe away democratic roadblocks but vowed to preserve the minority party’s ability to hold up legislation. majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to change the senate’s long standing rules in order to eliminate the ability to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster against supreme court nominees like trump’s pick, neil gorsuch, if a democratic filibuster succeeds as expected in blocking a confirmation vote. senate confirmation of gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime post would restore the court’s conservative majority and enable trump to leave a lasting imprint on america’s highest judicial body even as he regularly criticizes the federal judiciary. mcconnell said he had the necessary votes to approve the rule change with a simple majority vote, expected on thursday. republicans control the senate 52 48. the rule change has been dubbed the “nuclear option,” and trump has encouraged mcconnell to “go nuclear.” such a step would threaten to further erode trust between the parties in congress. “there’s a reason they call it the nuclear option, and that is because there’s fallout. and this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the senate for years to come,” democratic senator richard blumenthal told reporters. republicans were so confident they could use their muscle to pass the rule change that senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley said flatly that gorsuch “will be on the supreme court friday night.” amid a fierce debate over both gorsuch and the senate’s rules, mcconnell tried to tamp down any speculation that republicans would stage a monumental power grab by ending the filibuster for legislation. mcconnell said that as long as he was the senate’s majority leader, he would never remove the ability to mount a filibuster against legislation, as opposed to presidential appointments. mcconnell fought against many of former democratic president barack obama’s legislative initiatives when republicans were the minority party in the senate. “there’s not a single senator in the (republican) majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster, not one,” mcconnell told reporters. the move to change venerable senate rules reflects an intensifying of the already toxic partisanship in washington since trump took office in january. mcconnell’s promise to keep the ability to filibuster legislation could make it more difficult for republicans to get key parts of trump’s legislative agenda through the senate, considering the expected strong democratic opposition. a filibuster requires a super majority of 60 votes in the 100 seat senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a supreme court nominee or legislation. the 60 vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. the senate on tuesday kicked off its formal debate on confirming gorsuch, a colorado based appeals court judge, and mcconnell said he would get the clock ticking toward a vote expected on thursday to stop the democrats’ filibuster. democrats on monday amassed the votes needed to sustain the filibuster, prompting republicans to move toward changing the rules. democratic senator jeff merkley took to the senate floor on tuesday evening to rally support for the gorsuch filibuster. his office said in a statement that he “plans to hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking.” merkley’s “talking filibuster” is not expected to affect the republican timetable for gorsuch’s confirmation.  the filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s. the democrats were the first to use the “nuclear option.” in 2013, when they controlled the senate, they changed it to bar filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices. they did so after republicans filibustered obama’s appeals court nominees. “democrats are now being pushed by far left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country,” mcconnell said on the senate floor. “they seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time, and trying to take the senate with them.” top senate democrat chuck schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said it was the republicans who bore responsibility for the crisis and for deciding, as he said, to “break the rules.” he noted that the senate, under mcconnell’s guidance, refused last year to consider obama’s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump elected gorsuch to fill. “what the majority leader did to merrick garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster,” schumer said on the senate floor. restoring the nine seat high court’s conservative majority would fulfill one of trump’s top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. republicans say gorsuch is well qualified for the job and that there is no principled reason to oppose him. democrats say he is so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, has favored corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions, and has shown insufficient independence from trump.

" both u.s. presidential candidates routinely criticize free trade deals they blame for the loss of american jobs. but tweaking the north american free trade agreement (nafta), as hillary clinton has pledged to do, or ripping it up, as donald trump demands, may do nothing to help companies like element electronics corp, which owns america’s last television factory.  winnsboro, south carolina based element, and the television industry more broadly, offer a window into the complexity of industrial supply chains and illustrate why pushing manufacturing jobs back to the united states is so difficult. element’s plant in south carolina is nearly identical to a rival factory operated by taiwanese conglomerate tatung company that sits on a dusty back street in this mexican border town. both import nearly all their components from asia. the parts often flow in through the same southern california ports. but there's a big, and costly, difference. the mexican plant, by sitting just over the border from el paso, texas, doesn't have to pay duty on those parts, even when the finished televisions are sold in the united states. but element's factory has to foot the tariff bill, which makes its televisions more expensive. (for a graphic on the trade loophole, click tmsnrt.rs/2ep5qmy ) “it’s pretty crazy that i’m disadvantaged for using u.s. labor,” says michael o’shaughnessy, element’s president. that’s a sentiment that trump, the republican nominee, has forcefully tapped as he makes the case that radically revamping the trade deal would level the playing field and bring jobs back. many trade experts, though, say it would be a costly disaster to try to unravel these production networks, which essentially treat mexico as a 51st state.  the peterson institute for international economics, a washington think tank that favors free trade, released a study last month that predicted imposing stiff tariffs on mexico and china would disrupt north american producers that have created global supply chains and push the united states into a recession. “the tv industry is characterized by particularly dense webs of cross border supply chains with mexico and china,” says marcus noland, the economist who directed the study. “there’d be chaos and a trade war.” even many who oppose nafta acknowledge it would be disruptive to suddenly erect barriers, given the way companies have shifted supply chains to integrate mexico. nafta, implemented in 1994, forged a common market between the united states, mexico and canada. in response, many industries, including television manufactures, have transformed themselves by creating supply chains that crisscross the border.  televisions once were produced in the united states and elsewhere with hundreds of parts, often tucked into elaborate wooden cases. a modern flat screen, by contrast, has relatively few parts, and more than 70 percent of its value is packed into the glass and the electronics integrated directly into the panel. the heart of the industry, including that core glass technology and production, is now based in asia. about half of all tvs imported to the u.s. come from mexico, says paul gagnon, an expert on the industry’s supply chain at ihs markit, an economic research firm.  “the main reason for that is so the producers can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand,” he says. tv sales are highly seasonal, spiking late in the year. in mexico, some of the factories double their workforce for just a few months to respond to this. gagnon doubts the jobs would come back to the united states, because margins on tvs are so low. “if there were any major cost increase (in mexico), you’d probably see some shift to asia for production — rather than seeing that production happen in the u.s.” some mexican plants mold the plastic casing and do other tasks in the assembly process. but in many cases — including at both the element and tatung plants — the assembly plants do mostly finishing touches like inserting printing circuit boards and tuning the units. this creates relatively few jobs compared to the kind of television manufacturing done in the u.s. industry’s heyday. in the 1950s, there were some 150 domestic television manufacturers in the united states, and employment peaked at about 100,000 in the 1960s. mexico’s cost advantage over the united state is formidable. o’shaughnessy said he pays his 200 workers, who operate in a converted shirt factory, about $15 an hour. the pay at the juarez plant is about $2.50 an hour. even with this edge, it’s getting harder to do the work in mexico, said chan hsing diao, manager of the tatung plant. (tatung doesn’t sell televisions under its own name, but rather is paid by other manufacturers to assemble their name brand products.) “the industry is consolidating and the cost pressures are enormous,” he said, noting that over the last six years, the amount he is paid to assemble a 32 inch television has fallen by half, from about $6 a unit to $3 a unit. “the profits are this,” he said, holding up two fingers almost touching. the tatung plant in juarez occupies a cavernous space that was once a windshield factory. it now features long assembly lines for televisions and produced 15 million tvs over the last seven years, diao said. some 13 million of those were sold in the united states. in january, the company lost its main customer, a chinese tv manufacturer that diao declined to identify. tatung is scrambling to find a new manufacturer that wants to build tvs for the united states. in the meantime, it continues assembling tvs for mexico and some other latin american markets. diao warned there would be a trade war if a new u.s. administration tore up the nafta agreement. with profits already so tight in mexico, many chinese producers might find it easier to ship finished goods directly from asia rather than move production and jobs to the united states, he said. o’shaughnessy, for his part, said he just wants to get the same break on import duties as mexico gets under nafta. his decision to build in the united states, he said, was driven entirely by his only customer for the u.s. plant, wal mart, which uses element as a centerpiece of its campaign to promote domestic manufacturing. the south carolina tvs are shipped in boxes emblazoned with american flags and bearing the words “assembled in the usa.” o’shaughnessy has appealed for a tariff exemption from his local congressman, rep. mick mulvaney, a republican. mulvaney said he is sympathetic but has been unable to win over many fellow lawmakers who consider special exemptions a form of earmarks for special interests, which many oppose on principle. “element makes clear the real world implications of these trade deals we have signed,” said mulvaney, adding that it’s time to “review” nafta to iron out this and other loopholes.    back in juarez, the annual ramp up of hiring is under way at the tatung plant to supply the surge of televisions bought over the holidays. employment at tatung goes as low as 280 each year, for instance, but is now on its way up to 600, diao said. “you could never do that in america — at least not easily,” he says, referring to this cycle of hiring and firing large numbers.

" mutual praise, warm handshakes and even an impromptu love song at a lavish dinner suggest u.s. president donald trump and philippine leader rodrigo duterte want a fresh start after the biggest breakdown in u.s. philippine ties in years. their meeting on monday during a summit of asian leaders in manila was arguably the most anticipated of the three day event and went off well, with duterte s aides talking up the rapport the two had, and trump boasting of his  great relationship  with the similarly mercurial philippines leader. it came a little over a year after duterte announced his  separation  from the united states and sought new alliances with china and russia. angered by barack obama s criticism of his war on drugs, he told the then u.s. president to  go to hell , shocking american businesses and a philippine military heavily reliant on the help of the pentagon. central to the rapprochement this week was duterte holding his tongue, and trump not expressing concern about duterte s centerpiece policy   the crackdown on drugs that has killed thousands of filipinos.  tensions and damage inflicted during the obama administration has somehow been repaired, looking at the executive relationship, it has essentially been normalized,  said richard javad heydarian, an author and a political science professor at manila s de la salle university.  the modus operandi is, trump doesn t openly criticize duterte s war on drugs and duterte tones down his direct attacks on the u.s.  even with trump in the white house, duterte had repeatedly railed at the  hypocrisy  of his country s former colonial ruler. he has accused washington of treating the philippines like a dog and said he would not visit the united states, because it was  lousy . but there was none of duterte s trademark hostility this week and some indications that both countries had taken a calibrated approach to ensure the two leaders hit it off. contrary to traditional seating protocol for a summit of the association of south east asian nations (asean), the two were seated next to each other at sunday s gala dinner. duterte sang a hit filipino love song at that event, and joked it was  on the orders of the u.s. commander in chief . although duterte s fallout with obama was acrimonious, the fissures between the two long term allies did not run deep, with joint programs across various sectors largely intact. that included dozens of annual joint military exercises over the past year. this year, the philippines military relied on u.s. technical support in its biggest ever urban battle, ending a five month occupation of a southern city by rebels loyal to islamic state.  there were no signs of an exodus of american business under duterte either, with $353 million of investments from the united states recorded in the first eight months of this year, compared to $90 million in the same period in 2016, according to the philippines central bank. there were conflicting accounts of what was discussed between trump and duterte on monday, however. a white house spokeswoman said human rights was talked about, in the context of the drugs war. duterte s spokesman, harry roque, said that was not the case, although duterte had explained his anti drugs campaign to trump, who nodded and  seemed to be in agreement .   the relationship appears to be very warm and very friendly, getting very candid,  roque said.  they have similar feelings toward former u.s. president barack obama.  duterte had said last week he would tell trump to  lay off  if he talked about human rights. but according to a senior white house official, duterte raised the issue himself.  he had an explanation and he pre emptively brought it up,  the official said, estimating duterte did 90 percent of the talking. the two leaders agreed to further strengthen the decades old defense alliance between them, one that duterte had previously threatened to abort.  heydarian, the professor, however said that even with improved ties, trump would be powerless to stop moves by duterte to diversify foreign relations beyond the united states to include china and russia, and tap them for anything from loans and infrastructure to rifles and jeeps.  i don t think that the trump duterte convivial hobnob will ever be enough to change duterte s strategic orientation,  he said.  we have stopped the hemorrhaging of the alliance, but it will never go back to being special and sacred as it was before duterte came to power.
