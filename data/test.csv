" a healthcare bill being unveiled by u.s. senate republicans on thursday is expected to roll back the obamacare expansion of the medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low income people buying private insurance. those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients’ income, a “major improvement” from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the house of representatives that tied them solely to age, republican senator susan collins said on wednesday. the washington post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for planned parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  the healthcare bill will be released to the republican senate conference on thursday morning and posted online, senators said. a vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. senate republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of obamacare, former democratic president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of medicaid. “there is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the obama healthcare law,” senator john barrasso, a member of the senate republican leadership, told cnn. “people across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.” democrats accuse republicans of sabotaging obamacare, and say the republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. democratic senator patty murray of washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was “every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the house.” president donald trump and fellow republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          some republican senators voiced concern on wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party’s leaders prepare to unveil it. republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. “i’d find it hard to believe we’ll have enough time,” he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, “i won’t be voting yes.” democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the republican led senate need at least two republicans to defect. the democrats have criticized the behind the scenes meetings, and blocked senate committees on wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, defending the closed door sessions, has said all senate republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that democrats are not interested in overhauling obamacare. once the plan is unveiled, senate republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the house version would be harmful for low income americans and people with pre existing health conditions, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday.  trump told a rally in iowa on wednesday night that he hoped the senate would come up with a “really good” bill. “i’ve been talking about a plan with heart,” trump said. he had privately called the house legislation “mean,” according to congressional sources. several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the medicaid expansion that took place under obamacare. moderates favored a seven year phase out, but the senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. there was also an argument over medicaid’s growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. “that’s what we’re told it might be,” said republican senator bill cassidy of louisiana.  cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost sharing subsidies made available to help low income americans under obamacare “for a couple of years.” collins, a moderate republican from maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan congressional budget office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  “the first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,” she said.  an estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the republican controlled house, according to the cbo.

" tens of thousands of muslims marched from the main mosque in indonesia s capital to a square in jakarta on sunday to protest against u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. it was the biggest protest in indonesia since trump s controversial move earlier this month to reverse decades of u.s. policy. police estimated the number attending the rally, organized by various muslim groups, at about 80,000. the protest was peaceful but rows of police behind coils of barbed wire held back the crowd outside the u.s. embassy in jakarta. a police spokesman said 20,000 police and members of the military were deployed to ensure security.   we urge all countries to reject the unilateral and illegal decision of president donald trump to make jerusalem israel s capital,  anwar abbas, the secretary general of the indonesian ulema council, told the crowd.    we call on all indonesian people to boycott u.s. and israel products in this country  if trump does not revoked his action, abbas said, reading from a petition due to be handed to the u.s. ambassador in indonesia. many of the protesters were clad in white and waved palestinian flags and held up placards, some reading:  peace, love and free palestine . there have been a series of protests in indonesia over the issue, including some where hardliners burned u.s. and israeli flags. the status of jerusalem, a city holy to jews, muslims and christians, is one of the biggest barriers to a lasting israeli palestinian peace. jerusalem s eastern sector was captured by israel in a 1967war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. palestinians claim east jerusalem for the capital of an independent state that they seek, while israel maintains that all of jerusalem is its capital.

" south korean president moon jae in will unveil an array of tv talent and k pop celebrities at events, including a state dinner, in china on thursday as he attempts to smooth out a year of difficult diplomacy with a star laden charm offensive.  south korean celebrities, including some of those accompanying moon, had been shut out of chinese television and concert halls as relations cooled between the east asian neighbors as they faced the threat posed by north korea s missile and nuclear programs. the thorniest issue was south korea s deployment of a u.s. anti missile system that china sees as a threat to its security. moon is hoping to use his first visit to china since taking office in may to build support for a diplomatic solution to the north korean crisis that has grown steadily through the year.  pyongyang tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile on nov. 29, which it said could put all of the united states within range, in defiance of international pressure and u.n. sanctions. meeting in beijing s great hall of the people, moon told chinese president xi jinping he would be discussing north korea with him.  i expect to reaffirm and discuss specific cooperation with president xi about our common position that we ll address the north korean nuclear issue, which is threatening peace and security of not only the northeast asia region but the entire world, in a peaceful manner and establish eternal peace on the korean peninsula,  moon said in comments in front of reporters.      moon also oversaw the signing of a memorandum on follow up negotiations about services and investments under a south korea china free trade agreement. top south korean actress song hye kyo, star of 2016 s hit drama  descendants of the sun  and the face of many south korean cosmetics brands, will join moon and xi in a state dinner later on thursday. song will be joined by married south korean and chinese actors, choo ja yeon and xiaoguang yu.  boy band exo, one of the top earning artists of major k pop talent agency s.m. entertainment, joined moon and song at a bilateral business event earlier on thursday. the presence of such celebrities reflects seoul s hope to break the ice after the row over its deployment of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) anti missile system. china complains that the thaad system s powerful radar can see far into its territory and does nothing to ease tension with north korea.  the thaad deployment cost south korean firms such as k pop businesses dearly as china retaliated. concerts in china by major k pop artists have been halted since the second half of 2016, south korean celebrities dropped from advertisements and south korean dramas all but disappeared from chinese tv channels this year, korean entertainment industry officials said. xi told moon that relations between their countries had experienced  some setbacks    likely a reference to the thaad dispute   but that he hoped his visit would be an important opportunity to improve them.  as friendly neighbors and strategic partners, china and south korea have broad common interests in keeping the region peaceful and promoting mutual developments,  xi said.  south korea and china share the goal of getting north korea to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing its increasingly sophisticated long range missiles, but the two have not seen eye to eye on how to achieve this. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson offered on tuesday to begin talks with north korea at any time and without pre conditions, but a white house official later said no negotiations could be held until north korea improved its behavior. moon, whose trip ends on saturday, has been accompanied by the largest business delegation ever to accompany a south korean leader abroad. the thaad disagreement is estimated to have knocked about 0.4 percentage points off expected economic growth in south korea this year and resulted in lost revenues of about $6.5 billion from chinese tourists in the first nine months of 2017, according to the bank of korea and korea tourism organisation.

" u.s. president barack obama and italian president sergio mattarella met on monday in the white house and discussed efforts to work together to combat the islamic state in libya. during a meeting in the oval office, obama and mattarella talked about the need to help libya form a united government. “that will allow us to help them build up their security capacity and to push back against efforts by isil to gain a foothold in that country,” obama told reporters after the meeting, using an acronym for islamic state.  islamic state forces have attacked libya’s oil infrastructure and taken control of the city of sirte, exploiting a power vacuum in the north african country where two rival governments have been battling for supremacy. obama and mattarella also discussed the refugee crisis facing europe and the situation in iraq and syria.

" vice president joe biden on thursday called on the republican led u.s. congress to allow an up or down vote on funding to combat the zika virus without other provisions attached, calling the health threat posed by the pathogen a national emergency. congress has failed to approve any funding to fight the mosquito borne virus since president barack obama asked for $1.9 billion in february.  lawmakers have been deadlocked for months over a $1.1 billion funding bill. democrats have accused republicans of attaching controversial provisions related to abortion that they cannot accept. republicans have accused democrats of blocking the bill to gain political advantage by portraying republicans as obstructionists on zika funding. “give us an up or down vote, straight, on zika,” biden said at an event on capitol hill with fellow democrats from the senate and house of representatives. “i understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation ... but this is a national emergency,” biden added. “people’s health, the well being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. act.” u.s. health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. there is no vaccine or treatment for zika. two top federal health officials also visited congress on thursday to underscore the importance of zika funding. “we’re all hopeful that the congress will come through with the money that’s needed to respond effectively to zika,” dr. tom frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, told reporters after meeting with senate democratic leaders alongside dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. house democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters that democrats want zika funding added to stop gap legislation that congress must pass by oct. 1 to keep federal agencies operating.  “by zika, i mean for a year. i don’t mean for three months,” pelosi said. “zika should be emergency spending. it should not be off set (requiring cuts in other government programs), because it is an emergency.”  a main issue is democrats’ opposition to language, backed by republicans, that they say would prevent zika funds for abortion providers like planned parenthood, mainly in puerto rico. the virus, first detected in brazil last year, has spread rapidly through the americas. florida is the only u.s. state so far where local mosquitoes are known to be transmitting zika.

" the budget proposal unveiled by the white house on tuesday cut all funding to a department of homeland security program known as “countering violent extremism,” which provides grants to communities to counter radicalism through outreach. the program, whose roots go back to the obama administration, has come under scrutiny by the trump administration and some congressional republicans who favor law enforcement, rather than community outreach, to fight what they see as a growing islamic extremist threat. at the beginning of the administration, some white house and dhs officials considered changing the name of the program to “countering islamic extremism,” and refocusing the funding only on grants that dealt with the islamic community,  not other communities that may have extremist views like white supremacists. the trump administration has frozen $10 million in grants allocated at the end of the obama administration under the countering violent extremism program and has yet to reallocate the funds.  the funding cuts proposed by the budget would reduce the $50 million currently allocated for the program down to zero for fiscal year 2018.  congress must vote to pass the budget and it will likely be amended before being enacted.

" brazilian lawmakers rejected corruption charges against president michel temer on wednesday evening, shelving a case that had threatened to oust a center right leader who investors hope will bring brazil s budget deficit under control. the corruption case, involving the payment of bribes by meatpacker jbs sa (jbss3.sa), had paralyzed temer s reform agenda for six months and weakened his government. the lower house of brazil s congress, which has the authority to decide whether a president should stand trial by the supreme court, voted 251 233 to throw out charges of obstruction of justice and organized crime filed by federal prosecutors.  the vote means that temer is safe from prosecution while he remains president. but he is still subject to investigation and possible trial by lower courts after his term ends in late 2018. while temer s opponents were far from the 342 votes   or two thirds of the seats   needed to put him on trial, he got 12 votes less than in august when the lower house voted 263 227 to block an initial corruption charge against him. the slip in support signals temer will have trouble passing a pension reform bill that is crucial for plugging brazil s budget deficit. many lawmakers are reluctant to back the reform, which would make brazilians work more years before retirement. the speaker of the house, rodrigo maia, said the shelving of the charges against temer cleared the way for the government and congress to move ahead with the pension reform debate. allies said brazil could not afford the upheaval of removing a second president in little over a year, as latin america s largest economy struggles to overcome deep recession. temer succeeded impeached leftist president dilma rousseff in 2016. opponents criticized temer for making policy concessions and fast tracking pork barrel spending to win votes to ensure his survival. to please the powerful farm lobby that has two fifths of the votes in the lower house, temer agreed to lower fines for environmental damage. he attempted to relax a definition of slave labor, but was forced to backtrack after an outcry. a few hours before the vote, temer was taken to hospital in pain due to a urinary tract obstruction, a health scare that triggered a brief selloff in financial markets. his office said he underwent a bladder test by catheter and left the hospital later on wednesday. temer, 77, was recently diagnosed with a partial coronary artery blockage. brazil's benchmark bovespa stock index .bvsp closed up 0.47 percent at 76,706 points after the house reached a quorum allowing the vote to go ahead. earlier, it touched session lows on the news that temer was in the hospital. stocks later pared losses and the currency was flat after his office gave details of his condition.

" lebanon s top court on friday sentenced habib shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president elect bashir gemayel, an event that was a turning point in lebanon s 15 year civil war.  shartouni, a member of the syrian socialist nationalist party (ssnp), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.  he was quoted in an interview in lebanon s al akhbar newspaper on thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in syria between 1994 and 2004. he did not reveal his present location.  gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with israel. his assassination occurred during israel s 1982 invasion of lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.  his death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many lebanese and triggered the massacre of palestinians in beirut s sabra and chatila refugee camps.  supporters of both shartouni and gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.  gemayel was head of the lebanese forces christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, muslim and palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by israel.  its invasion was aimed at driving from lebanon the palestine liberation organisation (plo), as well as the syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.  after his assassination, israel entered the capital beirut and allowed gemayel s militia, the lebanese forces, to access the sabra and chatila palestinian refugee camps, where their  fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.  gemayel s family is still one of the most important in lebanese politics, heading the kataeb party that was founded by his father. the lebanese forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, samir geagea.

" a pakistani anti corruption court on thursday indicted ousted prime minister nawaz sharif and his daughter over allegations linked to ownership of london properties, opening a trial that could see the former leader jailed. the sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable.  sharif, 67, resigned in july after the supreme court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling pakistan muslim league nawaz (pml n) party. sharif said there was no precedent for indicting someone in his absence.  i hope i will get justice,  he told reporters in london in remarks broadcast by local geo tv, adding that he would travel home to attend the next court hearing.  judge bashir ahmad of the court that tries cases registered and investigated by an anti graft body, the national accountability bureau (nab), indicted sharif, his daughter maryam sharif and her husband, muhammad safdar. they all pleaded not guilty.  maryam and safdar were present in court, but sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, sent a representative while he tends to his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment in britain.  maryam said in the court that the charges were unfounded and baseless.  this will go down in history as a travesty of justice,  she said. outside the court, maryam again hinted at military interference in the judicial process by saying the trial was  a repeat of 1999 , the year her father was toppled in a military coup led by former army chief pervez musharraf. it is not clear if she was comparing the trial to the coup, or subsequent corruption accusations and investigations that musharraf ordered into sharif. sharif s disqualification stemmed from the panama papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the british virgin islands and used them to buy posh flats in london. the supreme court initially declined to dismiss sharif but ordered an investigation into his family s wealth.  a separate supreme court appointed panel said the family s wealth did not match its income, and accused maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy the london flats.  after the probe, the top court disqualified sharif and ordered the nab to investigate and conduct a trial. sharif denies ever receiving the small source of income that led to his disqualification.  the nab has in the past been described as toothless because of its low conviction rates, especially when it comes to powerful politicians, and investigations that last many years. but the supreme court has ordered the trial to be concluded within six months.    opening arguments are due to begin on oct. 26.

" a senator from cambodia s main opposition party was pardoned on wednesday from the seven year jail sentence he had been given over a facebook posting, in a conciliatory sign from prime minister hun sen towards his opponents. a crackdown on the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) has led to the arrest of party leader kem sokha on treason charges and a government push to have it dissolved completely. that has brought protests from western donors. senator hong sok hour, 59, was sentenced last year over a fake official document he had posted on facebook saying that cambodia and vietnam had decided to dissolve their border. it is a sensitive subject in cambodia, where hun sen s opponents have long accused him of being a vietnamese puppet since he was put in his post in 1985 when vietnam occupied cambodia after ousting the genocidal khmer rouge. hong sok hour was pardoned by king norodom sihamoni at hun sen s request.  he wrote a letter of apology to samdech decho and asked him to write to the king to issue a pardon,  phay siphan told reuters, using hun sen s official title.  he admitted his fault.  hun sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one party state for the ruling cambodian people s party (cpp) and to ensure that he wins a general election next year without any effective challenge. the opposition welcomed the pardon.  this is a positive sign and each time there s a royal pardon, the political situation calms down,  said mu sochua, a deputy to kem sokha who fled into exile fearing that she was about to be arrested, too. however, hun sen reiterated on wednesday that the cnrp would be dissolved and any elected officials who defected from the opposition to his party would be allowed to keep their positions.

" a u.s. congressional panel has asked pharmaceutical entrepreneur martin shkreli to testify at a jan. 26 hearing about his company’s decision to raise the price of a life saving prescription drug, according to a republican committee staffer. shkreli, who became known as “pharma bro,” created a fire storm last year after his company turing pharmaceuticals hiked the price of a drug called daraprim by more than 5,000 percent. last month, shkreli was forced to step down as turing ceo amid criminal and civil securities fraud charges alleging he ran a ponzi like scheme during his tenure at the hedge fund msmb capital management and while he was the ceo of retrophin, another drug company he previously headed. the securities fraud charges are unrelated to the drug pricing probe by the committee. the hearing before the house of representatives committee on oversight and government reform will primarily focus on turing’s price spike of daraprim, and price hikes for two of valeant pharmaceutical’s heart medications   isuprel and nitropress. a democratic committee staffer told reuters on friday that valeant’s interim ceo howard schiller is also expected to appear at the hearing. a valeant spokeswoman confirmed that schiller will attend, and said he looks forward to testifying and that the company is cooperating with the ongoing congressional probe. an attorney for shkreli declined to comment. earlier this month, house oversight chairman jason chaffetz and ranking member elijah cummings jointly sent document requests to valeant, turing and shkreli. in their requests, the lawmakers asked for documents showing each company’s gross revenues and profits from the sales of the drugs in question, as well as communications by the ceos in connection with the drugs. since then, turing has given tens of thousands of documents to u.s. congressional investigators ahead of the hearing, according to a democratic committee staffer. a spokeswoman for turing did not have an immediate comment. the committee is expected to review another batch of documents from valeant in the near future. the deadline for submission is jan. 22. the house oversight panel’s interest in drug pricing was sparked by cummings, who for more than a year has called for the republican led panel to probe prescription drug pricing. in a statement, cummings said he is glad there is now bipartisan support for an investigation. he said americans are “fed up with watching major drug companies rake in record profits while they continue to struggle to afford their medicines.” ",0
" cuba told senior u.s. officials during talks on migration in havana on monday that the u.s. decision to suspend visa processing at its embassy on the island was  seriously hampering  family relations and other people exchanges. relations between the former cold war foes became strained after donald trump became the u.s. president, partially reversing the thaw seen during barack obama s presidency.  in september, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in havana, the u.s. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing.  the cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the u.s. government ... have on migration relations between both countries,  the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. the statement was issued after delegations led by cuba s foreign ministry chief for u.s. affairs josefina vidal and u.s. deputy assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs john creamer met to discuss migration issues. many cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. while cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million cuban americans in the united states.    the trump administration also issued a warning on travel to cuba and in october expelled 15 cuban diplomats from washington.  the cuban foreign ministry said this had  seriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the consulate and the services it offers to cubans residing in the united states . the u.s. decision to cancel the visits of official  delegations to cuba was also having a  counterproductive effect  on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said. on the positive side, both the u.s. and cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal cuban migration to the united states during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations. obama, who announced the detente with cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all cubans who arrived on u.s. turf in january, just before leaving office. cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking.  apprehensions of cuban migrants at u.s. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,  the u.s. state department said in a statement. trump said in june he was canceling obama s  terrible and misguided deal  with havana, returning to cold war rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions. he has however in practise left in place many of obama s changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct u.s. cuba commercial flights and cruise ship travel.

" prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into u.s. stock markets are fading fast as republican donald trump’s victory odds lengthen. a reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark s&p 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the nov. 8 election. moreover, based on options term structures   calculated from prices of options with different expirations   it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome, even with election day barely two weeks away, michael purves, head of derivatives research at weeden & co, said. “there had been a modest premium bump for november options a few weeks ago, but that seems to have faded steadily with trump’s slide in polls,” purves said. in a reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month, a victory by democrat hillary clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term.  trump’s chances of defeating clinton to capture the white house have diminished markedly over the last several weeks, according to most polls and prediction markets. the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project, which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 electoral college votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today. the most likely outcome would be 326 votes for clinton to 212 for trump. on predictit, a popular online predictions and betting market, clinton’s implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago. the lack of positioning for an election related volatility shock is consistent across the options market. “i just don’t see a whole lot of shifting of positions. i don’t see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that. it’s a little bit surprising,” said randy frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at charles schwab, austin, texas. “if it was a much closer race it might have been a different story, but the polls have hillary clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea,” frederick said. a brookings institution study published on friday from two u.s. economics professors concluded that a clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility, whereas a trump victory would send it soaring. justin wolfers, of the university of michigan, and eric zitzewitz, of dartmouth college, said recent market reactions to pre election events, including the first trump clinton debate and the release of a video of trump making vulgar comments about women, signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a clinton win. (tinyurl.com/zl4ew4u) while the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the s&p 500 index, individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election related volatility, derivatives analysts at deutsche bank said in a recent note. and just because investors are not braced for election linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm, analysts said. given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for november, the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result. “if you think trump will win, you want to get long spx puts or long cboe volatility index calls right now as protection,” said purves, referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility. a clean sweep by the democrats of the house of representatives, the senate and the white house could also unleash volatility, purves said. indeed, there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election. for s&p 500 index weekly contracts expiring on nov. 11, puts outnumber calls by a 2.1 to 1 margin, compared with 1.9 to 1 for all expirations, according to thomson reuters data. prices for at the money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1.8 percent move, up or down, in the s&p 500 by then, while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2.1 percent. nonetheless, demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap, and getting cheaper.  for instance, the cost for an s&p index option conveying the right to sell an s&p index future at the 2,050 level, about 4 percent below friday’s close, and expiring on nov. 9, the day after the election, has plunged from $12.42 on monday to $4.80 on friday, a 61 percent decline. with trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether republicans can keep their narrow majority in the senate or even their larger advantage in the house of representatives. “gridlock is the most market friendly outcome, and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating,” purves said.

" french president emmanuel macron said on wednesday he did not support u.s. president donald trump s  unilateral  decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and called for calm across the region.  this decision is a regrettable decision that france does not approve of and goes against international law and all the resolutions of the u.n. security council,  macron told reporters at a news conference in algiers. trump reversed decades of u.s. policy on wednesday and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and said he would move the embassy to the city, despite warnings from around the world that the gesture further drives a wedge between israel and the palestinians.  the status of jerusalem is a question of international security that concerns the entire international community. the status of jerusalem must be determined by israelis and palestinians in the framework of negotiations under the auspices of the united nations,  he said.  macron, who has developed a good working relationship with trump since taking office in may, spoke to the u.s. leader earlier this week to try to convince him to change his mind.  france and europe are attached to a two state solution   israel and palestine   leaving side by side in peace and security within recognized international borders with jerusalem the capital of both states,  he said, adding that paris was ready to work with partners to find a solution.  he called for calm.  for now, i urge for calm and for everyone to be responsible. we must avoid at all costs avoid violence and foster dialogue,  he said.

" britain s queen elizabeth praised the resilience of london and manchester after  appalling attacks , in a christmas message that also paid tribute to her husband, prince philip, who retired from regular royal duties this year. the  powerful identities  of the capital and the northern english city had shone through after militant attacks as well as a devastating fire that destroyed the residential tower block grenfell tower in london, the queen said. the 91 year old monarch, whose televised address is an essential part of a traditional christmas in britain, said it had been a privilege to visit victims of the bomb attack at a pop concert in manchester, as she was able to witness the bravery and resilience of survivors first hand. on the 60th anniversary of her first televised christmas address, elizabeth said her reflections on the year had made her   grateful for the blessings of home and family , and praised her husband and his  unique  sense of humor. the 96 year old prince, also known as the duke of edinburgh, has been at the queen s side throughout her 65 years on the throne, and has often grabbed the headlines with his off color comments. elizabeth, the world s longest reigning monarch, celebrated her platinum wedding anniversary in november. philip retired from regular royal duties over the summer having carried out more than 22,000 solo engagements.  i don t know that anyone had invented the term  platinum  for a 70th wedding anniversary when i was born. you weren t expected to be around that long,  she said.   even prince philip has decided it s time to slow down a little   having, as he economically put it,  done his bit . but i know his support and unique sense of humor will remain as strong as ever.      philip has continued to make occasional appearances, and joined other members of the royal family at a christmas day church service on their country estate in sandringham. also joining them for the service was prince harry s fiancee meghan markle who is spending christmas with the royals. the american actress wore a distinctive brown hat as she arrived alongside the queen s grandson harry, his elder brother william and his wife kate.  as they left, both couples briefly chatted to some well wishers who had gathered to glimpse the royals on christmas morning. the queen, who missed last year s service with a heavy cold, said in her address that she was looking forward to welcoming new members into the royal family next year. as well as markle, who will marry harry in may, kate is expecting a third child. the royal christmas broadcast dates back to king george v in 1932 when it was on the radio. it was first televised in 1957.

" michigan governor rick snyder said on friday he wants officials to focus on solving problems around lead contaminated drinking water in the city of flint instead of laying blame as he said some have been doing. “there are a number of folk out there that are spending their time mainly on the political side and the blame side,” he said at a meeting in flint of local and state officials responding to the crisis. snyder’s comments came a day after liberal group progress michigan released emails showing high ranking state officials knew about an increase in legionnaires’ disease in genesee county, where flint is located, and a possible link to the contaminated water almost a year before the governor said he got information about the outbreak. snyder, who has repeatedly apologized for the state’s poor handling of the crisis, previously said he did not learn of the rise in legionnaires’ cases until last month.     the governor and state officials have been criticized for not catching the contaminated water sooner, with some calling for snyder to resign.  later on friday, snyder’s office said the former head of the state department of environmental quality’s drinking water and municipal assistance unit, liane shekter smith, was fired. she and a second employee were suspended last month, and a state spokesman cited a civil service rule allowing for termination due to failure to do one’s job.  a second deq employee, environmental manager stephen busch, remains on suspension and no decision has been made on his status, state officials said. flint, near detroit, was under the control of a state appointed emergency manager when it switched the source of its tap water from detroit’s system to the flint river in april 2014 to save money. it switched back last october after tests found high levels of lead in samples of children’s blood. the more corrosive water from the river leached more lead from the city pipes than detroit water did. lead can damage the nervous system. on friday, lawmakers on a u.s. house of representatives panel said they plan to hold a hearing next month to address flint health and infrastructure issues. the energy and commerce panel did not have details on the date or who would testify. this week, congress held its first hearing into the flint crisis. the house oversight committee did not invite snyder, a republican, to testify, something democrats on the panel complained bitterly about.

"led senate. he is the youngest supreme court nominee since republican president george h.w. bush in 1991 picked clarence thomas, who was 43 at the time.  don’t miss for hardline west bank settlers, jared kushner's their man he currently serves as a judge on the 10th u.s. circuit court of appeals in denver, the city where he was born. he was appointed to that post in 2006 by republican president george w. bush.  gorsuch, who is white, adds little diversity to the court compared with the justices appointed by democratic president barack obama, both of whom were women, one becoming the first latina justice.  but he offers geographical diversity to a court dominated by justices from the east and west coasts. as an episcopalian, he would be the only protestant on the court, which has three jewish justices and five catholics.  exclusive poll: a third of americans think travel ban will make them safer gorsuch is seen by analysts as a jurist similar to scalia, who died on feb. 13, 2016. scalia, praised by gorsuch as “a lion of the law,” was known not only for his hard line conservatism but for interpreting the u.s. constitution based on what he considered its original meaning, and laws as written by legislators. like scalia, gorsuch is known for sharp writing skills.  “it is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives,” gorsuch said on tuesday at the white house event announcing the nomination in remarks that echoed scalia’s views.  trump, a republican, had the chance to nominate gorsuch because the republican led u.s. senate last year refused to consider obama’s nominee, appeals court judge merrick garland.  democrats, angered by the treatment of garland, and opposing gorsuch’s conservative views, may seek to block his nomination.  trump may have favored gorsuch for the job in hopes of a smoother confirmation process than for other potential candidates such as appeals court judge william pryor, who has called the 1973 supreme court ruling legalizing abortion “the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.”  the federal government is familiar territory for gorsuch, who is the son of anne burford, the first woman to head the u.s. environmental protection agency. she served as republican president ronald reagan’s top environmental official but resigned in 1983, just 22 months into the job, amid a fight with congress over documents on the epa’s use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide.  she was criticized by environmentalists for cutting the agency’s enforcement efforts against polluters and slowing payments for cleaning up toxic waste.  the high court is also familiar ground for gorsuch, who served as a clerk for two justices including a current member of the court, anthony kennedy, a conservative who often casts a deciding vote in close decisions. if confirmed, he would become the first clerk to join a former boss on the supreme court. gorsuch also served as a clerk for justice byron white, a john f. kennedy appointee, who retired from the court in 1993.  gorsuch has strong, ivy league academic qualifications: attending columbia university and, like several of the other justices on the court, harvard law school, graduating the same year as obama. he completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at oxford university, spent several years in private practice and worked in george w. bush’s justice department.  in a 2005 article in the conservative national review magazine, gorsuch criticized american liberals’ “overweening addiction to the courtroom” to implement a social agenda “on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide.” in his senate confirmation hearing for his appellate court judgeship, he said the point of the article could be applied to groups across the political spectrum.  in 2013, gorsuch played a role in a high profile ruling involving arts and crafts retailer hobby lobby, allowing owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to an obamacare provision requiring employers to provide health insurance covering birth control for women.  the decision, later upheld by the u.s. supreme court, said the provision violated a federal law called the religious freedom restoration act. in a concurrence, gorsuch expressed sympathy for the choice faced by the evangelical christian owners of the company “between exercising their faith or saving their business.”  gorsuch also criticized an important legal doctrine that directs courts to defer to federal agencies’ interpretation of statutes. last august, in a case over immigration rules, gorsuch called the doctrine the “elephant in the room” that concentrates federal power “in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution.”  he has written extensively on the topic of assisted suicide and euthanasia, arguing against legalization. in written questions related to his senate confirmation hearings, he was asked whether his writings would make him biased in any case on the matter before him. he said his personal views would play no role in his decisions as a judge.  gorsuch is married with two teenage daughters, and lives outside of boulder, colorado.  friends and former clerks said he was a lover of the outdoors, describing him as an excellent skier, a fly fisherman and a runner.  “we used to joke that he should be the face of colorado tourism,” former gorsuch clerk jane nitze said.

" australian police on monday used metal cutters to remove five protesters who had chained themselves to the gate of the prime minister s official residence over the treatment of asylum seekers detained in papua new guinea. papua new guinea police last week expelled about 400 protesting asylum seekers from a shuttered australian run detention camp on manus island. the united nations decried the crackdown as  shocking . the manus island detention camp, and another in the south pacific island nation of nauru, have been cornerstones of australia s policy under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores. the policy, aimed at deterring people from making a perilous sea voyage to australia, has been heavily criticized by the united nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in australia. but some people, including some christian groups, object to it.  it s our hope that as church leaders we can actually respond ... in non violent ways, in peaceful ways that actually highlight the issue and do justice to the beauty and the courage of the men on manus island,  said one of the protesters, jarod mckenna, who said he was a christian pastor. prime minister malcolm turnbull does not live in the official residence and he was not there during the three hour protest which ended when police ordered the five to keep still while the chains were cut from around their necks. they were then taken away in a police vehicle. there were no reports of injuries, police said. australia says allowing asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores would only encourage people smugglers in asia and see more people risk their lives trying to reach australia. australia closed the manus island detention center on oct. 31, after it was declared illegal by a papua new guinea court. the asylum seekers, who have said they fear for their safety as well as being resettled in papua new guinea or another developing country, were taken to transit centers. australia has rejected an offer from new zealand to resettle 150 of the men, and is instead aiming to sending up to 1,250 of them to the united states under a swap deal.  so many people feel hopeless,  kurdish journalist and manus island detainee behrouz boochani told reuters by text message from one of the transit centers.         papua new guinea immigration and police officials did not return reuters  telephone calls or emails.

" former u.s. president bill clinton on wednesday called running his family’s charitable foundation one of the great honors of his life in a passionate defense against criticism of its work as his wife, hillary clinton, campaigns to become president. speaking onstage in a new york city hotel ballroom for about an hour, he told supporters of the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation that it had brought about “a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.”  “don’t give up what brought you here,” he said, closing out the 12th and final annual conference organized by the foundation, called the clinton global initiative. “you have done something good and noble and worthy.” the foundation, which clinton founded as he prepared to leave the white house in 2001, has come under intense scrutiny brought about by a long presidential campaign.  journalists have scoured newly released email records from hillary clinton’s tenure running the state department from 2009 to 2013, which show foundation officials seeking meetings with clinton or other diplomats on behalf of donors.  donald trump, clinton’s republican opponent for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of breaching government ethics rules. the clintons have said that even if some of their wealthiest donors, which include corporations and foreign governments with interests before the u.s. government, may have hoped for special favors in return, none were granted. to avert suggestions of conflicts of interest, the foundation has said it will drastically limit its operations if hillary clinton, the democratic party’s presidential candidate, wins the election to succeed barack obama on nov. 8.  it would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate donors, foundation officials say, and much of its work would be spun off into independent entities not controlled by the clintons. bill clinton, 70, has expressed frustration that political journalists covering his wife’s campaign have written more about the foundation’s donors, which include the government of saudi arabia and foreign billionaires, than the charitable programs it runs.  he spoke at length about how he had been moved by meeting children with hiv in cambodia, orphans left behind by the 2004 tsunami that struck indonesia and victims of the earthquake in haiti in 2010. he made only oblique references to the 2016 election campaign. “everywhere today there is a temptation to say that everything i just told you is wrong, ‘life is a zero sum game and i’m losing; no, you’re wrong, our differences matter more than our common humanity,’” he said. “these are not the right choices.” (refiles to make clear in paragraph 5 that foundation officials were seeking the meetings on behalf of donors.)

" prime minister theresa may will press on friday for britain to have a new security partnership with the european union after brexit, visiting 800 british troops in northern estonia to strengthen her case. security cooperation is seen by british government officials as one of their strongest arguments to gain leverage in the complicated talks to unravel more than 40 years of union, and may will again underline britain s role in european defense. in a speech in florence last week, may sought to re set the tone of talks and nudge them forward, after they all but stalled over the divorce settlement, especially over the so called brexit bill. but after another week of talks in brussels, eu negotiators said there had not been enough progress yet to move to the next phase of discussions on a transition period after brexit or a future trade deal.  with the largest defense budget in europe, a far reaching diplomatic network, world class security, intelligence and law enforcement services, and our position at the heart of nato, the uk s role in europe s defense has never been more vital,  may said on the eve of an eu meeting in the estonian capital.  as we prepare for brexit, i want to build a bold, new security partnership with the eu. a partnership that reflects our shared history, promotes our common values, and maintains a secure and prosperous europe.  the informal get together in tallinn, arranged before a  digital summit  on issues ranging from data and cybersecurity to taxing online businesses, has no set agenda, allowing may another chance to pitch her brexit ideas. she sought to re set the tone of the negotiations, using the speech in florence to offer some concessions on the future role of the european court in britain and over the cost of the divorce, moves which were cautiously welcomed. but by focusing on defense in tallinn, may will want to show that britain has something to offer its european neighbors and will say she is ready to share british expertise   including through the national cyber security centre (ncsc)   to help eu nations build up their own cyber security capability.  we will continue to work with our nato allies, our european neighbors and the eu, to support a future partnership of unprecedented breadth and depth,  she said in a statement.  that will guarantee the security and stability of the continent for generations to come.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on thursday he had signed orders to send additional troops to afghanistan, the most concrete step yet by president donald trump’s administration in tackling america’s longest war. mattis did not specify the size of the force, which will help combat taliban insurgents and other armed islamists.      “yes, i have signed orders but it is not complete. in other words i have signed some of the (orders for) troops that will go and we are identifying the specific ones,” mattis told reporters. mattis said he would not comment on how many additional troops were included in the orders until he briefs congress next week, but u.s. officials have told reuters that trump has given mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to afghanistan.  “it is more advisers, it is more enablers, fire support, for example,” mattis said. he added that no additional troops had moved in yet and could take a “couple of days.” after a months long review of his afghanistan policy, trump committed the united states last week to an open ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped up campaign against afghan taliban insurgents. about 11,000 u.s. troops are serving in afghanistan, the pentagon said on wednesday, thousands more than it has previously stated.     mattis said that the make up of those u.s. forces in afghanistan would also start changing in line with trump’s guidance.  any increase of several thousand troops would leave u.s. forces in afghanistan well below their peak of more than 100,000 troops in 2011, when washington was under huge domestic political pressure to draw down the costly operation. some u.s. officials have told reuters they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. to date, more than 2,300 americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded in afghanistan. the security situation in afghanistan has deteriorated for the united states and afghan government over the past few years. the afghan government was assessed by the u.s. military to control or influence almost 60 percent of afghanistan’s 407 districts as of feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the u.s. special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction.  earlier this month, the taliban told trump in an open letter that the military situation in afghanistan was “far worse than you realize”, and sending in more troops would be self destructive. the taliban, seeking to restore strict islamic law, has waged an insurgency against the western backed afghan government since losing power in a u.s. led invasion after the sept. 11 attacks in 2001. those attacks were planned by al qaeda leader osama bin laden from a base in afghanistan.

" constant cyber attacks on the u.s. missile defense agency and its key weapons programs pose as great a threat as development of intercontinental ballistic missiles by iran and north korea, the admiral who heads the agency said on thursday. vice admiral james syring told a house armed services subcommittee that the agency had taken “inordinate” measures to defend its own networks, but he remained concerned about potential vulnerabilities among defense contractors. the u.s. missile defense agency develops and runs a multilayered system of defenses against ballistic missile attacks by potential enemies. the system includes ground based interceptor missiles in alaska and california as well as high end radar equipment to detect attacks. syring said the agency carried out continuous monitoring of its classified and unclassified networks, but said cyber attacks were increasingly directed against private contractors and unclassified, controlled technical information that they housed on their networks. “what we’ve got to do is get them up to where we are in terms of our protection levels, and i view it as a very near term, very real requirement across the (ballistic missile defense system),” he said. u.s. defense officials have been increasingly vocal about escalating and constant cyber attacks originating from china, russia and other countries. syring did not answer directly when asked about his knowledge of attacks on the agency’s networks by china or the chinese military, telling lawmakers he would provide fuller answers during a classified hearing.  syring told a similar senate hearing on wednesday that the agency was working “hand in glove” with private contractors to ensure that future contracts contained the necessary cyber security requirements, protections and standards. deputy defense secretary robert work told reuters this week that the pentagon’s cyber investment management board had prepared a list of top priority weapons programs that required cyber security updates and investments. he said the details were classified, but said some of those programs were launched years ago before cyber attacks became commonplace.

" the white house excluded several major u.s. news organizations, including some it has criticized, from an off camera briefing held by the white house press secretary on friday. reporters for cnn, the new york times, politico, the los angeles times and buzzfeed were not allowed into the session in the office of press secretary sean spicer. spicer’s off camera briefing, or “gaggle,” replaced the usual televised daily news briefing in the white house briefing room. he did not say why those particular news organizations were excluded, a decision which drew strong protests. reuters was included in the session, along with about 10 other news organizations, including bloomberg and cbs. president donald trump has regularly attacked the media and at a gathering of conservative activists on friday he criticized  news organizations that he said provide “fake news”, calling them the “enemy” of the american people. spicer said his team decided to have a gaggle in his office on friday instead of a full briefing in the larger white house briefing room and argued that “we don’t need to do everything on camera every day.”  reporters at the associated press and time magazine walked out of the briefing when hearing that others had been barred from the session.  off camera gaggles are not unusual. the white house often invites handpicked outlets in for briefings, typically for specific topics. but briefings and gaggles in the white house are usually open to all outlets and they are free to ask anything. a pool reporter from hearst newspapers was included in the gaggle on friday and gave full details to the entire press corps. media outlets allowed into the gaggle also shared their audio with others. spicer’s decision drew a sharp response from some of the media outlets that were excluded. “nothing like this has ever happened at the white house in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” dean baquet, executive editor of the new york times, said in a statement.  “we strongly protest the exclusion of the new york times and the other news organizations. free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.” the white house correspondents association, or whca, also protested. “the whca board is protesting strongly against how today’s gaggle is being handled by the white house,” said jeff mason, president of the association and a reuters reporter. during the election campaign last year, trump’s team banned a few news organizations, including the washington post and buzzfeed, from covering his campaign rallies for a period of time to protest their coverage. cnn posted a twitter message on friday afternoon saying: “this is an unacceptable development by the trump white house. apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like. we’ll keep reporting regardless.” ben smith, editor in chief of buzzfeed news, said in a statement: “while we strongly object to the white house’s apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we won’t let these latest antics distract us from continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively.” on friday, spicer said the white house plans to fight against what it says is unfair coverage. “i think we’re going to aggressively push back,” he said.  “we’re just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there.” ",0
" zimbabwean president robert mugabe has been removed as a goodwill ambassador, the world health organization said on sunday, following outrage among western donors and rights groups at his appointment. who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus named mugabe to the largely ceremonial post at a meeting on wednesday in uruguay on chronic diseases attended by both men.  at the time, tedros praised zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all . but tedros said in a statement that he had listened to those expressing concerns and heard the  different issues  raised.  over the last few days, i have reflected on my appointment of h.e. president robert mugabe as who goodwill ambassador for ncds (non communicable diseases) in africa. as a result i have decided to rescind the appointment,  tedros said. the decision had been taken after consultation with the harare government and was  in the best interests of the world health organization , he said. jeremy farrar, a global health specialist and director of the wellcome trust charity and the ncd alliance, representing health groups combating chronic diseases, welcomed the reversal.  dr tedros deserves all our support to ensure he and who build a global health movement that is inclusive and works to improve health for everyone,  farrar said in a statement.  zimbabwean foreign minister walter muzembi accepted the move while insisting that who had  benefited tremendously  from having nominated mugabe and the media buzz it brought to health issues.  so on the balance, it is wiser to let go, and help who focus on its mandate while we focus zimbabwe on its membership obligations,  muzembi said in a government statement. several former and current who staff had said privately they were appalled at the  poor judgment  and  miscalculation  by tedros, elected the first african head of who in may. mugabe was head of the african union when the bloc endorsed tedros   a former health and foreign minister of ethiopia   over other african candidates for the top post, without any real regional contest, they said.  mugabe, 93, is blamed in the west for destroying zimbabwe s economy and for numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. britain had said mugabe s appointment as a goodwill ambassador was  surprising and disappointing  and that it risked overshadowing the who s global work. the united states, which has imposed sanctions on mugabe for alleged human rights violations, also voiced disappointment.  he (tedros) has to remember where his funding comes from,  said one health official who declined to be identified. the trump administration, which is already questioning financial support for some united nations agencies, is who s largest single donor. who is struggling to recover a reputation tarnished by its slowness in tackling the ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people in west africa from 2014 2015 under tedros  predecessor, margaret chan. the agency is now grappling with a massive cholera outbreak in yemen that has infected some 800,000 people in the past year and a plague outbreak in madagascar that has killed nearly 100 in two months.

" bangladesh allowed two journalists from myanmar detained while reporting about fleeing rohingya muslims to fly home on tuesday and was dropping charges against them, their lawyer said.   minzayar oo and hkun lat were picked up from the cox bazar s region in early september because they were working as journalists on tourist visas, police said. they were released on bail after calls from germany s geo magazine, which had assigned minzayar oo to cover the influx of rohingya refugees from myanmar, as well as rights groups.  it s so good to be free again,  minzayar oo, one of myanmar s most prominent photographers, told reuters soon after his plane landed in the thai capital of bangkok. bangladesh authorities had begun the process to drop the charges against the pair, their lawyer, jyotirmoy barua, said. minzayar oo has worked for various media outlets, covering myanmar s emergence from military rule. he had previously worked as a contractor with reuters.  hkun lat is also a well known photographer in myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions. about 582,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered an army crackdown in response.

" the u.s. senate armed services committee approved 4,000 more visas for afghans who worked for u.s. forces as interpreters or support staff on wednesday, an effort to preserve a program that had been at risk of shutting down. the committee included the additional visas in its version of the annual national defense authorization act (ndaa), a must pass piece of legislation that sets priorities for the department of defense budget for fiscal 2018, which will be about $650 billion. the senate and house of representatives are currently working on separate versions of the legislation, which must be reconciled and passed by both chambers and signed by president donald trump before it can become law. the afghan special immigrant visa (siv) program allows afghans who worked for the u.s. government, often risking their lives, to move to the united states after a rigorous vetting process. bipartisan pushes by u.s. lawmakers this year for more siv visas have come against the backdrop of efforts by the trump administration to clamp down on immigration from majority muslim countries. in march, the u.s. embassy in kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for siv applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, but lawmakers included 2,500 more in a  spending bill in april to preserve the program. “our nation owes a great debt to the civilians who have provided essential assistance to the u.s. mission in afghanistan, and i am very pleased that this legislation authorizes the necessary visas for these brave men and women,” said democratic senator jeanne shaheen, who led the push for the legislation with republican senator john mccain, the armed services committee’s chairman.

" the white house vowed on sunday to fight the news media “tooth and nail” over what it sees as unfair attacks, with a top adviser saying the trump administration had presented “alternative facts” to counter low inauguration crowd estimates.   on his first full day as president, trump said he had a “running war” with the media and accused journalists of underestimating the number of people who turned out friday for his swearing in. white house officials made clear no truce was on the horizon on sunday in television interviews that set a much harsher tone in the traditionally adversarial relationship between the white house and the press corps. “the point is not the crowd size. the point is the attacks and the attempt to delegitimize this president in one day. and we’re not going to sit around and take it,” chief of staff reince priebus said on “fox news sunday.” the sparring with the media has dominated trump’s first weekend in office, eclipsing debate over policy and cabinet  appointments.  it was the main theme at the republican president’s first visit to the cia, at the press secretary’s first media briefing and in senior officials’ first appearances on the sunday talk shows.  together, they made clear the administration will continue to take an aggressive stance with news organizations covering trump.   “we’re going to fight back tooth and nail every day and twice on sunday,” priebus said. he repeated white house press secretary sean spicer’s assertions on saturday that the media manipulated photographs of the national mall to make the crowds on friday look smaller than they really were.  aerial photographs showed the crowds were significantly smaller than when barack obama took over as president in 2009. the washington subway system said it had 193,000 riders by 11 a.m. (1600 gmt) on friday, compared with 513,000 at that time during the 2009 inauguration. spicer’s categorical assertion that “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration   period” was widely challenged in media reports citing crowd count experts and was  lampooned on social media as well. asked on nbc’s “meet the press” why the press secretary was uttering provable falsehoods, white house senior adviser kellyanne conway fired back.  “if we are going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms i think that we are going to rethink our relationship here,” she said. conway responded to criticism that the new administration was focusing on crowds rather than on significant domestic and foreign policy issues by saying: “we feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there.” priebus and conway focused on a press pool report that said the bust of civil rights icon martin luther king jr. had been removed from the oval office after trump took office. the report on friday night was quickly corrected, but trump called out the reporter by name during a visit to the central intelligence agency on saturday. spicer also berated the reporter later in the day.   with the nov. 8 election results shadowed by u.s. intelligence reports of russian meddling on his behalf, trump has bristled at reports suggesting his popular support is soft and that the election was not legitimate. trump, who lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton by nearly 3 million votes, made no mention of russia in his first visit to the cia on saturday. he praised his nominee to head the agency, mike pompeo, and ranted against the “dishonest” media, a favorite target during his presidential campaign.  the president accused the media of fabricating his tensions with the u.s. intelligence community, despite his frequent posts on twitter that derided the agencies. trump drew criticism from democrats as well as former cia director john brennan for his remarks at the agency, where he spoke before a memorial wall with stars representing personnel killed in action. “president trump ought to realize he’s not campaigning anymore. he’s president,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on abc’s “this week.” “instead of talking about how many people showed up at his inauguration, he ought to be talking about how many people are going to stay in the middle class and move into the middle class.” ",0
" colombian president juan manuel santos said on friday that republican members of the u.s. congress had indicated their continuing support for colombia’s effort to achieve peace with leftist rebels and recover from years of civil war. his comments, at the state department, came a day after president barack obama said he planned to ask congress for more than $450 million in aid to help colombia implement a peace accord to end latin america’s longest war. asked whether republicans had backed the administration plan, santos told reporters at the state department he “did not hear one single voice” doubting the success of the current u.s. aid effort, plan colombia, and he had received “expressions of continuing support.” he said he did not receive any formal commitments but hoped congress would support the new proposal.

" president donald trump and democratic leaders in the u.s. congress have agreed to work together on legislation to protect “dreamers,” the illegal immigrants who were children when they entered the united states, the lawmakers said on wednesday, although a dispute erupted over exactly what had been agreed. following a dinner with trump at the white house, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the “productive meeting” focused on “daca,” a program established by former president barack obama. “we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca (deferred action for childhood arrivals) into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides,” schumer and pelosi said in a statement. all year, democrats have insisted that they will block any legislation that contains funding for a wall along the length of the u.s. border with mexico, a top trump campaign goal that many republicans in congress also do not support. while white house officials have suggested legislation on daca could move forward without wall funding, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders disputed the characterization that a deal had been reached to leave it out of any legislation focused on the dreamers. “while daca and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,” she said on twitter. throughout his 2016 campaign for president and since taking office in january, trump has demanded the construction of a wall to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. he initially said mexico would pay for the wall but has requested money from the u.s. congress after the government of mexico refused to pay. the dinner was the latest effort in a new initiative by trump to work with opposition party democrats on major legislation. following the dinner, a white house official said the president, schumer and pelosi discussed tax reform, immigration, border security, infrastructure investments and trade as part of trump’s bid to reach out to democrats. “the administration looks forward to continuing these conversations with leadership on both sides of the aisle,” the official said. over a dinner of chinese food, trump and the democratic leaders also discussed issues related to u.s. china trade, according to a congressional aide briefed on the meeting. schumer and pelosi also said that they urged trump to make permanent government subsidy payments under the affordable care act, also known as “obamacare.” “those discussions will continue,” the lawmakers said. trump and most republicans in congress have demanded the repeal of obamacare but have been unable to agree on a replacement for the healthcare program that became law in 2010. using his executive powers, trump canceled obama’s daca program in which about 800,000 undocumented young people have escaped the threat of deportation and been able to apply for work permits in the united states. trump argued that obama over stepped his authority in creating the program. but trump gave congress six months to come up with a replacement program in the form of legislation to be enacted into law. democratic representative henry cuellar, who attended a white house meeting with trump earlier on wednesday, told reporters the president said he would not insist on wall funding as part of a dreamers bill, but would pursue it on other, future legislation. cuellar said trump urged lawmakers to link a republican bill to cut legal immigration to the united states with protections for dreamers. but many democrats oppose lowering the cap on annual legal immigration.

" iran warned the united states against designating its revolutionary guards corp as a terrorist group and said u.s. regional military bases would be at risk if further sanctions were passed. the warning came after the white house said on friday that president donald trump would announce new u.s. responses to iran s missile tests, support for  terrorism  and cyber operations as part of his new iran strategy.  as we ve announced in the past, if america s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of iran s missiles,   guards  commander mohammad ali jafari said, according to state media. jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the united states, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to american troops.  if the news is correct about the stupidity of the american government in considering the revolutionary guards a terrorist group, then the revolutionary guards will consider the american army to be like islamic state all around the world particularly in the middle east,  jafari said. the revolutionary guards (irgc) are iran s most powerful internal and external security force. the quds force, the irgc s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the irgc are on the us list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.  iran sees the sunni muslim militants of islamic state as an existential threat to the islamic republic where the majority of the population are shi ites. on june 7, islamic state claimed an attack on tehran s parliament and the mausoleum of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, the founder of the islamic republic, killing 18 people. the guards fired missiles at islamic state bases in syria on june 18 in response. guards commanders have framed their military involvement in iraq and syria, where they are fighting to support the government of president bashar al assad, as a fight against islamic state. dozens of members of the guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in syria and iraq. the website for state tv reported jafari as adding that the united states was mistaken if it thought it could pressure iran into negotiating on regional issues. jafari also said that tehran would ramp up its defense capabilities, including its missile program, if the u.s. undermined a nuclear deal between iran and western powers. under the 2015 deal, iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions. however, trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.  the americans should know that the trump government s stupid behavior with the nuclear deal will be used by the islamic republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defense program,  jafari said, according to state media. the prospect of washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the u.s. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of north korea. if trump does not certify that iran is in compliance, the u.s. congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. u.n. inspectors have verified iranian compliance with the terms. the guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on sunday in the gulf, an area of tension with the u.s. navy in recent months. more than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a guards commander as saying.

" new thinking is needed from the british government to secure agreement on the irish border and allow brexit talks to move onto the next phase as the current proposals are not credible, ireland s foreign minister simon coveney said on tuesday. brussels wants three issues broadly solved before it decides in december whether brexit talks can move onto a second phase about trade, as britain wants. these are britain s exit bill, safeguarding expatriate rights, and the border between ireland and northern ireland, which will be the uk s only land frontier with the eu after its departure. after the latest round of negotiations ended with little obvious progress last week, coveney said there was still a way to go on the border proposals before the negotiating teams would be able to move on to the next phase.  the current approach the british government are taking is not compatible with the solutions that we need,  coveney told reporters.  some of the ideas they published in their paper late in the summer hint towards finding solutions to those problems, but i don t think they are comprehensive or credible ... we need more detail and we need to see some new thinking that is flexible and recognises the unique challenges of the island of ireland.  he was referring to proposals in august when london said there should be no infrastructure or electronic surveillance on the 500 km (300 mile) border, with smaller firms exempted from any new customs processes and  trusted trader arrangements  put in place to reduce the burden for larger companies. coveney said ireland did not think britain s three aims of quitting the eu s single market and customs union, that the whole of united kingdom leave together, and that there be no border infrastructure were compatible. the european union agreed with dublin s position, he said. some 30,000 people travel across the border every day via over 400 crossings without any controls, and the issue is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence over whether northern ireland should be part of the uk or ireland. around 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace agreement. dublin has said that the best way to retain the status quo is by keeping the same rules and regulations on both sides of the border.  we need a credible plan to avoid the imposition of border infrastructure in the future and we don t have it yet,  coveney said.

" former and current employees of the u.s. environmental protection agency expressed opposition to president donald trump’s pick to run the agency on monday   in an open letter and a small street protest   reflecting divisions over the new administration’s plans to slash regulation. over 400 former epa staff members sent a letter to the u.s. senate asking it to reject the nomination of oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt as the agency’s new leader, saying “he has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws.” in chicago, around 30 employees of the epa’s regional office there joined a protest organized by the sierra club environmental group and the american federation of government employees to protest pruitt’s nomination. doug eriksen, a spokesman for trump’s transition team at the epa, downplayed the chicago protest, saying “employees have a right to take action on their private time.”     trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. he nominated pruitt, who has sued the epa more than a dozen times as oklahoma’s top prosecutor to block its regulations, to run the agency, sparking alarm among democrats and environmentalists. last thursday, the senate environment committee approved pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panel’s democratic members. he is expected to be confirmed by the full senate, in republican control after last november’s election, but a date for the vote has not been set.  the former epa employees who sent the letter to the senate wrote that they believed pruitt has a history of siding with industry and has been reluctant to accept “the strong scientific consensus on climate change.” employees at the chicago rally raised concerns that pruitt may cut employees and resources needed for the agency to enforce environmental regulations.  “the epa needs to be able to enforce the rules when companies are breaking the law,” said sherry estes, an epa lawyer who participated in the protest.

" financial markets have fretted about the fiscal situation in washington, with deadlines looming in late september and early october to keep the u.s. government open and raise the debt ceiling. as congress returned on tuesday, aiding those affected by hurricane harvey and responding to president donald trump’s decision to scrap a program shielding immigrants brought to the u.s. illegally as children from deportation added to their already packed agenda. here is what you need to know about fiscal and other politically connected issues in play this month: the “debt ceiling” is a legal cap on how much money the u.s. government can borrow through bonds and other debt issued by the u.s. treasury. it now stands at about $19.8 trillion, very close to the actual national debt.  once the ceiling is hit, congress must raise it. if it does not, the government cannot keep borrowing. this matters because the government spends more than it collects in taxes and washington continually borrows money to cover its bills. legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted by early october at the very latest. the treasury, however, has said that congress must increase the debt ceiling by sept. 29. since march, the treasury has been using “extraordinary measures” to stave off hitting the ceiling and likely could be stave off default a few more weeks by using such extraordinary measures, analysts have said.  if the debt ceiling is not raised and the government can no longer pay its bills, default would result, along with a likely downgrade in the u.s. credit rating. this has never happened before, but there have been some close calls. a standoff in august 2011 cost the country its top notch bond rating from the credit ratings agency standard & poor’s and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the 2007 2009 global financial crisis. congress is supposed to pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on sept. 30 to fund most of the u.s. government, but disagreements often prevent this. when that happens, lawmakers usually pass a temporary bill extending current spending levels with no changes for a short period. it is expected this will happen again at the end of this month, likely extending current funding levels into december. congress returned from its long summer recess having only about 12 working days to pass a spending measure, probably a short term patch, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the government open. if even a short term patch cannot be agreed upon in congress, or if the president decides to veto either a long term or short term spending measure, the government would shut down. the last time the government shut down was in october 2013 for about two weeks. in the 1990s, 1980s and 1970s, there were 17 shutdowns. shutdowns hurt federal workers, rattle markets and shake confidence in the united states abroad, but they have done little lasting economic damage. the two move on separate tracks but could get tangled together as some analysts have said that congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time, perhaps in a single piece of legislation. passing an initial tranche of federal aid, expected to be about $8 billion, for individuals affected by hurricane harvey now tops the congressional agenda.  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that raising the debt ceiling, keeping the government open and passing an assistance package for harvey victims were three “critically important things” that congress needed to get done quickly.  there has been some speculation that harvey aid could be tied to a short term continuing resolution or a measure raising the debt ceiling, or that all three could be linked in some way. separate from harvey assistance is the national flood insurance program, operated by the federal emergency management agency, which expires on sept. 30.  the program provides insurance policies for homeowners that cover up to $350,000 in damages. congressional disagreements over changes to the program, which operates in debt to the treasury, have complicated plans to restructure the program in the past. it is not yet clear how harvey, which will generate additional claims made to the cash strapped program, will affect the timing and scope of its renewal. trump on tuesday scrapped an obama era program known as deferred action for childhood arrivals, daca, that protects from deportation those who were brought illegally to the u.s. when they were children.  trump has delayed implementation of his decision for six months, saying it would give congress time to figure out a legislative fix that would affect almost 800,000 young people who participate in the program, known as dreamers. it is not yet clear whether congress will work to quickly pass a measure affecting the dreamers or pursue a larger scale overhaul of the immigration system. the chances that the republican led congress will continue making a priority of repealing and replacing former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law are slim after previous efforts ended in defeat. but important obamacare related deadlines loom. the trump administration has been making obamacare payments to insurers that reduce out of pocket costs for lower income americans on a month to month basis and must decide before the end of september whether to make october’s payment. if it does not, congress could step in to approve the payments with additional legislation. related to but not a part of obamacare is the children’s health insurance program, chip, a federal insurance program for millions of lower income children and pregnant women that requires congressional reauthorization by sept. 30. chip reauthorization is not typically contentious as the program receives bipartisan support. but lobbyists and industry officials have said any healthcare related legislation has become more complicated in the wake of the obamacare repeal and replace failure. trump kicked off the new legislative session’s tax reform effort on tuesday by inviting key republican leaders to the white house. an outline of the plan being developed could come as early as the week of sept. 11. senate republicans want to use a special process known as budget reconciliation to pass tax reform, because then they would only have to find a simple majority of 51 senators to pass it instead of the 60 votes that typically required in the 100 seat senate, where republicans hold 52 seats.  but to use this process, republicans will first have to pass a 2018 budget resolution, which they so far have been unable to do.

" prosecutors and tax authorities on tuesday raided the offices of several senior officials of volkswagen (vowg_p.de), the german car maker said. investigators searched the offices of supervisory board chairman hans dieter poetsch, finance chief frank witter, and human resources head karlheinz blessing, a volkswagen spokesman said. files and computers were seized. the raid was related to suspicions of overpayments for works council chief bernd osterloh, the spokesman said. osterloh s office was also searched.  neither the works council nor the prosecutor in braunschweig were immediately available for comment. a person with knowledge of the matter said the tax authorities were acting on suspicion of tax evasion. that is because over remuneration could result in overly high operating expenses and the payment of too little tax. it was revealed earlier that german prosecutors were investigating current and former executives at volkswagen on suspicion that they paid works council chief bernd osterloh an excessive salary.  in germany, wasting corporate funds is legally a breach of fiduciary duty.

" u.s. senator bernie sanders brought his strategy of trying to reenergize the democratic party by lending his star power to lower level races to a small city just outside boston on monday, with a stop to endorse candidates for alderman and city council. sanders, an independent who ran for the democratic party nomination in the 2016 presidential election, announced his support for a dozen candidates backed by “our revolution” a group formed by supporters of sanders’ campaign to boost progressive, liberal candidates. it is unusual for a politician with sanders’ profile to weigh in on races with no serious republican contenders, political observers said.   “the local level, more than any other level, is a way to involve people in the political process,” sanders said in  somerville, massachusetts, a city of 80,000 people. sanders last week pointed to the appearance as one of a series to try to build enthusiasm for lower level elections. sanders served four terms as mayor of burlington, vermont, before being elected to the senate. his remarks on monday mirrored his 2016 stump speeches, without directly addressing the candidates he was supporting in somerville and neighboring cambridge. political observers said sanders, and the candidates he endorsed, will face a challenge in translating the enthusiasm his campaign generated into votes for lower level races. in the city’s last municipal election that followed a presidential race, one in four registered voters, some 10,241 people, cast ballots. three out of four who voted in last year’s hillary clinton donald trump presidential matchup. “sanders envisioned his candidacy as a launching pad for nothing short of a revolution within the democratic party,” said jeffrey berry, a professor of political science at nearby tufts university. “the energy is more around ‘how do we fight trump’ than it is ‘how do we create a democratic party in the image of bernie sanders.’” sanders may not need to tip too many voters to influence the typically low turnout city races. in the 2013 ward races, just two candidates secured more than 1,000 votes and the four closest races were decided by an average of 166 votes. “it’s definitely a draw and i think it’s important that he is supporting local candidates,” said ellora derenoncourt, a 30 year old graduate student who was out to show her support for alderman candidate j.t. scott, a gym owner in his first race. the event did attract some undecided voters who said sanders’ endorsement would sway their picks among fields of democratic candidates. “our country has moved so far to their right since the mid 90s that just being a democrat doesn’t necessarily qualify you as a liberal or progressive,” said pamela massey, 59, of cambridge. nina turner, a former ohio state senator who serves as president of our revolution, acknowledged that the group faced a challenge in drumming up enthusiasm for down ticket races. “we have to try,” turner said. “we have to remind people that they have an obligation to participate and so often the level of vitriol that is put out the national level can have a negative effect.” ",0

" germany should be more assertive in setting foreign policy according to its own interests rather than to those of the united states, the german foreign minister said on tuesday.  traditionally close ties between berlin and washington have soured since u.s. president donald trump took office in january.   trump is at odds with germany over iran and north korea, has denounced germany s trade surplus with the united states, accused berlin and others of owing vast sums to nato and worried partners by deciding to ditch the paris climate accord. the traditional view of the united states as having a protecting role was beginning to  crumble , sigmar gabriel told an audience of politicians and government representatives at the koerber foundation.   the u.s. s retreat (from its international role) is not due to the policies of only one president. it will not change fundamentally after the next elections,  he said. germany should continue to invest in its partnership with the united states as a trading partner but must be more assertive in representing its own interests when the two countries are at odds. gabriel gave the example of sanctions against russia that the u.s. congress agreed on in the summer and which could ultimately affect germany s energy supply as they affect russian pipelines. gabriel also warned against ending the nuclear deal with iran, saying this would increase the risk of war and affect national security, and against any move by the united stales to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel.  germany cannot afford to wait for decisions from washington, or to merely react to them. we must lay out our own position and make clear to our allies where the limits of our solidarity are reached,  gabriel said in the speech, excerpts of which had been published by sueddeutsche zeitung ahead of time. germans see u.s. president donald trump as a bigger challenge for german foreign policy than authoritarian leaders in north korea, russia or turkey, a survey published by the koerber foundation showed. post war germany has pursued a cautious foreign policy embedded in the principles and institutions of the european union, due to the legacy of world war two but has gradually taken on a more active global role in the last decade or so. gabriel s social democrats (spd) have said they will launch talks with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives on forming a government next week if members of his center left party gave him the green light at a congress this weekend.

" indonesian authorities detained 22 people late on monday after a violent mob clashed with police at an anti communist protest in the capital jakarta. president joko widodo s government has tried to redress a bloody 1965 anti communist purge, one of the darkest periods in the country s history, but tensions remain over the purge in which an estimated 500,000 people were killed.  the public cannot take the law into their own hands, they must defer to law enforcement apparatus,  widodo said in a statement issued after the clashes. communism is banned in indonesia and any sympathizers are regarded with a deep suspicion and hostility, especially by nationalists and islamists.      five police were injured in the clashes when a mob of around 200 gathered outside the legal aid foundation in central jakarta, which had held a seminar on the 1965 killings at the weekend. protesters threw rocks and water bottles and police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd, according to media. activists called for authorities to safeguard such events and for the public to  look critically at history .  repressive attitudes and allowing anarchists to threaten people s rights will cripple our democracy,  the national commission for women s rights said in a statement.   there are victims of 1965 and the stigma associated with (communism) that deserve truth, justice, and healing.  the anti communist purge started in late 1965 after then general suharto and the military took power following an abortive communist coup. a million or more people were jailed, suspected of being communists. successive governments have refused to accept the estimated death toll figure and have refrained from apologizing.     the military, which is accused by activists of gross human rights violations during the 1965 purge, has bristled at any reconciliation efforts.  military chief gatot nurmantyo this year ordered a suharto era propaganda film to be screened for soldiers across the country to mark the anniversary of the abortive coup on sept 30, 1965, the night before the violence was unleashed.

" germany s greens said on monday that closing the country s 20 dirtiest coal fired power stations would be a key condition of any coalition with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives after this month s election. greens co leader cem ozdemir said he wanted to anchor the fight against climate change as the core  philosophy  of the next government, particularly given the backdrop of recent severe weather   from flooding in germany to drought in southern europe.  it is almost as if nature is trying to speak to us,  ozdemir told journalists on a solar powered boat anchored in berlin, which the greens planned to sail past merkel s office later in the day. polls show merkel s conservatives are likely to win the  sept. 24 election with around 38 percent of the vote but will need a coalition partner to govern, with options including a  jamaica coalition  of the conservatives, the greens and the liberal fdp. the greens, however, have raised doubts about the viability of such an alliance, as they would be reluctant to work with the fdp. ozdemir highlighted the gulf between these two parties, noting that a leading member of the fdp had branded links between recent extreme weather events and climate change as  fake news .   we will talk to everybody but not about everything,  ozdemir said of potential coalition negotiations. support for the greens is on 8 percent in the latest polls  but a forsa survey showed half of germans would welcome the greens being part of the new government. a study last week showed that germany is set to miss its goal to cut carbon dioxide (co2) emissions by a far wider margin than previously thought.  instead of being world champions in climate protection, we are world champions in lignite coal,  ozdemir said, noting that germany s co2 emissions have been rising for eight years. once dubbed the  climate chancellor  for pushing other wealthy nations to address climate change, merkel has come under fire for not moving germany fast enough to cut its reliance on fossil fuels as it phases out nuclear power.  merkel has suggested that germany should eventually consider phasing out lignate coal power plants to help it cut co2 emissions, but she is treading carefully as the move could hit tens of thousands of jobs. ozdemir said the greens would demand that any government it joins must allot 1 billion euros ($1.2 bln) a year to improve public transport and cycle paths, and should push for improved co2 emissions trading at a european level.

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri indicated on wednesday that he might withdraw his resignation next week, saying matters were  positive  and he would rescind his decision if they remained so, a statement from his press office said. hariri announced his resignation in a televised statement while he was in saudi arabia on nov. 4, prompting a political crisis in lebanon and thrusting it back into a regional tussle between riyadh and its main regional foe, iran. lebanese officials say saudi arabia coerced hariri, a long time ally of saudi arabia, into resigning and held him there against his will until an intervention by france led to his return to lebanon last week. saudi arabia denies this. hariri agreed to shelve the decision after meeting aoun last week, saying this was to allow for dialogue. hariri wants all lebanese to commit to staying out of regional conflicts, a reference to the powerful armed shi ite group hezbollah, which saudi arabia accuses of sowing strife in the arab world with support from iran.  matters are positive, as you hear, and if this positivity continues we will announce, god willing, to lebanese next week with president michel aoun and parliament speaker nabih berri the withdrawal of the resignation,  hariri said on wednesday. he was speaking during a celebration to mark the prophet mohammad s birthday. earlier on wednesday, aoun was quoted as saying that hariri would  certainly  remain prime minister and lebanon s political crisis will be resolved in a few days.  we have just finished talks with all the political forces, within and outside government. there is a broad agreement,  the newspaper la stampa quoted him as saying during a visit to italy. aoun did not accept hariri s televised resignation, accusing saudi arabia of holding hariri in riyadh and forcing him to step down. hariri eventually returned to beirut on nov. 22 and postponed his resignation. he said on monday that he would stay on as prime minister if iran s lebanese ally, hezbollah, accepted a policy of staying out of regional conflicts. asked about that demand, aoun   a hezbollah ally   said:  hezbollah has fought against islamic state terrorists in lebanon and abroad. but when the war against terrorism is finished, their fighters will come back to the country,  la stampa reported. the group has fought alongside president bashar al assad s forces in syria against rebels seeking to oust him, including factions that were backed by saudi arabia.

"according to a nationwide poll, as many as 2 million non-citizen hispanics are illegally registered to vote in the u.s.just facts president james d. agresti told the washington times:  contrary to the claims of certain major media outlets and fact checkers, a comprehensive analysis of polling data, election records and government investigations shows that many noncitizens vote illegally in u.s. elections, in light of these alarming findings, president trump has announced that he will be putting together a task force headed by vice president mike pence to look into the allegations of voter fraud which will focus on inaccurate voter registration.a largely ignored national hispanic survey executed by mclaughlin and associates in 2013 polled u.s. resident latinos. the poll s section on voter profiles showed that of the randomly selected sample of 800 hispanics, 56 percent, or 448 were non-citizens, and of those 13 percent said they were registered to vote. the poll did not ask if the non-citizen registered voters had actually voted, presumably because it was made a felony to vote as a non-citizen in 1996.white house adviser stephen miller told abc news:  it is a fact and you will not deny it, that there are massive numbers of non-citizens in this country who are registered to vote. that is a scandal. we should stop the presses. hopefully, the president s task force will be able to prevent any more of the roughly 8.3 million non-citizen adults living in the u.s. from registering to vote.(source: washington times)",1
" the u.s. state department will not conduct its regular daily press briefing until a new secretary of state is confirmed, leaving the main u.s. agency responsible for dealing with the rest of the world silent amid the uproar over president donald trump’s executive order on immigration. trump on friday announced a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and a temporary bar on travelers from seven muslim majority countries. the decision provoked a widespread backlash in foreign capitals, documented in cables u.s. embassies sent to washington. typically, in the aftermath of a major foreign policy shift, a state department spokesperson would appear on camera within days to take questions from reporters and defend or explain the u.s. positions on different issues. the state department has not briefed since the day before trump’s jan. 20 inauguration, however, and on monday a department spokesperson said no one will appear at the podium until the u.s. senate confirms a new secretary of state. “at that point, we will update the press corps on our posture,” the spokesperson said. trump’s desire to break with previous u.s. policies on issues including israel’s construction of settlements, u.s. trade pacts, and cooperation with russia suggests that state department officials have not been given guidance on what positions they should articulate.     “until you know what policy you’re advancing, it doesn’t do you any good to get out there,” said richard boucher, a former state department spokesman who briefed reporters on the first weekday of the george w. bush administration, in january 2001. “the decision not to brief is a simple admission that they don’t know what to say.” the senate is due to vote on monday on moving forward on confirming rex tillerson, the former exxon mobil corp executive whom trump has tapped to lead the state department.   if as expected the senate votes to advance his nomination, a final confirmation vote would most likely take place late on tuesday. the lack of briefings this far into a new administration is a departure from the three previous inter party transitions. in 1993, 2001, and 2009, state department spokespeople briefed reporters no later than jan. 23, according to briefing transcripts stored in online archives. in those three transitions, the new secretary of state was confirmed on or just after jan. 20.

" president donald trump had personal liabilities of at least $315.6 million to german, u.s. and other lenders as of mid 2017, according to a federal financial disclosure form released late on friday by the u.s. office of government ethics. he had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the white house last september. revenues also increased at mar a lago, the florida resort known as the “winter white house.” trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0zm) the 98 page disclosure document posted on the ethics office’s  website showed liabilities for trump of at least $130 million to deutsche bank trust company americas [dbkgk.ul], a unit of german based deutsche bank ag. for example, trump disclosed a liability to deutsche exceeding $50 million for the old post office, a historic washington property where he has opened a hotel.  trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to ladder capital corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in new york, los angeles and boca raton, florida. the largest component of trump’s income was $115.9 million listed as golf resort related revenues from trump national doral in miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. revenue from trump corporation, his real estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from mar a lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. the private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after trump’s election. he earned $11 million from the miss universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.  revenue from television shows like “the apprentice” fell to $1.1 million, down from $6 million a year earlier. his assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. the document showed trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming u.s. president. his tenure in most of those posts ended on jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. most of the entities involved were based in the united states, with a handful in scotland, ireland, canada, brazil, bermuda and elsewhere. trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. but he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family’s income, assets and liabilities. “president trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,” the white house said in a statement, adding that the form was “certified by the office of government ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.” an office of government ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. trump released a disclosure form in may 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. some critics disputed that figure as overblown. before taking office in january, trump was a new york real estate developer and television celebrity.

" u.s. senate negotiators on wednesday tried to reach a deal to provide more than $1 billion to battle the zika virus that is feared will creep north into the united states with the onset of warmer weather, which breeds mosquitoes that could carry the disease. senior senate democratic aides said details were still being worked out, but votes could come by next week on whether to approve the new money. in february, president barack obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funds, but republicans balked, with some arguing that $1.1 billion is more in line with what is needed. many republicans also want any zika funds to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere. these are among the details that still have to be worked out, according to aides. republican senator roy blunt from missouri and democratic senator patty murray from washington, the two senior senators on an appropriations panel that oversees healthcare spending, have been trying to hammer out a deal. an aide to murray said in a statement: “senator murray is having conversations with chairman blunt and others about the path forward on emergency funding to respond to zika.” the aide said murray still supports obama’s $1.9 billion request. amid congressional inaction, the obama administration shifted $589 million to help federal agencies prepare for zika. most of that money came from a fund to fight the ebola virus and will have to be replenished, according to officials. senator marco rubio, however, is one republican pushing for both immediate, emergency funding and longer term money to be made available starting on oct. 1 to battle the disease that can cause severe brain deformities in babies born of infected mothers and other illnesses. “this is going to be an ongoing issue beyond this year,” rubio said, adding, “we need to jump on it now.” there are fears that rubio’s home state of florida could be the first place in the continental united states to get hit hard by zika because of its tropical climate. “for the first time, i’ve seen high level conversations about a way forward here in the senate and that’s a positive development,” rubio said in a brief hallway interview with reuters. republicans in the house of representatives are still deeply divided over new funding for zika, according to two senior aides.",0

" rohingya refugees in bangladesh could die due to a lack of  food, shelter and water, given the huge numbers fleeing violence in myanmar, an aid agency warned on sunday, as authorities began moving people to camps to streamline the distribution of help. nearly 410,000 members of the rohingya muslim minority fled from myanmar s western rakhine state to bangladesh to escape a military offensive that the united nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,  mark pierce, bangladesh country director for the save the children aid agency said in a statement.  i m particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. if families can t meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.  bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of rohingya fleeing persecution in buddhist majority myanmar, where the rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants. bangladesh was already home to 400,000 rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp in the western state of rakhine, killing a dozen people. pierce said the humanitarian response needed to be rapidly scaled up.  that can only be done if the international community steps up funding,  he said. rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say myanmar security forces and rakhine buddhist vigilantes responded to the aug. 25 insurgent attacks with what they say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the muslim population. myanmar rejects that, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army, which claimed responsibility for the august attacks and similar, smaller, raids in october. the myanmar government has declared the group a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. bangladesh border guards said the flow of refugees leaving myanmar had eased off over the past day, apparently because bad weather had discouraged people from taking to boats to reach bangladesh.  heavy rain has turned roads into mud, with refugees huddling under shelters of bamboo and plastic sheets beside them. bangladeshi authorities said they had started moving an estimated 100,000 rohingya living by the roads to camps designated as aid points.  we re not allowing any distribution to anyone from the side of the road,  said district government official kazi abdur rahman.  we want to convince them there s everything in the camp and nothing here.  a big new camp is planned but it is unclear how long it would take to build.  people are living in these muddy, awful conditions. you have to get them to some sort of space where aid can be delivered,  said chris lom of the international organization for migration.   clean water and sanitation can only be delivered in a structured environment.  there is no sign that violence has stopped in myanmar, with smoke, apparently from burning villages, seen as recently as friday, meaning more refugees are likely to cross. human rights watch said satellite imagery showed 62 rohingya villages had been torched since the violence erupted. myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, and about 30,000 non muslim villagers have been displaced.  myanmar government leader and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. the military remains in full control of security policy and there is little sympathy for the rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities, and the military campaign in rakhine state is widely supported. suu kyi is due to make her first address to the nation on the crisis on tuesday. her foreign supporters and western governments that backed her campaign against military rule, and see her as the best hope for myanmar s future, will be hoping to see her make a commitment to protect the rights of the muslim minority. suu kyi s supporters at home could be disappointed if she is perceived to be caving in to foreign pressure and taking the side of a muslim minority blamed for initiating the violence. the united states has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state, patrick murphy, is due in myanmar this week. he will travel to sittwe, the capital of rakhine state, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern rakhine state. the military has called for unity on the issue. the political party founded by retired officers and trounced by suu kyi s party in the 2015 election, could be expected to take heart to see her support eroded by the crisis.

" a bill to send $700 million to cash starved social services providers breezed through the illinois legislature on thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget. the measure passed the house 111 0 and the senate 56 0. there was no immediate comment from governor bruce rauner’s office on whether he will sign it into law. a memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs. democratic state representative greg harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of illinois’ general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget. “this is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most,” he said. despite the stalemate between the republican governor and democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a k 12 school bill, and court ordered spending. but some parts of the government were left out in the cold. earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued illinois, seeking more than $100 million. andrea durbin, chairman of the pay now illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation. “it could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but it’s not a comprehensive solution for the pay now illinois plaintiffs,” she said. in april, the legislature passed and rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on july 1. illinois is the only u.s. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. rauner earlier on thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. that framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports.  “i’m cheering for bipartisan general assembly members to come up with some solutions,” the governor told reporters.

" u.s. president barack obama and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull pledged on tuesday to increase cooperation on counterterrorism and the fight against islamic state. obama praised australia for its support in afghanistan and thanked the prime minister for his country’s troops’ sacrifices around the world. “we’re going to talk about how we can strengthen our cooperation both in syria and iraq, the state of affairs in afghanistan, but also countering violent extremism globally,” obama told reporters in the oval office at the start of the meeting. “australia will be a very important partner in that process,” he said. turnbull said it was critical to improve efforts to fight islamic state. “we have to constantly lift our game in the way we engage with and tackle these extremists, particularly isil   but there are many others   as they operate in the cyber sphere,” he said, referring to islamic state with an acronym. “archaic and barbaric though they may be, their use regrettably of the internet is very sophisticated. and so i’m pleased that we’re going to be working on even closer collaboration there.” the two leaders also discussed their backing of the trans pacific partnership trade pact. “it is going to be good for our economy. it is going to be good for our workers and our businesses, and it reaffirms that in order for us to thrive in the 21st century ... it’s important for us to be making the rules in this region, and that’s exactly what tpp does,” obama said. turnbull congratulated obama on the implementation of the iran nuclear deal.

" representatives of syria s warring sides sat just meters apart in separate rooms at u.n. peace talks on thursday, but mediator staffan de mistura stopped short of bringing them together in what diplomats had hoped might be a minor breakthrough. previous rounds of talks have gone almost nowhere, with de mistura shuttling between hotels and meeting multiple delegations separately. a newly unified opposition had raised the possibility of face to face talks to speed up the talks. although the two delegations were in the u.n. building concurrently, de mistura kept them apart, dashing between their respective meeting rooms on either side of a corridor.   we are having what we would call close proximity parallel meetings,  he told the opposition team, after making similar comments to the government delegation, promising to leave them in the hands of his deputy while he went to meet their enemies. after several hours of talks, chief government negotiator bashar al ja afari and his opposition counterpart nasr hariri left separately, without commenting to the media. hariri told reuters on wednesday that he was ready for direct talks and was prepared to negotiate with no preconditions to end the six year war. he said his first words to ja afari would be:  despite all of the crimes which have been done in syria, i hope that the regime can come ready to put the people of syria first.  if the two sides do meet, it will not be their first time in the same room. in february, de mistura infuriated ja afari by inviting both sides to a ceremony to inaugurate the talks.   on that occasion, as de mistura warmly embraced the opposition delegates, whom the government of president bashar al assad regards as terrorists, ja afari and his team walked out of the room without turning back. one western diplomat predicted fireworks if the two sides sat down to talk at last, almost seven years into syria s war, but he said the  sponsor  countries backing the talks   including russia and the united states   would then force them back to the table, and the pressure would gradually be released. a european diplomat expected the opposition to be  pragmatic and flexible  but there was little chance of a big breakthrough.   i think we need baby steps, and we ve made such little progress in the years gone by, largely because of the regime s reluctance to engage in this, so to make some small steps now and develop some momentum would be very helpful indeed.  hundreds of thousands of people have died in syria s civil war and more than 11 million have been driven from their homes. previous rounds of talks have faltered over the opposition s demand that assad leave power and his refusal to go. over the past two years, since russia joined the war on the government side, assad and his allies have recaptured all major towns and cities from the rebels. there has been some speculation ahead of this week s round of talks that the opposition could soften its demands in light of the government s success on the battlefield. however, at a meeting before the talks began, opposition delegates stuck by their demand that assad be excluded from any transitional government under a future peace deal.

" a man suspected of carrying out a knife attack in the french city of marseille, in which two women were stabbed to death, had been arrested and then released by police the day before the incident, the paris public prosecutor said on monday. the prosecutor, francois molins, told a news conference that the suspect, who was shot dead by a french soldier, went by seven different identities. one such identity named him as  ahmed h , born in 1987 in tunisia. he had shown a tunisian passport when last stopped by police in the city of lyon on sept. 29 on suspicion of robbery. he was subsequently released by police for lack of evidence on sept. 30, the day before sunday s attack.  the attacker had been pointed out on seven different times since 2005, under seven different identities. the last time, on september 29, related to an arrest in lyon over shoplifting,  molins told a news conference. molins said none of the suspect s seven different identities had thrown up any alert on french anti terrorist check lists. the authorities were trying now to establish his real name and the authenticity of the tunisian passport he had shown. police sources said the suspect had shouted  allahu akbar  (god is greatest) in arabic as he attacked the women at marseille s main railway station on sunday, in what officials described as a  probable terrorist act . the militant islamic state group claimed responsibility for the attack but did not name the assailant. molins did not confirm or deny any suspected involvement by islamic state. molins added that the suspect had told police he lived in lyon, was homeless, divorced and had problems with drug abuse. the assailant was shot dead by a soldier from the military sentinelle patrol, a force deployed across the country under a state of emergency declared after islamist militant attacks began almost two years ago. multiple attacks by militants killed 130 people in paris in 2015. in 2016 a gunman drove a truck into a crowd celebrating bastille day in nice, killing 86 people. both of these attacks were claimed by islamic state.

" a group of states renewed their effort on monday to block president donald trump’s revised temporary ban on refugees and travelers from several muslim majority countries, arguing that his executive order is the same as the first one that was halted by federal courts. court papers filed by the state of washington and joined by california, maryland, massachusetts, new york and oregon asked a judge to stop the march 6 order from taking effect on thursday. an amended complaint said the order was similar to the original jan. 27 directive because it “will cause severe and immediate harms to the states, including our residents, our colleges and universities, our healthcare providers, and our businesses.” a department of justice spokeswoman said it was reviewing the complaint and would respond to the court.  a more sweeping ban implemented hastily in january caused chaos and protests at airports. the march order by contrast gave 10 days’ notice to travelers and immigration officials. last month, u.s. district judge james robart in seattle halted the first travel ban after washington state sued, claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the u.s. constitution. robart’s order was upheld by the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals. trump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking iraq off the list of countries covered. the new order still halts citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen from entering the united states for 90 days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country. refugees are still barred for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria. washington state has now gone back to robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban.   robart said in a court order monday that the government has until tuesday to respond to the states’ motions. he said he would not hold a hearing before wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides.   separately, hawaii has also sued over the new ban. the island state, which is heavily dependent on tourism, said the executive order has had a “chilling effect” on travel revenues. in response to hawaii’s lawsuit, the department of justice in court papers filed on monday said the president has broad authority to “restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest.” the department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks. there is a hearing in the hawaii case set for wednesday, the day before the new ban is set to go into effect.  the first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving “standing,” which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. with so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue, in the eyes of a court. to overcome this challenge, the states filed more than 70 declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses amazon and expedia, which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees.  universities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in, as did religious organizations and individual residents, including u.s. citizens, with stories about separated families. but the trump administration in its filings in the hawaii case on monday said the carve outs in the new order undercut the state’s standing claims. “the order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa, and even as to them, it sets forth robust waiver provisions,” the department of justice’s motion said.  the government cited supreme court precedent in arguing that people outside the united states and seeking admission for the first time have “no constitutional rights” regarding their applications. if the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue, the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against muslims.  “the trump administration may have changed the text of the now discredited muslim travel ban, but they didn’t change its unconstitutional intent and effect,” california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement on monday. while the text of the order does not mention islam, the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is trump’s campaign promise of “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” he later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of “extreme vetting” of foreigners coming to the united states. the government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by trump or his aides.

" china’s state news agency xinhua described u.s. president donald trump’s decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord as a “global setback” and rejected trump’s claim that it would lead to many more jobs in america. in a commentary published on friday, xinhua suggested that no one country was now likely take up leadership of global efforts to fight climate change. china overtook the united states as the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007 but analysts see the u.s. withdrawal as an opportunity for china to burnish its image as a global leader. “trump’s decision to ditch the paris deal will leave a fairly big shoe for a single country to fill,” xinhua said, adding that major players such as china, the european union and india had reiterated their willingness to step up efforts. leaving the 2015 paris accord would hardly translate into a substantial increase in new jobs as the fossil fuel industries were highly automated, xinhua said. noting that trump said he had had “extensive discussions” with people on both sides of the climate debate, it said: “one can only assume that trump has very good reasons to leave the paris agreement, and that he knows the implications of u.s. retreat from the landmark deal”. trump, tapping into the “america first” message he used when he was elected president last year, said the paris accord would undermine the u.s. economy, cost u.s. jobs, weaken american national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other countries such as china. the global times, an influential state run tabloid, said in an editorial published on thursday before trump’s announcement that china was not interested in discussions about the leadership of fighting climate change and would focus on its own promises to reduce emissions. it called the withdrawal “reckless” and would “waste  increasingly finite u.s. diplomatic resources.” “there are indeed some underprivileged people in the u.s, but their troubles are mainly caused by bad internal governance. seeking external reasons for domestic woes is by no means what the world’s largest economy should do,” it said.

" israeli officials welcomed on friday what they took as u.s. consent to expand existing settlements, after the white house reversed a long standing policy of condemning building on occupied land. in its first substantive announcement on the israeli palestinian conflict, the trump administration said it did not see existing settlements hampering peace with the palestinians, although it recognized that “expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.” at one level, that appeared to be an attempt to rein in prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who has announced wide ranging settlement expansion plans since the jan. 20 inauguration, including around 6,000 new homes. but on closer reading, the statement was a softening of policy from the obama administration and even that of george w. bush, because it does not view settlements as an obstacle to peace or rule out their expansion within existing blocs. “netanyahu will be happy,” a senior israeli diplomat said in a text message. “pretty much carte blanche to build as much as we want in existing settlements as long as we don’t enlarge their physical acreage. no problem there.” israel’s deputy foreign minister, tzipi hotovely from the right wing of netanyahu’s likud party, interpreted it in a similar way, saying construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem, which the palestinians want for their own state together with gaza, would go on unhindered. “it is also the opinion of the white house that settlements are not an obstacle to peace and, indeed, they have never been an obstacle to peace,” she said. “therefore, the conclusion is that more building is not the problem.” israel seized the west bank and east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war. the 50th anniversary of the occupation, which israel marks as a reunification of jerusalem, is in june.  there was no immediate comment from the palestinians. since taking office, president trump has largely kept quiet on the israeli palestinian issue, making no comment in response to netanyahu’s announcements for thousands more settler homes, a silence interpreted as endorsement. during the campaign, trump said he would not interfere or push israel to negotiate on a two state solution to the conflict. he has nominated david friedman as ambassador to israel, a religious jew who has raised money for the settlements and supports moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem. trump supported that idea during the election campaign, but it has been put on the back burner in recent weeks. under barack obama, the white house maintained a firm anti settlements line, calling them illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. most of the world considers settlements illegal under international law, a position israel rejects. the european union and britain issued statements this week criticizing netanyahu’s settlement plans, which they see as further breaking up the west bank and undermining the possibility of a contiguous palestinian state ever emerging. netanyahu, who will visit trump in washington on feb. 15, may see the white house statement as doubly beneficial. as well as not ruling out building within existing blocs, which israel hopes to retain in any final agreement with the palestinians, it may allow him to silence far right voices in his own coalition calling for much greater settlement growth and annexation of parts of the west bank.  trump has effectively set a limit on how far ranging settlement building can be, so netanyahu will be able to tell the far right their ambitions are out of the question. at the same time, netanyahu may have to curtail some of the plans he himself has announced in recent days. while most of the 6,000 settler homes he has promised are in existing blocs, many are not and may have to be scrapped if he wants to adhere to the white house line. he may also have to rethink a pledge this week to build the first new west bank settlement since the 1990s.

" cambodian prime minister hun sen said on monday it was  a fact  that the main opposition party would be dissolved as he spoke on the anniversary of the peace agreement that established multiparty democracy. more than 50 rights groups called on the countries that signed the paris peace agreements in 1991 to reconvene urgently because of the threat to democracy in the southeast asian country. hun sen s government has asked the supreme court to dissolve the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) after its leader, kem sokha, was arrested on sept. 3 and charged with treason. the court has yet to rule on whether the cnrp will be dissolved.  because they didn t respect the paris peace agreement, the political party will be dissolved in the future, this is a fact,  hun sen said at a ceremony marking the construction of a new bridge in phnom penh. dissolving the party would eliminate the challenge to him prolonging more than 32 years in power in next year s election, but western donors have criticized the move and called for the release of kem sokha. hun sen accused the united nations of failing to bring peace despite organizing the first election in 1993 and said guerrilla fighting had only ended because of his own negotiations with leaders of the genocidal khmer rouge. hun sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one party state for the ruling cambodian people s party (cpp). on sunday, he said any elected officials who defect from the cnrp to his party would be allowed to keep their positions once the opposition party is dissolved. in a joint open letter on monday, more than 50 rights groups called for the paris conference on cambodia to be reconvened.  there is an urgent need for decisive action from the international community, to ensure that the democratic vision for cambodia outlined in the paris peace agreements is not completely forsaken,  said the letter. hun sen said calls for the original signatories to be reconvened were  out of date and impossible . he noted that one of the signatories, the soviet union, no longer exists. in the face of the western criticism since the arrest of kem sokha, china has given verbal support to hun sen s government. china is by far the biggest donor to cambodia and its biggest investor. china s influential global times tabloid said in an editorial on sunday that cambodia s  growth trend should not be interrupted by the country s rising political tension .  as an important economic partner of cambodia, china will pay close attention to the situation in the southeast asian country and willingly provide the necessary help,  it said.

" daimler ag’s mercedes benz usa and daimler vans units and ferrari nv are among a small group of automakers selling some new vehicles with faulty takata airbags that will be subject to recalls by the end of 2018, a u.s. senate report said on wednesday. the vehicles are legal to sell since the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) has said they will not become potentially unsafe until exposed to high humidity for an extended period. safety advocates and some in congress have criticized the sale of vehicles that will be recalled. senator bill nelson, a florida democrat, said the vehicles include the 2016 mercedes benz sprinter and 2016 2017 mercedes benz e class coupe/convertible and numerous 2016 and 2017 ferrari models including the ff, california t, 488 gtb/488 spider, f12/f12tdf and gtc4 lusso. nelson said the report underscores “the failure of certain automakers and regulators to level with people about the true extent of the problem and to have the cars fixed before they’re sold.” mercedes benz usa spokeswoman donna boland said the company has told regulators that its “dealers will be informing prospective buyers of the pending recall on these models at the time of purchase in the very near future.” ferrari spokeswoman krista florin said the italian automaker also plans to notify customers of the future recalls.seven out of 17 automakers nelson contacted have admitted to equipping some new vehicles with defective takata airbags, including toyota motor corp (7203.t), fiat chrysler automobiles nv (fcha.mi) and volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de). all agreed to notify buyers of the planned recalls. tesla motors inc (tsla.o) is the only automaker that has not provided a written response, nelson said. tesla did not respond to a request for comment on wednesday from reuters. nhtsa said in may tesla would be required to recall vehicles for takata inflators. takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. they are suspected in at least 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries. in may, takata agreed to declare as defective, by 2018, another 35 million to 40 million u.s. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags after 14 automakers previously recalled more than 24 million u.s. vehicles. worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective. nhtsa said there have been no ruptures in vehicles built since 2008. according to nhtsa, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long term exposure to high humidity. in the short term, the agency says, they are safe to drive and much safer than older models.

" u.s. senate republicans were expected to vote on tuesday for opening debate on a healthcare bill without knowing what is in it, but the potential components of the legislation were clear.  approaches hammered out by republicans in recent months were expected to be in the mix, with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell making key choices about what is in and what is out, based on how much support a given combination can attract. one bill he could introduce would repeal much of obamacare with no replacement plan. another bill could repeal and replace the 2010 law while also overhauling medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. both bills have faced criticism from the health industry.  the affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, extended insurance to 20 million americans and was democratic former president barack obama’s signature domestic achievement. for seven years, republicans have promised to repeal and replace it, but have struggled to do so, even though they now control both chambers of congress and the white house. another path open to mcconnell would be to develop an entirely new bill on the senate floor through amendments. here are summaries of bills that could be in play: a shortened version of obamacare repeal, called a “skinny repeal,” could end obamacare’s individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax, said a senate aide and a lobbyist. senate republicans would likely go for a bare minimum “skinny repeal” only if other approaches, such as those below, cannot win approval. mcconnell has said he could introduce a bill that republicans passed in 2015 that was subsequently vetoed by obama, called the obamacare repeal reconciliation act. it would repeal most obamacare taxes and end funding for obamacare’s medicaid expansion, as well as tax credits that help low income people buy health insurance on the individual insurance market. it would abolish a penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance, as well as a penalty on certain employers who do not provide employees insurance. but the legislation does not include a replacement plan. if signed into law, congress would have two years to craft and pass a replacement. the nonpartisan congressional budget office (cbo) estimated the law would increase the number of uninsured americans by 17 million in 2018, and by 32 million in 2026. the senate has spent months negotiating a bill, called the better care reconciliation act, that would repeal and replace much of obamacare, while also drastically cutting medicaid. the latest version would repeal many obamacare taxes, but retain two taxes on the wealthy. it would unwind obamacare’s medicaid expansion over three years, then slash spending on medicaid beginning in 2025, as well as overhaul the law’s tax credits. it would also eliminate penalties on individuals for not purchasing insurance and employers who do not provide it. the bill includes an amendment from senator ted cruz that would let insurers sell bare bones policies that fall short of broad benefits mandated under obamacare, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs. the cbo estimated the bill would result in 22 million more people losing their insurance by 2026 and, in a separate report, estimated that medicaid would be cut by 35 percent come 2036.  house passed legislation in may, the house of representatives passed its own version of healthcare legislation, called the american health care act.  it would repeal most obamacare taxes, including taxes on the wealthy, replace the law’s income based tax credits with flat age based credits capped at upper income levels and end funding for the medicaid expansion beginning in 2020.  like the senate legislation, it would eliminate the penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance and employers who do not provide it to employees. controversially, the house bill would eliminate the obamacare mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. the cbo found it would result in 23 million more uninsured americans by 2026 and destabilize the individual insurance market in much of the country.

" president elect donald trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the united states from a global accord to combat climate change, a source on his transition team said, defying broad global backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. since trump’s election victory on tuesday, governments ranging from china to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 paris agreement during climate talks involving 200 nations set to run until friday in marrakesh, morocco. trump has called global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the paris agreement, which was strongly supported by outgoing democratic u.s. president barack obama. trump’s advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four year procedure for leaving the accord, according to the source, who works on trump’s transition team for international energy and climate policy. “it was reckless for the paris agreement to enter into force before the election” on tuesday, the source told reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. the paris accord won enough backing for entry into force on nov. 4, four days before the election. u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on sunday in new zealand the obama administration would do everything it could to implement the paris accord before trump takes office. the accord says in its article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after signing on has to wait four years. in theory, the earliest date for withdrawal would be nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next u.s. presidential election. the source said the future trump administration is weighing alternatives to accelerate the pull out: sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the paris agreement; voiding u.s. involvement in both in a year’s time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the u.s. signature from the paris accord. withdrawing from the u.n. framework convention on climate change (unfccc) would be controversial, partly because it was signed by former republican president george h.w. bush in 1992 and approved by the u.s. senate. the action also could antagonize many other countries. [l8n1db41l] the unfccc sets a goal of avoiding “dangerous” man made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels. the 2015 paris agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees celsius (3.6 fahrenheit) above pre industrial times. many nations have expressed hope that the united states will stay. but the host of the current round of climate negotiations, morocco, said the pact that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout. one party deciding to withdraw would not call the agreement into question, foreign minister salaheddine mezouar told a news conference. in beijing on monday, the foreign ministry spokesman, geng shuang, told a regular news briefing that china would like to continue working with all countries, including the united states, in the global fight against climate change.  the agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in december and, as of saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, including the united states with 18 percent. the accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels. u.n. climate chief patricia espinosa declined to comment on the trump source’s remarks to reuters. “the paris agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility,” espinosa told a news conference. she said the united nations hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with trump. the trump source said the president elect’s transition team is aware of the likely international backlash but said republicans in the u.s. congress have given ample warning that a republican administration would take action to reverse course. “the republican party on multiple occasions has sent signals to the international community signaling that it doesn’t agree with the pact. we’ve gone out of our way to give notice,” the source said. the source blamed obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the u.s. senate. “there wouldn’t be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if obama hadn’t rushed the adoption,” the source said.

" u.s. president donald trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe agreed in a telephone conversation on wednesday that pressure should be maintained on north korea, a senior japanese government official told reporters. the two men also agreed that  dialogue for the purpose of dialogue  was meaningless,  the official said. in recent weeks north korea has launched two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said last weekend that washington was directly communicating with pyongyang on its nuclear and missile programs but that pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. trump later dismissed any prospect of talks with north korea as a waste of time.     during the 12 minute telephone conversation, abe also offered condolences over the mass shooting in las vegas, and told trump that japan was  100 percent  behind the american people. trump will be traveling to japan, china, south korea, vietnam and the philippines next month.

" north korea displayed trademark defiance on wednesday over new united nations sanctions imposed after its sixth and largest ever nuclear test, vowing to redouble efforts to fight off what it said was the threat of a u.s. invasion. u.s. president donald trump said the sanctions, unanimously agreed on monday by the 15 member u.n. security council, were just a small step toward what is ultimately needed to rein in pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. north korea s foreign ministry said the resolutions were an infringement on its legitimate right to self defense and aimed at  completely suffocating its state and people through full scale economic blockade .  the dprk will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country s sovereignty and right to existence and to preserve peace and security of the region by establishing the practical equilibrium with the u.s.,  it said in a statement carried by the official kcna news agency. the democratic people s republic of korea (dprk) is north korea s official name. the statement echoed comments on tuesday by dprk s ambassador to the united nations in geneva, han tae song, who said pyongyang was  ready to use a form of ultimate means .  the forthcoming measures ... will make the u.s. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  han said. the north s rodong sinmun newspaper also accused south korea of being washington s  puppet , criticizing seoul s agreement with the united states to amend an existing bilateral guideline that will now allow the south to use unlimited warhead payloads on its missiles. the u.n. security council agreed to tighten sanctions on north korea, banning its textile exports and capping fuel supplies, and making it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with north korean entities. the u.n. resolution was triggered by north korea s test of what it said was a hydrogen bomb. damage to mountainous terrain at the north s nuclear test site in punggye ri seen in satellite imagery taken after the latest test was more extensive than anything seen after the five previous tests, said 38 north, a washington based project which monitors north korea. there was also activity at another location in the mount mantap site involving large vehicles and mining equipment that suggests  onsite work could now be changing focus to further prepare those other portals for future underground nuclear testing , 38 north said. the north accuses the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea, a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, of continual plans for invasion. north korea has also tested a missile capable of reaching the united states, but experts say it is likely to be at least a year before it can field an operational nuclear missile that could threaten the u.s. mainland. a u.s. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said intelligence agencies had observed north korea moving a mobile missile launcher in the past 48 hours which could potentially indicate a possible missile launch by the north in the coming days. the official did not comment on the location or the type of missile, but emphasized that while a launch was possible, north korea could simply be moving the launcher. trump has vowed not to allow that to happen. a tougher initial u.s. draft resolution was weakened to win the support of china and russia, both of which hold veto power on the u.n. security council. significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to north korea, most of which come from china.  we think it s just another very small step, not a big deal,  trump told reporters at the start of a tuesday meeting with malaysian prime minister najib razak.  i don t know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15 to nothing vote, but those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin also warned china, north korea s main ally and trading partner, that washington would  put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the u.s. and international dollar system  if it did not follow through on the new measures. another senior administration official told reuters that any such  secondary sanctions  on chinese banks and other companies were on hold for now to give beijing time to show it was prepared to fully enforce the latest and previous rounds of sanctions. washington has so far mostly held off on new sanctions against chinese banks and other companies doing business with north korea, given fears of retaliation by beijing and possibly far reaching effects on the world economy. russia and china both say they respect u.n. sanctions and have called on the united states to return to negotiations with north korea. they have also said they could kick start talks with north korea if the united states halts joint military drills with south korea, which washington has rejected. an article carried on the front page of the people s daily, the official paper of china s ruling communist party, said the korean peninsula had reached the  moment of choice  where the united states and north korea must break from the cycle of nuclear tests and sanctions.   all parties involved in the peninsula have their own strategic considerations, but not being able to see beyond this vicious cycle is not in anyone s interest,  the article said. asked about the north korean and u.s. rhetoric, china s foreign ministry reiterated a call for restraint and a return to dialogue.   we hope all relevant parties can be rational and maintain restraint and not take actions that could further increase tensions on the peninsula , ministry spokesman geng shuang said at a regular briefing.  in another show of force, south korea s air force conducted its first live fire exercise of taurus long range, air to surface missiles on tuesday, the defence ministry said, as practice for precision bombing north korean facilities. u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said the new sanctions could eventually starve north korea of an additional $500 million or more in annual revenue. the united states has said that a previous round of sanctions agreed in august was aimed at cutting north korea s $3 billion in exports by a third.

" the chairman of a u.s. house committee that oversees child abuse issues opened an inquiry friday into whether the federal government is failing to enforce a law meant to protect thousands of babies born dependent on drugs each year. the inquiry, launched by representative john kline of minnesota, comes in response to a reuters investigation last month that identified 110 examples of children who were exposed to opioids while in the womb and later died preventable deaths after leaving the hospital. no more than nine states comply with a 2003 law that calls on hospitals to alert social workers whenever a baby is born dependent on drugs, the news agency found. since the law was enacted, the number of newborns diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome has skyrocketed – from 4,991 cases in 2003 to 27,315 in 2013, federal data show. a reuters analysis found that thousands of drug dependant newborns are sent home each year without a referral to social service agencies, contrary to the intent of the federal law. those referrals are intended to help social workers develop a “plan of safe care” for the newborns and mothers. although most states fail to comply with the provisions, reuters found none has lost federal funding. in a letter friday, kline told health and human services secretary sylvia burwell that he was “deeply concerned” that the agency may not be enforcing the law.  “a reuters investigation released in december cast serious doubts over whether these basic requirements in federal law are being followed,” wrote kline, a republican who chairs the house education and the workforce committee. the letter was co signed by todd rokita, an indiana republican, who chairs a subcommittee on early childhood education. “the reuters investigation reveals the shocking and deadly consequences when these vital federal and state child welfare policies are not properly implemented and enforced,” the lawmakers wrote. “even more troubling, according to the reuters report, there are some states that have failed to put these policies in place altogether, yet not a single state is being denied … funds.” kline and rokita asked health and human services officials to explain the review process for determining whether each state has created a safe care plan for babies born drug dependent, and to make clear the consequences for states that do not comply. agency officials did not immediately respond to the lawmakers’ letter.  the primary backer of a key provision in the 2003 law, former representative james greenwood, said he was “delighted” that kline and rokita took “this step to light a fire under” the department of health and human services.  “precious little lives are at stake,” greenwood said. last month, top u.s. senators also called for action. sen. charles schumer, a democrat from new york, asked for an “emergency surge” of funds to help protect the newborns, and sen. robert casey, a democrat from pennsylvania, sought oversight hearings. the senior republican in the senate, majority leader mitch mcconnell, said the series “brings to the forefront a problem” that he has urged the obama administration to address faster. the reuters investigation, “helpless & hooked,” can be found here.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson will press this week for nato allies to demonstrate a “clear path” to increase defense spending, a state department official said on tuesday. tillerson will hold his first meeting with nato foreign ministers in brussels on march 31. he will push allies on how they plan to meet a defense spending goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product, and press nato to increase its role in the fight against terrorism, the official said. “it is no longer sustainable for the united states to maintain a disproportionate share of nato’s deterrence and defense spending,” the official said in a briefing with reporters, on condition of anonymity. president donald trump has unsettled european allies with demands they increase defense spending and talk of establishing an alliance with russia to counter islamic state militants. tillerson’s initial decision to skip his first meeting with nato foreign ministers to attend expected talks in the united states with chinese president xi jinping also reopened questions about the trump administration’s commitment to the alliance. the state department later said the meeting in brussels had been rescheduled and tillerson would attend. five nato members   britain, estonia, greece, poland and the united states   currently meet the 2 percent spending threshold, according to 2016 nato figures. members of the alliance have until 2024 to meet the targets. the estonian, latvian, and lithuanian foreign ministers met with tillerson at the state department on tuesday. the baltic states have felt especially vulnerable since russia annexed ukraine’s crimea region in 2014. asked if they were confident in u.s. support for nato, lithuanian foreign minister linas linkevicius responded “no doubts about that” and latvian foreign minister edgars rinkevics and estonian foreign minister sven mikser nodded in agreement. the senior state department official said trump administration officials are “pushing allies to do more, faster, absolutely no apology for that.” the united states also wants allies to give a “clear path” on how they would meet the threshold, such as timelines and budgetary commitments, he said. but the official declined to state any specifics on what the united states would do if allies did not meet the targets. “our joint security requires it, that’s the main leverage that we have,” the official said. defense secretary jim mattis said last month the united states might “moderate” its support for the alliance but gave no details.

" u.s. president elect donald trump has left the agriculture secretary as the last department head to be named to his cabinet, while a meeting with the chief executives of two agribusiness giants gave a hint at a roster of farm issues the incoming president will face.     trump met on wednesday with the leaders of monsanto co (mon.n) and bayer ag (baygn.de), who pitched the benefits of their proposed $66 billion merger. while critical of other large tie ups, trump has not publicly taken a stance on the bayer monsanto deal. the secretary of the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) will not approve or reject the merger but will face the issue of industry consolidation. dow chemical co dow.n has proposed to merge with dupont dd.n, and china national chemical corp (chemchina) [cnncc.ul] is seeking to acquire syngenta ag synn.s.      trade, environmental regulation and the 2018 federal farm bill are also expected to be at the top of the farm agenda once trump takes office jan. 20, according members of an agricultural advisory committee he formed during the campaign.     how trump responds on those issues   and who he picks to lead the usda   could determine whether he is able to maintain the strong rural support he demonstrated in the nov. 8 election. some committee members told reuters they have had meetings with trump and his advisers, and have suggested possible nominees to help define the type of person who should lead the department. former georgia governor sonny perdue is trump’s leading candidate to run the department, a senior trump transition team official said last week. trump has also met with elsa murano, undersecretary of agriculture for food safety under president george w. bush, and chuck conner, head of the national council of farmer cooperatives. he has also talked with abel maldonado, former lieutenant governor of california and co owner of runway vineyards; tim huelskamp, former republican u.s. representative from kansas; and sid miller, texas agriculture commissioner. trump’s committee wants someone who is familiar with day to day farm life, can open up new markets for trade and will pressure federal regulators to ease environmental restrictions, according to a dozen committee members interviewed by reuters. “the sooner we have someone in place (as agriculture secretary), the better,” said mike strain, louisiana’s commissioner of agriculture and forestry, and part of trump’s agricultural advisory committee. a.g. kawamura, a former california agriculture secretary who is on the committee, said discussions within trump’s transition team were “free and flowing” about who should head the agency.  the usda is made up of 29 agencies and offices that perform jobs ranging from agricultural research to working with foreign governments to facilitate trade. “generally, the country knows who the proposed cabinet is going to be before inauguration day. but if i’ve learned anything this past year, it’s that you can’t make assumptions about what will happen,” he said.     john block, an illinois corn, soybean and hog producer who served as usda secretary under president ronald reagan, is certain trump will make the right choice. “we like to think we’ll see a conclusion soon, so we can look to the future,” he said. “but we have plenty of confidence in trump, and we’re hanging in there.” one key trait some are looking for: someone to stand up for farmers amid a flurry of merger deals, such as the bayer monsanto tie up. but even members of trump’s own agricultural advisory committee disagree about the deal’s merits. bayer ceo werner baumann and monsanto ceo hugh grant had a “productive meeting with president elect trump and his team to share their views on the future of the agriculture industry and its need for innovation,” according to a statement issued by both companies.  bill northey, iowa’s agriculture secretary and a member of trump’s agricultural advisory team, said he believed the president elect was paying attention to the monsanto bayer merger because rural voters supported him in the election. he said it was possible that parts of the deal might be “beneficial and pieces of it would be detrimental.” ",0
" illinois’ governor on wednesday proposed boosting the shrinking ranks of the illinois state police in an effort to quell a steady increase in gun violence spilling over from chicago’s neighborhoods onto the city’s expressways.  bruce rauner’s proposed budget would add a projected 170 troopers through two cadet classes, one this year and another during the 2019 fiscal year. seventy of these troopers would be sent to the chicago area.      “those officers will allow us to send more patrols to the chicago area, to the expressways to counter the violence that has spilled over onto the highways there,” the republican governor told lawmakers in his springfield budget address.  the number of illinois state police troopers has declined significantly since 2008 when there were 2,105 sworn officers, according to state police data. that number dropped by more than 400 troopers to 1,671 as of last year. rauner took office in 2015.  feuding between rauner and democrats who control the legislature has kept illinois without a full operating budget since july 2015, which has meant no cadet hires for the state police in 2015 and 2016. a six month fiscal 2017 budget expired on dec. 31. at the same time, the number of shootings on chicago area expressways has consistently increased, with law enforcement placing the blame on increased gang activity.  there were just nine chicago area expressway shootings in 2011 and 2012. shooting incidents jumped to 19 in 2014 from 16 in 2013. the number nearly doubled to 37 in 2015 and rose again to 47 in 2016.  three of last year’s shootings were fatal.   there have been two confirmed shootings on the expressways so far this year and six others that are unconfirmed, illinois state police spokesman jason bradley said by email.  the violence in 2016 came as part of a broader surge in violence across chicago, the nation’s third most populous city.   with the additions to police numbers, there will be an increase in overall state police headcount of about 140 to an estimated 2,651 for the 2018 fiscal year from an estimated 2,511 for fiscal 2017.  the cost of the two classes for the 2018 fiscal year will be $10.5 million, the proposed budget said. the annualized cost of the new officers, including salaries and benefits, will be $20 million.

" illinois governor bruce rauner said on monday the state has the power to block any debt offerings by financially distressed school districts, including the cash strapped chicago public schools (cps), which has been dependent on borrowing to fund operations.  the republican governor last week launched a financial probe of the nation’s third largest public school system through the illinois state board of education. rauner, who has called for a state takeover of the school district, said the board has the legal authority to block borrowings by districts found to be in financial duress.   “the state board has never chosen to do that for the city of chicago. i hope that never becomes necessary. but we’ve got to be ready to take action,” rauner told reporters. rauner’s office pointed to a provision of the school code that it says applies to cps. the provision prohibits the sale of bonds, notes or other debt by a district certified to be in financial difficulty until a financial plan is approved by the state board of education. cps chief executive forrest claypool contended that the authority rauner seeks to exercise does not apply to cps, according to a school district spokeswoman. cps is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit, caused largely by escalating annual pension payments that will reach $676 million this fiscal year. the district’s efforts to gain an additional $480 million in state dollars to pay its pension bill have become entangled in an ongoing impasse between rauner and democrats who control the legislature. to keep operating in anticipation of $1 billion in property tax revenue next month, cps turned to short term borrowing and a $725 million bond sale earlier this month for cash flow. the district said it plans to seek additional short term borrowing authority from its governing board in the future. rauner said accusations by chicago officials that he attempted to derail the feb. 3 bond sale by pushing for a state takeover or possible bankruptcy for cps were “completely false.” skittish investors demanded hefty yields for the “junk” rated bonds, which will cost the district nearly $1.9 billion to pay off by 2044.

" the trump administration will make cost sharing payments to insurance companies under obamacare for august, a white house spokesman said on wednesday, but the announcement did little to quell long term concerns about the insurance market. president donald trump, a republican, has repeatedly threatened to stop the payments, which are made directly to insurance companies to help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income americans enrolled in individual healthcare plans under the affordable care act (aca). the payments are estimated to amount to $7 billion in 2017.  the centers for medicare and medicaid services also said on wednesday that two counties were projected to have no insurer in 2018 selling plans on the individual market created under former democratic president barack obama’s healthcare policy, down from 40 earlier this year.  both announcements could bring some short term stability to insurance markets, but the long term outlook is uncertain, said cynthia cox, policy researcher and associate director at the nonprofit kaiser family foundation. over the past several months, trump and republicans lawmakers who control both chambers of congress, regularly pointed to the number of expected so called bare counties in 2018 to argue for a bill repealing and replacing obamacare. insurers are still unsure whether republicans will again try to repeal or replace the law when they return in september from a recess and whether the trump administration will permanently make the insurer payments. they also do not know whether the administration will enforce a requirement of the aca that all americans buy health insurance or else pay a fine. it is unclear whether the federal government played a role in providing incentives to insurers to offer plans in bare counties, many of which were at risk because anthem inc, one of the largest remaining obamacare insurers, pared back its offerings in several states, said cox. state officials and insurance commissioners have worked to provide incentives and centene corp has filled in many of the gaps. “health plans have been working hard with insurance commissioners and state leaders to ensure that americans who buy their own coverage have options that are as affordable as possible,” said kristine grow, spokeswoman for insurer lobbying group, america’s health insurance plans. “this is a demonstration of that commitment.” the nonpartisan congressional budget office on tuesday estimated that health insurance premiums for many customers on the obamacare individual insurance markets would be 20 percent higher in 2018 if trump stopped the insurer payments.

" american spy chiefs have told congressmen that a plan to allow the national security agency (nsa) to share more raw eavesdropping reports with other agencies will not be unlawful and will protect the privacy rights of u.s. citizens. in a letter sent on monday to two members of congress and reviewed by reuters, director of national intelligence james clapper said the nsa’s proposal to give other spy agencies access to “unevaluated signals intelligence” will ensure data is used only for intelligence activities directed at foreigners. last week, u.s. representatives ted lieu and blake farenthold of the house oversight committee asked the nsa to halt the sharing plan, suggesting it would be “unconstitutional and dangerous.” the specifics of the proposal are still secret. lieu, a democrat from california and farenthold, a republican from texas, wrote in a march 21 letter to nsa director michael rogers that the proposal would violate fourth amendment privacy protections because the collected data would not require a warrant before being searched for domestic law enforcement purposes. monday’s reply from the intelligence chief’s office said the plan would not allow the use of communications data for domestic law enforcement. instead, the proposed rules would limit access to raw nsa data to spy agencies, “and only for authorized foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes,” said the letter. it said it would also not authorize any new collection of private communications. civil liberties advocates have interpreted the proposed change as potentially allowing nsa foreign intelligence data, which sometimes can include collection of communications to, from or about americans, to be used for domestic policing purposes. under current procedures, nsa analysts are supposed to scrub or black out certain personal information, particularly related to american citizens or residents, before handing any communications data over to other agencies. congress last year passed a law curtailing certain aspects of the nsa’s spying authority, most notably ending its bulk collection of domestic phone records exposed by former nsa contractor edward snowden in 2013. nsa began that program after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the united states by islamist militants. the nsa has presented the plan to a government advisory committee, the privacy and civil liberties oversight board, for review.

" a summit between u.s. president donald trump and his mexican counterpart enrique pena nieto next week is still on “for now”, mexico’s foreign minister said on wednesday, despite pressure at home to scrap it over objections to a border wall. earlier in the day trump signed new executive orders, including one authorizing a wall on the u.s. southern border, just as a mexican delegation led by foreign minister luis videgaray arrived at the white house for talks.  the timing caused outrage in mexico, with prominent politicians and many on social media seeing at as a deliberate snub to the government’s efforts to engage with trump, who has for months used mexico as a political punching bag. “the meeting between the two presidents in washington next tuesday is still confirmed,” videgaray said. “the meeting, for now, is going forward,” he said.  president enrique pena nieto said in a recorded message that he “disapproves” of trump’s order on the border wall and in response ordered mexico’s fifty u.s. consuls to extend legal help to citizens living in the united states. “wherever there is a mexican migrant who needs our help, we should be there,” he said. one source with knowledge of the government’s thinking said the measure was intended to clog u.s. immigration courts with legal objections to deportations. the courts already face a backlog of half a million cases. videgaray said some “positive elements” resulted from the talks, including a blunt acknowledgment by trump of the u.s. role in supplying illegal arms to mexico. he also referred to trump’s public comments that he wanted to see a strong mexican economy. videgaray said it had been “a day of contrasts,” adding that his delegation’s talks with senior white house aides lasted eight hours. speaking as trump gave orders to start work on the wall along the 2,000 mile (3,200 km) border with mexico, two time presidential runner up and leftist opposition leader andres manuel lopez obrador said the announcement was an insult to his country and called for international legal action. “i respectfully suggest that the government of mexico presents a lawsuit at the united nations against the u.s. government for violation of human rights and racial discrimination,” lopez obrador told a crowd of supporters north of mexico city. a former mayor of the capital, lopez obrador has led several early opinion polls ahead of the july 2018 election, and last week he announced plans for a tour of major u.s. cities in february to drum up support among mexican americans. trump’s broadsides against mexico have put pena nieto under rising domestic pressure. his approval ratings are at the lowest level of any mexican president in years. the american’s threats to tear up a joint trade deal and impose hefty border taxes on mexican goods have also battered the peso. but his comments on wednesday that he wanted to see a strong mexican economy lifted the currency to a three week high.

" princes william and harry paid a quiet tribute to their mother princess diana on wednesday, a day before the 20th anniversary of her death that has reignited interest in one of the world s most famous women. diana s two sons met representatives of the charities she supported in a public garden at kensington palace, their home and where their mother lived until she was killed in a car crash in paris on aug. 31, 1997.  outside the palace gates supporters of the royal family gathered in the rain to mark the occasion, with many praising diana s sons for keeping her in the public memory.  everyone remembers where they were the day she died, and when they heard about it,  said 74 year old nancy purinton, on holiday with her husband from the united states.  it was pretty dramatic.  sheltering under umbrellas, william, harry and kate took a tour of the renamed white garden, which has been transformed temporarily with white english roses and forget me nots planted earlier this year.  the palace s head gardener and a gardener who knew diana from her frequent visits to the spot, usually known as the sunken garden, explained the design and pointed out some of the princess s favorite plants.   the gathering follows weeks of renewed interest in diana, the first wife of heir to the throne prince charles. she has once again become front page news with new revelations about her life and a raft of tv documentaries to mark the anniversary. previous anniversaries of her death have passed with little fuss, suggesting that the  people s princess , as she was dubbed by then british prime minister tony blair, had perhaps lost some of her allure and relevance. but with the popular william and harry coming to the fore, the 20th anniversary has sparked a re examination of the role diana played in britain and the royal family, from her lavish wedding in 1981 to her bitter divorce.  the princes have also been increasingly willing to speak about the trauma of her death and its lasting impact.  i m glad that they ve finally loosened up a little bit to talk about her and how really hard it was for them,  purinton said of the princes.  i think they were  stiff upper lip  for so long and now they re able to talk about it, which i think helps other people if they re grieving.   diana s death in a paris underpass sparked an outpouring of grief that stunned many britons, with thousands of mourners descending on the palace to leave flowers and letters to pay tribute to a woman who had become a global fashion icon and charity campaigner.   i was here the first time around,  alexia mcdonald, 54 and a full time carer, told reuters.  we were similar age ... (i remember) seeing the fairytale wedding. she was my generation and i just felt a connection.   i felt i needed to pay my respects to diana.  outside the palace on wednesday, britons again left flowers, photographs and messages attached to the front gates, although in far fewer numbers than immediately after her death.      after touring the garden, the princes met representatives from causes diana had supported, including great ormond street hospital, the national aids trust and the leprosy mission.  on thursday, they will reflect on their mother s life in private.

" six current and former michigan and flint officials were criminally charged on wednesday for their roles in the city’s water crisis that was linked to an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease that caused at least 12 deaths, the state’s attorney general said. five of the officials, including michigan health and human services director nick lyon, were charged with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis, michigan attorney general bill schuette said in a statement.   involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. lyon, 49, was also charged with one count of misconduct in office. the felony charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. four current and former state and flint officials were also charged with involuntary manslaughter. the four had all been previously charged with lesser crimes in connection with the water crisis.  the state’s chief medical executive, eden wells, was charged wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to police. michigan governor rick snyder said in a statement that lyon and wells have his “full faith and confidence” and would remain on duty and help in flint’s recovery. an attorney for lyon could not be reached for comment. it was not immediately known if wells had an attorney. schuette said his team had not spoken with snyder as part of the investigation. “we attempted to interview the governor. we were not successful,” schuette said. he declined to elaborate. previously, schuette, when asked if snyder was a target in the investigation, said there were no targets but “nobody is off the table.” some critics have called for high ranking state officials, including snyder, to be charged. snyder previously said he believed he had not done anything criminally wrong. “the governor isn’t going to speculate on where the investigation is or is not headed, but he continues to cooperate fully,” snyder’s spokeswoman anna heaton said.  snyder’s attorney, brian lennon, said in a statement that snyder was made available to testify under oath this spring after being told a subpoena would be produced, but that never occurred. he added that snyder previously testified under oath to congress. wednesday’s charges stem from more than 80 cases of legionnaires’ disease, including the fatalities, that were believed to be linked to the water in flint after the city switched its source to the flint river from lake huron in april 2014. lyon was aware of the legionnaires’ outbreak in genesee county at least one year before he informed the public, according to court documents. his deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of genesee township resident robert skidmore, 85, from legionnaires’ in december 2015, the documents said.   wells lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. she also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said. “it’s good to see that state attorney general schuette and his team are taking this matter seriously,” flint mayor karen weaver said in a statement. “we all are waiting to see what else the investigation uncovers.” the crisis in flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. the more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. lead levels in flint’s drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials said last january. others charged with involuntary manslaughter on wednesday included former state appointed emergency manager darnell earley, former flint city employee howard croft, and former state department of environmental quality officials stephen busch and liane shekter smith.

" more than a week after the philippines declared victory over pro islamic state militants in marawi, security officials on friday expressed concern over lone wolf attacks, with australia issuing a  high threat  alert about travel to manila. skirmishes continued between soldiers and holdouts from the islamist militant group that seized a lakeside town on the southern island of mindanao. more than 1,100 people, including 165 troops, were killed in the five month conflict.  one concern after marawi is the possibility of threats from lone wolves,  defense department spokesman arsenio andolong told reporters, two days after an uzbek plowed into new york pedestrians and bikers in what u.s. officials called a terrorist act. the army remained on high alert after president rodrigo duterte said five cities in mindanao were potential targets of islamist militants after their defeat in marawi, he added. on friday, the australian embassy issued a travel advisory, warning of  a high threat of terrorist attack  in the philippines, including manila, the capital.  be alert to possible threats around locations that have a low level of protective security and places known to be possible terrorist targets,  it said. it told australians to reconsider travel plans to eastern mindanao and avoid its central and western regions. the advisory was similar to one issued early this year, said military spokesman major general restituto padilla.  it was only a reiteration, there is no credible threat,  he added. two days ago, army soldiers killed the righthand man of abu sayyaf leader isnilon hapilon, the emir of pro islamic state militants in southeast asia, who was gunned down last month. his death hastened the collapse of the marawi based militant group, leading to its defeat.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday detailed $5.6 million in contributions he raised for military veterans, and staged a fiery news conference where he attacked reporters for questioning him for months about the money.                  appearing at trump tower in manhattan, the billionaire accused the media of failing to give him credit for raising the funds at an event in january in iowa. his tirade, in which he called one reporter “a sleaze” and sarcastically described another as a “real beauty,” overshadowed what otherwise should have been an upbeat event for the presumptive republican nominee. “the press should be ashamed of themselves,” he told reporters gathered before him. “you make me look very bad. i’ve never received such bad publicity for doing a good job.” while trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media, questions about the donations to veterans touched a raw nerve with him as he tries to build a conservative base ahead of the nov. 8 general election.     reporters have been persistently asking whether trump in fact raised all the money he said he had in january and why it took so long to hand donations over to veterans groups. a number of veterans groups listed by trump on tuesday as recipients confirmed they had received the donation as listed, ranging from $25,000 to, in one case, $1.1 million, which went to the marine corps law enforcement foundation. some of the donations arrived in february or march, some as recently as last week around the time a critical article appeared in the washington post. the money arrived in the form of a check from the donald j. trump foundation. “we received a $75,000 gift early last week from the trump foundation, it was not restricted or earmarked in any way,” said katherine fritz, director of development at america’s vetdogs. trump’s criticism of the media dashed the hopes of some republican leaders who want him to tone down his rhetoric and become more magnanimous now that he has sealed the republican presidential nomination. the washington post said trump only handed over a personal donation of $1 million last week   four months after announcing it   once the newspaper started asking about the money. trump said the news coverage of his veterans group donations had been close to libelous. asked whether he would maintain an adversarial stance with reporters if elected president, trump said: “yeah, it’s going to be like this.” a reporter told trump he seemed resistant to the kind of scrutiny that comes with the office of u.s. president. but ari fleischer, a former white house press secretary for president george w. bush, said the news media should stop fretting about how trump treats them. “my advice to the press: stop interviewing yourselves about trump’s attack on the press. don’t worry about it. just do your jobs and be fair,” he said. the contretemps took place on the same day documents were disclosed from a lawsuit involving trump university, a now defunct education program that ran a real estate training program. trump has attacked the presiding judge as hostile to him.  the university documents showed trump university created a special class to teach students how to cash in on u.s. mortgage foreclosures when the united states was struggling with an entrenched housing crisis in 2009. democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton sought to take advantage of trump’s discomfort over the media scrutiny he has faced. she told cnn that trump’s tendency to attack his critics “is a recipe for gridlock in washington.” clinton defended her own policy toward dealing with the news media, saying she has conducted 300 interviews this year alone. unlike trump, she rarely holds news conferences. her last one was last december. clinton leads trump by 11 percentage points in the latest reuters/ipsos opinion poll. according to the may 27 31 survey of likely voters, 46 percent support the former u.s. secretary of state while 35 percent back trump.   california governor jerry brown on tuesday endorsed clinton for the democratic nomination, saying it was the only way to “stop the dangerous candidacy of donald trump.”            at his news conference, trump also bristled at the possibility that republicans opposed to him might run a third party candidate as an alternative to trump or the expected democratic nominee clinton. he said a leader of that effort, bill kristol, editor of the weekly standard magazine, “looks like such a fool.” “let me tell you these people are losers,” said trump, adding that a third party candidacy would guarantee clinton wins the white house and deny republicans the chance to put conservatives on the supreme court. “what you’re going to do is lose the election for the republicans and therefore you lose the supreme court,” he said. trump read out a list of veterans’ organizations that had received money from the january event, which he attended instead of participating in a fox news sponsored candidates’ debate. he said the money was benefiting 41 groups and that the total cash raised could climb as more comes in.  he turned the microphone over briefly to al baldasaro, a trump supporter and a veteran from new hampshire who also skewered the news media, saying reporters should “get your head out of your butt, focus on the real issues.”

" europe must be prepared to respond in kind if the united states’ proposed new sanctions against russia end up hurting its companies, an influential german industry association said on thursday. u.s. lawmakers reached an agreement on wednesday paving the way for the u.s. senate to pass a bill as early as this week to impose the new sanctions on russia and bar president donald trump from easing them without congress’ approval. the european union fears the new u.s. restrictions could be an obstacle to its companies doing business with russia and threaten the bloc’s energy supply lines, but the 28 country bloc is divided over how to respond. the head of the german committee on east european economic relations said potential damage to european energy sector companies with business interests in russia could justify counter sanctions. “it’s the last thing we want, but we must keep the option open,” michael harms told a news conference in berlin. “the sanctions they want against pipeline projects seem designed to boost u.s. energy exports to europe, create u.s. jobs and strengthen u.s. foreign policy.” unlike the united states, whose growing production of shale gas has slashed its reliance on energy imports, much of central europe depends on imports of russian gas through a vast latticework of pipelines. “imposing sanctions that hit a third party, namely europe, and at the same time promoting the american economy with the slogan ‘buy american gas’   that’s pretty striking,” said kurt bock, chief executive of germans chemicals giant basf , which drills for gas in russia. the eu has imposed its own sanctions against russia over its role in the ukraine crisis, and germany has taken a particularly tough stance towards moscow. last week reuters reported that germany was urging brussels to add four more russian nationals and companies to its blacklist over siemens gas turbines delivered to ukraine’s crimea region, annexed by moscow in 2014. german economy minister brigitte zyries complained on thursday that washington had abandoned the “common line” it has maintained with europe over russia. but despite the eu sanctions and europe’s criticism of moscow on other fronts as well as ukraine   including allegations that russian spies are meddling in western elections    russia remains a crucial business partner for germany. on thursday, the committee raised to 20 percent its forecast for growth in german exports to russia in 2017, compared to 10 percent in its previous forecast.

" contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the central intelligence agency’s use of hacking tools to anti secrecy group wikileaks, u.s. intelligence and law enforcement officials told reuters on wednesday. two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to wikileaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on tuesday. according to the documents, cia hackers could get into apple inc (aapl.o) iphones, devices running google’s android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. the white house said on wednesday that president donald trump was “extremely concerned” about the cia security breach that led to the wikileaks release. “anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law,” spokesman sean spicer said. the two officials told reuters they believed the published documents about cia hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. one of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the cia have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that wikileaks published, and then going over their computer logs, emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. on tuesday in a press release, wikileaks itself said the cia had “lost control” of an archive of hacking methods and it  appeared to have been circulated “among former u.s. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided wikileaks with portions of the archive.” the cia, which is the united states’ civilian foreign intelligence service, declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents.  the agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad “to protect america from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries” and to be “innovative, cutting edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad.” the cia is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the united states and “does not do so”, the statement added. a u.s. government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the federal bureau of investigation and the cia both to open investigations into such leaks. u.s. officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in alexandria, virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of wikileaks and its personnel.  a spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded. it is not clear if the investigation of the latest cia leaks is part of the probe. contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably edward snowden and harold thomas martin, both employed by consulting firm booz allen hamilton (bah.n) while working for the national security agency.  u.s. senator dianne feinstein of california and a democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches.   “i think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to america to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don’t do it,” feinstein said. both u.s. senate and u.s. house of representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the cia breach, congressional officials said. some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former president barack obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure. those concerns would grow if u.s. authorities did not notify companies that cia documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised. apple, alphabet inc’s (googl.o) google, cisco systems inc (csco.o) and oracle corp (orcl.n) did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a cia breach before wikileaks made its files public. at apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there. google’s director of information security and privacy,  heather adkins, said in a statement: “as we’ve reviewed the documents, we’re confident that security updates and protections in both chrome and android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections.” one reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published. one european official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the wikileaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between european intelligence agencies and u.s. counterparts, which share concerns about russian intelligence operations. u.s. intelligence agencies have accused russia of seeking to tilt last year’s u.s. presidential election in trump’s favor,  including by hacking into democratic party emails. moscow has denied the allegation. one major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has “exploded” because of federal budget constraints, the first u.s. official said. u.s. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the “internet of things” that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said. reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents.  a person familiar with wikileaks’ activities said the group has had the cia hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works “for a long time.” in germany on wednesday, the chief federal prosecutor’s office said that it would review the wikileaks documents because some suggested that the cia ran a hacking hub from the u.s. consulate in frankfurt. “we will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators,” a spokesman for the federal prosecutor’s office told reuters. chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to visit washington on march 14 for her first meeting with trump, who has sharply criticized berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.

" a u.s. judge on friday dealt a major financial blow to illinois by ordering the cash strapped state to pay $586 million a month to medicaid providers to ensure continued medical care for poor and disabled residents. the order by judge joan lefkow also stipulated that illinois send $2 billion to medicaid providers during the fiscal year that starts on saturday to pay down the existing $3.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. illinois comptroller susana mendoza, whose office pays the state’s bills, said the ruling “takes the state’s finances from horrific to catastrophic” and called on state lawmakers to immediately pass a budget. “payments to the state’s pension funds; state payroll including legislator pay; general state aid to schools and payments to local governments – in some combination – will likely have to be cut,” she said in a statement. “payments to the state’s bond holders will continue uninterrupted.” the decision came as illinois lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a budget on friday, leaving a state with the worst credit rating in the nation poised to enter a third straight fiscal year without a full operating budget. governor bruce rauner’s office had no comment on the ruling. lefkow had issued an order on june 7 that concluded illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding medicaid. that order allowed attorneys representing illinois’ 3 million medicaid recipients to seek a subsequent order forcing the state to increase payments to managed care organizations, which in turn pay doctors, hospitals and others. in her latest order, the judge said the state failed to offer a payment plan that would result in substantial compliance with the consent decrees that stemmed from lawsuits filed against illinois in 1992. attorneys representing medicaid recipients said illinois, which has been allocating only $160 million a month to the healthcare program, will be able to subsequently seek reimbursement for about half of the higher payment from the federal government.  “without these payments, doctors, hospitals, clinics and other key healthcare providers would stop seeing medicaid patients, or else simply go out of business altogether,” tom yates of the legal council for health justice said in a statement. illinois’ unprecedented budget impasse between its republican governor and democrats who control the legislature has ballooned the state’s unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion.

" coal mining executive robert murray, one of donald trump’s biggest campaign backers, said on friday he wants the president elect to support a bill that would protect the health and pension benefits of thousands of coal miners retired from companies that have gone bust. the outspoken founder of ohio based murray energy corp said he has asked trump, who campaigned on a promise to help the coal industry, to speak out on behalf of the spending bill provision currently tied up in congress. “i asked him and vice president elect mike pence to be involved verbally and in writing,” murray told reuters in an interview. murray said he has not yet heard back. a trump transition official did not respond to a request for comment. murray energy was among the biggest contributors to trump’s bid for the presidency. its $100,000 donation to the trump victory pac was the pac’s largest from a company, according to trump’s fundraising committee’s latest filing. murray also hosted fundraisers for the republican candidate. on the campaign trail, trump won over coal producing states by promising to revive the sector, put laid off miners back to work, and scrap regulations that he said are hobbling the industry.  coal prices have sunk in recent years due to competition from cheap natural gas and rules to combat climate change ushered in by president barack obama. the senate is now contemplating a spending bill that contains a provision to extend the benefits of retired coal miners whose companies have gone bankrupt until next april, but some coal state democratic senators are agitating for a longer term solution and threatening a government shutdown. a group of republicans, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky, are resisting, and the bill is in limbo.  white house spokesman josh earnest said thursday that the obama administration hopes “there should be bipartisan common ground to address the needs of these 20,000 coal miners who are slated to lose their health insurance at the end of the month.”  dozens of united mine worker retired miners have been on capitol hill this week holding rallies and visiting lawmakers to urge them to pass a longer term solution. umwa spokesman phil smith said the trump transition team is aware of the issue but has not said anything publicly. as one of just a handful of u.s. coal companies that has not declared bankruptcy, murray said his company is struggling to pay into its health and pension funds and “can’t compete with those companies that didn’t go through bankruptcy proceedings.” ",0
" the next round of aid to help rebuild puerto rico and u.s. states after destructive hurricanes and wildfires is unlikely to be considered by congress until it takes up a catch all spending bill that faces a dec. 8 deadline for passage, the no. 2 senate republican said on wednesday. john cornyn said a crush of other matters would take up time, so “we probably won’t get to that” (disaster aid) until consideration of a massive bill to fund federal agencies through next sept. 30. the trump administration has said it will submit to congress a third round of disaster aid in mid november that could total tens of billions of dollars. congress already has provided over $51 billion currently, the republican controlled congress is mainly focused on passing a major tax reform bill by year’s end. the disaster aid would help recovery efforts in texas, florida, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands following hurricanes harvey, irma and maria in august and september. six weeks after maria tore through puerto rico, the island is struggling to pick up the pieces, and about two thirds of its residents remain without power. the u.s. territory declared bankruptcy earlier this year and the storm has plunged its economy into deeper uncertainty. the government wide spending bill could also become a magnet for measures that democrats, who are in the minority in congress, want to attach. those could include a bipartisan plan to temporarily bolster the affordable care act, commonly known as “obamacare.” democrats also are hinting that the end of year measure could be an opportunity to force passage of legislation protecting from deportation young “dreamers,” people brought illegally to the united states as children.

" the u.n. peacekeeping mission in congo on monday condemned the arrest of about 30 opposition members amid a crackdown on dissent by president joseph kabila s government.  the arrests occurred in the southeastern city of lubumbashi on sunday when police broke up a meeting by the union for democracy and social progress (udps) party on the eve of a return to the city of opposition leader felix tshisekedi, party members told reuters.     such security incidents are threatening to spiral out of control in africa s largest copper producer because of kabila s refusal to hold elections when his presidential mandate expired nearly a year ago.  from now, we no longer consider joseph kabila as president,  tshisekedi told journalists on monday in lubumbashi, where a planned rally was banned by the government. he is usually in the capital, or in europe.  congo s government has banned opposition demonstrations since last year, when security forces killed dozens of protesters demanding kabila s departure.    the election commission said this month that an election to replace kabila, who came to power after his father s assassination in 2001, would not be possible before april 2019 at the earliest   raising the prospect of long term unrest.  i urge the congolese authorities to release immediately and unconditionally those arbitrarily arrested yesterday in lubumbashi,  said maman sidikou, head of the u.n. monusco peacekeeping mission. monusco also demanded an end to restrictions imposed on kyungu wa kumwanza, president of the national union of federalists of the congo (unafec) party, who has been under de facto house arrest for several months without being charged with a crime. in another sign of discontent with election delays, the union for the congolese nation(unc)opposition party said in a statement on monday it was withdrawing its representative in a power sharing government, budget minister pierre kangudia. the latter could not immediately be reached for comment. kabila s political opponents are weak and divided. many joined a power sharing government earlier this year following the death of opposition figure, etienne tshisekedi, felix s father, and they enjoy limited credibility with the population.  however, an economic crisis that has seen inflation spike to over 50 percent, increased militia activity, and a series of prison breaks have highlighted kabila s tenuous hold on power.

" one of the most powerful democrats in the u.s. congress on tuesday pressed president elect donald trump to keep the consumer financial watchdog agency’s current director, as rumors about a possible termination and replacement swirled.  senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters that trump will break his campaign promise of “standing up for workers and consumers against the rigged system” if he fires the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau’s (cfpb) director, richard cordray, after taking office on friday. “if trump intends to keep any of his promises and un rig the system, he would keep rich cordray,” the senator from new york said in a phone call with reporters. created in the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law, the cfpb has battled all sorts of lenders through regulation and litigation. it most recently participated in a settlement with wells fargo for $190 million for allegedly creating ghost accounts.      by law, the president can only fire the agency’s director for cause, but a recent federal court decision says the u.s. chief executive should be able to dismiss the director at will. that decision has been stayed pending appeal. some want trump to not wait for the appeals court and fire cordray for cause as soon as he becomes president. at the earliest, the full u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit is expected to announce in february whether it will review the case. last week, trump met with one of the agency’s biggest critics, former republican representative randy neugebauer of texas, who is frequently mentioned as a top choice for to replace cordray. conservatives say neugebauer would limit the reach of the cfpb, which they say has gone too far and does not have enough accountability. congress is controlled by the republican party, and most republicans would prefer having a commission in charge of the agency, instead of a director who both creates and enforces rules. during the call with reporters, schumer characterized the possibility of making neugebauer director as an attempt to dismantle the cfpb from the inside. also on the call, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts said removing cordray would allow trump to block the cfpb’s current work on rules on mandatory arbitration, payday lending and debt collection. democrats like warren, who came up with the idea of an agency to protect individuals’ finances after the 2007 09 crisis, say the cfpb is an important guard against fraud in mortgages, student loans and other consumer products.

" a u.s. navy said it has called off a search for three sailors missing since a transport plane crashed in the philippines sea south of japan on wednesday enroute to the uss ronald reagan aircraft carrier.  during the course of two days, eight u.s. navy and japan maritime defence force ships, three helicopter squadrons and maritime patrol aircraft covered nearly 1,000 square nautical miles,  the u.s. seventh fleet said in a press release.  eight other people on a c 2 greyhound were rescued shortly after the aircraft crashed and transferred to the reagan.  the latest navy accident in the asia pacific comes after two deadly incidents in the region involving u.s. warships that have raised questions about training and the pace of navy operations in the region, prompting a congressional hearing and the removal of a number of some senior officers. the propeller powered c 2 on wednesday was conducting a routine flight carrying passengers and cargo from marine corps air station iwakuni in japan to the carrier.  the mainstay transport aircraft for the u.s. carrier fleet has been in operation for more than five decades and is due to be replaced by a long range version of the tilt rotor osprey aircraft. the u.s. navy said it is investigating the cause of the crash. japanese minister of defence itsunori onodera told reporters on wednesday that the u.s. navy informed him that the crash may have been a result of engine trouble.

" theresa may looked  despondent , with deep rings under her eyes, eu chief executive jean claude juncker told aides after dining with the british prime minister last week, a german newspaper said on sunday. the report by a frankfurter allgemeine zeitung correspondent whose leaked account of a juncker may dinner in april caused upset in london, said juncker thought her  marked  by battles over brexit with her own conservative ministers as she asked for eu help to create more room for maneuver at home. no immediate comment was available from juncker s office, which has a policy of not commenting on reports of meetings. the faz said may, who flew in for a hastily announced dinner in brussels with the european commission president last monday ahead of an eu summit, seemed to juncker  anxious, despondent and disheartened ,  a woman who trusts hardly anyone but is also not ready for a clear out to free herself . as she later did over dinner on thursday with fellow eu leaders, may asked for help to overcome british divisions.  she indicated that back home friend and foe are at her back plotting to bring her down,  the paper said.  may said she had no room left to maneuver. the europeans have to create it for her.   may s face and appearance spoke volumes, juncker later told his colleagues,  the faz added.  she has deep rings under her eyes. she looks like someone who can t sleep a wink.  she smiles for the cameras, it went on,  but it looks forced , unlike in the past, when she could shake with laughter.  now she needs all her strength not to lose her poise.  as with the april dinner at 10 downing street, when the faz reported that juncker thought may  in another galaxy  in terms of brexit expectations, both sides issued statements after last week s meeting saying talks were  constructive and friendly . they said they agreed negotiations should be  accelerated . may dismissed the dinner leak six months ago as  brussels gossip , though officials on both sides said the report in the faz did little to foster an atmosphere of trust which they agree will be important to reach a deal. german chancellor angela merkel was also reported to have been irritated by that leak. although the summit on thursday and friday rejected may s call for an immediate start to talks on the future relationship, leaders made a gesture to speed up the process and voiced hopes of opening a new phase in december. some said they understood may s difficulties in forging consensus in london.

" a blaze in a building under construction in a suburb of the indian city of mumbai killed at least six people, most of them laborers, and injured nearly a dozen, fire and police officials said on thursday. the cause of the fire, which broke out late on wednesday, was being investigated, a fire service officer said. it is likely to compound concern about safety in the financial hub after an old building collapsed last week killing 34 people. laborers working on the building were living on the ground floor, some with families, and cooking gas canisters were believed to have exploded in the fire, fuelling its spread.  though the fire was brought under control immediately, all injuries and deaths occurred before the arrival of the fire brigade,  said p.s. rahangdale, chief officer at the mumbai fire brigade. eleven people were injured, eight of them critically, he said. mumbai has endured torrential monsoon rain and serious flooding over recent weeks. the building collapsed last week in a congested neighborhood of the old city after two days of intense downpours.

" a defiant president donald trump has pledged to appeal to the u.s. supreme court if necessary to fight for his revised travel ban, parts of which were halted by two different federal judges in recent days.  the legal path forward will be challenging, though, as lawsuits work their way through federal courts on opposite sides of the country, in hawaii and maryland. on thursday, a federal judge in washington state said he was also weighing a temporary restraining order. the justice department’s first step would likely be filing an appeal in either or both of the cases it lost this week, an action likely to come within days. justice department spokeswoman sarah isgur flores declined to comment on the administration’s intentions. in granting a temporary restraining order against the ban challenged in a lawsuit brought by the state of hawaii, u.s. district judge derrick watson found on wednesday that “a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.” trump’s executive order would temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly muslim countries. the president has said the ban is needed for national security.  early on thursday, u.s. district judge theodore chuang issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in a case in maryland brought by refugee resettlement agencies represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center. chuang ruled that the groups were likely to succeed in showing that the travel ban portion of the executive order was intended to be a ban on muslims, and as a result, violates the u.s. constitution’s religious freedom guarantee. he did not enjoin the refugee portion of the ban.  “to avoid sowing seeds of division in our nation, upholding this fundamental constitutional principle at the core of our nation’s identity plainly serves a significant public interest,” chuang wrote in his ruling. the court orders, while victories for the plaintiffs, are only an early step in litigation and the government could ultimately win its underlying case. watson and chuang were appointed to the bench by former democratic president barack obama.  trump, speaking after the hawaii ruling at a rally in nashville on wednesday, called his revised executive order a “watered down version” of his first. the president said he would take the case “as far as it needs to go,” including to the supreme court, in order to get a ruling that the ban is legal. the trump administration won a small legal victory later on thursday. u.s. district judge james robart in seattle, who last month blocked trump’s first travel ban, ruled that the second travel ban was different enough from the first that he would not simply apply a preliminary injunction he issued against the first ban to the second one. he said he was weighing a request for a temporary restraining order on the new travel ban. the likely next stops if the administration decides to contest the two rulings that it lost this week would be the 4th and 9th u.s. circuit courts of appeal. both may be frosty venues for trump’s arguments, with majorities of the judges in each appointed by democratic presidents.  three judges on the 9th circuit upheld robart’s order last month on the first travel ban. rather than appeal further, the administration withdrew the ban, promising to retool it in ways that would address the legal issues. the supreme court is currently split between four conservative and four liberal justices, with no ninth justice since the death of antonin scalia more than a year ago. trump’s nominee to fill the vacant supreme court seat, neil gorsuch, a 49 year old conservative, is likely to be asked about the travel ban next week when he goes before the senate judiciary committee for a confirmation hearing.  republicans are hoping that the senate votes to confirm gorsuch for the court by mid april, which would likely be too late for him to weigh in on an emergency appeal about the travel ban. trump signed the new ban on march 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with his january executive order, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before robart stopped its enforcement in february. watson’s order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. he set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended.

" leaders of the congressional committee that investigates data breaches and computer hacking blasted the main u.s. banking regulator on thursday for possibly jeopardizing the work of its inspector general, an internal watchdog, and hunting out potential whistleblowers.  part of the house science committee for months has been looking into the theft of thousands of records from the federal deposit insurance corp, including two breaches in which workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agency’s employ. in a letter to fdic chairman martin gruenberg, lamar smith, the committee’s chairman, and barry loudermilk, chairman of the subcommittee on oversight, described an agency slow to cooperate with lawmakers that fails to conduct “good faith” searches for requested information. moreover, the two, both republicans, said the fdic had gathered and reviewed internal communications of its inspector general’s office while collecting documents that the committee had requested.  by law, inspectors general are independent. they function as the ethical and legal consciences of federal agencies, rooting out fraud and mismanagement, often with information provided confidentially by employees. “not only is the committee troubled that the fdic continues to withhold pertinent and responsive information to its cybersecurity posture,” it is “even more concerned by the fdic’s gathering and review” of the inspector general office’s internal communications, they wrote. that could compromise the inspector general’s “ability to conduct its work in a manner uninhibited by the very agency it was created to oversee,” they added. the fdic was not immediately available to comment. when the committee received documents from the fdic earlier this week, the lawmakers said, it noticed a “distinct watermark included on each page.”  “given the committee’s concerns about potential retaliation against whistleblowers discussed in previous letters to the fdic, the fdic’s inclusion of a novel watermark raises serious questions about whether the agency it attempting to identify the source of committee materials,” they said. they added that some of the watermarked pages covered communications between the inspector general and fdic employees, raising concerns that the agency is attempting to identify confidential informants. the committee is demanding that the fdic send it information on actions to protect whistleblowers and inspector general communications by monday, june 13.

" two gunmen fired a round of shots at the headquarters of greece s socialist pasok party in central athens on monday,  causing no injuries but slightly damaging a nearby clothing store, police said. the shots were fired about an hour before a televised debate among candidates to lead the broader socialist alliance.  there were about 30 people inside the party s headquarters when at least four shots were fired. two men were seen leaving the scene on a motorbike,  a police official said. a police officer on duty had seen an assailant pointing a gun at him but managed to take cover, the official said, suggesting the gunmen were not targeting the party but the police outside. pasok has often been the target of violent attacks in the past and its current leader fofi gennimata blamed the government for not taking action to prevent this.  we have repeatedly been the target of attacks,  gennimata told skai tv.  we have repeatedly warned the citizens protection minister in the past.  in january attackers shot at riot police guarding the pasok offices, slightly wounding one officer. the leftist led government condemned the attack.

" more than 9.2 million u.s. consumers signed up for health insurance using the healthcare.gov website during the open enrollment period between november and jan. 31, the u.s. government said on friday. enrollment was down from 9.7 million a year ago but the decline was smaller than some had predicted amid president donald trump’s push to overturn former president barack obama’s signature healthcare reform under which the plans are sold. with several insurers pulling out over rising costs, and republican congressional efforts to scuttle the affordable care act (aca), known as obamacare, the enrollment period was seen as a test of the program’s popularity. healthcare.gov sells health insurance under the aca for 39 states. the remaining states run their own exchanges. the total number of plan selections across all states for the entire open enrollment period will be released in march. average premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan rose 25 percent compared with the previous year. at the same time the number of insurance providers choosing to participate in the exchanges fell by 28 percent. of the 9.2 million, about 3 million were new consumers while 6.2 million were returning consumers. the figures include any cancellations that occurred during the period. trump’s surprise victory in early november as the enrollment period got underway created serious doubts about whether people would sign up for the insurance program. a move by the trump administration to pull television ads reminding consumers that the enrollment deadline was approaching likely contributed to the dropoff. “this may have cost about 500,000 additional enrollments,” said ron pollack, executive director of healthcare consumer advocacy group families usa, in a statement, calling the move an “attempt to sabotage enrollment.” “and despite all that, millions of consumers still got their insurance through the aca,” pollack said. meanwhile, republican efforts to repeal the healthcare law have stumbled over an inability so far to come up with a comprehensive replacement plan. republican senator lamar alexander of tennessee this week said changes to the law would be made in “chunks” and would be better labeled a “repair.” ",0

" if democratic hopeful bernie sanders has a chance of drawing african american voters away from rival hillary clinton in south carolina’s presidential nominating contest on feb. 27, his best opportunity will be among the young. african americans support former secretary of state clinton by more than a 3 to 1 margin nationwide, but among young blacks 18 to 29 years old, that margin shrinks to 46 percent for clinton versus 33 percent for sanders, according to recent reuters/ipsos polling. african americans overwhelmingly back democrats, but opinion polls in the run up to the nov. 8 presidential election show younger blacks more apt to reject an establishment candidate. they seem less inclined than their parents to reward clinton for the outreach of her husband, former president bill clinton, and more drawn to sanders’ outspoken views on reducing income inequality, cracking down on wall street, and cutting the cost of college. reuters/ipsos polling last year showed that 36 percent of blacks between 18 and 29 years old thought the country was on the “wrong track,” compared with 23 percent of blacks who were at least 60 years old. for sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, this trend could help him chip away at clinton’s firewall of minority voters in the southern states, after his strong showings against her   especially among the young   in the early democratic party contests of iowa and new hampshire, both more than 90 percent white. the voting age population in south carolina, one of the next stops on the primary trail, is about 67 percent white and 27 percent black, the u.s. census bureau says. in orangeburg, south carolina, students at the historically black schools of south carolina state university and claflin university appeared split this week over which of the two candidates to support. students praised clinton’s work on behalf of women and minorities and her years of washington experience. but many said they also were intrigued by sanders’ plans to raise taxes on wealthier people and wall street firms, provide universal healthcare and offer free public college tuition. “the history is important. but at the same time ... you still need a plan,” said travis pascoe, 25, a second year graduate student at claflin. he said sanders’ plans for reducing inequality by taxing the wealthy and expanding medicare to cover all americans should resonate with the black community. “i think that would help the black community because we’re the least privileged,” he said.  eight of 16 students interviewed were undecided voters. of the eight students whose minds were made up, four students said they planned to vote for clinton.  ethel hillman, 25, a freshman who served in the military before going to college for social work, said she and many of her fellow students were voting for clinton. she described sanders as too aloof. “he’s not socially connected, i would say, to the black community,” she said. “he cares from a distance.” south carolina state’s student center, which houses a bowling center and dining area, has quotes on walls from prominent black leaders, including president barack obama and first lady michelle obama, singer michael jackson and educator booker t. washington.  on one wall is a memorial to students killed in the 1968 “orangeburg massacre,” when protesters were shot by state highway patrol officers on campus amid tensions over racial discrimination. for sanders, minority voters have been a lingering weakness. he struggled early in his campaign to appeal to black voters. protesters from the black lives matter movement interrupted his speeches, viewing him as out of touch with black issues. to counter that perception, sanders touted his college civil rights activism, did publicity events with rapper killer mike, and on wednesday met black civil rights leader al sharpton in harlem. like clinton, sanders has sent surrogates to historically black colleges. the writer and activist cornel west spoke at south carolina state on sanders’ behalf, and actress angela bassett spoke there in support of clinton.      where sanders is fighting for inroads into the black electorate, clinton finds a comfort zone. her campaign has said it believes its road to the nomination would become smoother once it moves south, to places where she and her husband, the former president, have ties to minority leaders. clinton picked up the endorsement of the congressional black caucus political action committee on thursday. as the stakes mount in south carolina, representative jim clyburn, one of the state’s most influential democrats, said he was considering endorsing a candidate. he did not endorse in hillary clinton’s 2008 primary race against obama, and previously said he would not weigh in this year. his wavering was echoed in the views of several students on the campus of south carolina state. “i’m kind of caught between bernie sanders and hillary,” said kelsie bryant, 19, a sophomore education major at south carolina state. she said it was important to have a woman president, and she was worried sanders was too old. but she said his meeting with sharpton sent a positive signal about his outreach to blacks. cetris brooks, 21, a senior biology major at south carolina state, said that ultimately she was “a little bit more trusting” of clinton because of what the former first lady meant to her family. she said her parents had long supported clinton, and her uncle knew the former president.

" a u.s. tax overhaul proposed by republican leaders in congress would deepen divisions between big manufacturers like boeing co and the thousands of smaller companies that supply them, according to suppliers and tax and trade experts. u.s. automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals, which would tax imports at a 20 percent rate, and could split these sectors into winners and losers. the revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry, where boeing’s aggressive cost cutting driven by fierce competition with european rival airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad. aerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching boeing’s factories in washington and south carolina. u.s. based suppliers to boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. boeing, the top exporter among u.s. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free. boeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as united technologies corp, general electric co and honeywell international inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the republican tax package.  the plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which president donald trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost u.s. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible. lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff. if the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, norfil complex machining, a 40 employee company in pacific, washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from russia. the metal goes into parts norfil makes for boeing landing gear that get assembled in japan.   “a lot of russian titanium goes into planes,” said doren spinner, norfil’s ceo. his purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax “would end up affecting what the plane would cost,” he says. other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low cost locations abroad. “if the taxes are ridiculous, we’d just have to think of something creative,” said paul doran, a sales manager at mifa, a subsidiary of netherlands based aalberts industries nv that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. “i think most companies would be in the same boat.”  colin frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier carr lane manufacturing co in st. louis, missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. “we’d end up splitting up the company and i don’t think that’s necessarily good for the u.s. economy,” he said.  boeing said it was too soon to judge the plan’s effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain. “these assessments will vary by company, and it’s premature to speculate or generalize,” boeing spokeswoman kate bernard said.  boeing was among about 90 companies, including many suppliers, that signed a letter this month from the aerospace industries association urging congress to overhaul the u.s. tax system. boeing also is part of the american made coalition, an industry group that backs republican tax proposals. proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and  would encourage companies to invest in the united states. the tax overhaul could have cut boeing’s taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a reuters analysis of boeing’s 2016 deliveries. two thirds of boeing’s jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. boeing declined to comment on the estimate. boeing would face import taxes, too. its 787 dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from japan’s mitsubishi heavy industries ltd, fuji heavy industries ltd, kawasaki heavy industries ltd and italy’s leonardo spa.  boeing also would still pay tax on sales to u.s. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally. yet suppliers say boeing’s vigorous cost saving has pressed many to outsource production to low cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax. u.s. aerospace imports have doubled the past decade, with mexico the fastest growing source, up 950 percent since 2006. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2n4a8o1) supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said david wireman, managing director and co head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm alixpartners.  “the tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships.” ",0
" u.s. president elect donald trump on wednesday announced he has chosen david shulkin, who currently heads the department of veterans affairs healthcare system, to head the agency. here is a list of republican trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration.  note: senate confirmation is required for all the posts except national security adviser and white house posts. tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at exxon mobil corp, where he rose to chairman and chief executive officer in 2006. a civil engineer by training, the texan joined the world’s largest publicly traded energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the united states as well as in yemen, thailand and russia. as exxon’s chief executive, he maintained close ties with moscow and opposed u.s. sanctions against russia for its incursion into crimea. mnuchin, 54, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and hollywood financier who spent 17 years at goldman sachs group inc before leaving the investment bank in 2002. he assembled an investor group to buy a failed california mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as onewest bank and built it into southern california’s largest bank. housing advocacy groups criticized onewest for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. mattis is a retired marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of iran and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan. a former leader of central command, which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and south asia, mattis, 66, is known by many u.s. forces by his nickname, “mad dog.” he was rebuked in 2005 for saying: “it’s fun to shoot some people.” sessions, 70, was the first u.s. senator to endorse trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. son of a country store owner, the lawmaker from alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. coats, 73, served as u.s. senator from indiana from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017, and was u.s. ambassador to germany from 2001 to 2005. he previously served as u.s. representative from indiana’s 4th congressional district. zinke, 55, a first term republican u.s. representative from montana and a member of the house subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. he has taken stances favoring the coal industry, which suffered during the obama administration. the league of conservation voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. ross, 79, heads the private equity firm wl ross & co. forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. a staunch supporter of trump, ross helped shape the trump campaign’s views on trade policy. he blames massive u.s. factory job

" the environmental protection agency has told several lawmakers it aims to end late on friday a freeze on grants and contracts that had been ordered by the white house, congressional aides said. the freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about whether there would be delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of americans at risk. the trump administration on monday asked the epa to temporarily freeze grants, contracts and interagency agreements pending a review. the epa allocates $4 billion in contracts annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing of air and water quality. the concerns were acute in flint, michigan, where children for years have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water. after representative dan kildee, whose congressional district includes flint, and michigan’s two u.s. senators wrote to president donald trump asking whether programs would be delayed, the epa told them that grants to clean up the water would be uninterrupted. congress last year approved $100 million to clean up water in flint.   the epa told some lawmakers it was continuing to award environmental program grants and revolving loan fund grants to states and tribes and was “working quickly to address issues related to other categories of grants,” aides said. but flint and other cities exposed to lead poisoning remain concerned about testing.  “the people of flint also rely on other epa contracts to conduct independent water testing and provide expertise when it comes to ensuring water quality,” said mitchell rivard, a kildee spokesman, who was waiting for news from the epa and trump about those programs. an official from another midwestern city that has suffered lead poisoning, speaking on condition of anonymity, said local politicians had asked the epa if programs would be slowed but had received no answers. a former epa head of grants said the freeze was troubling because it showed a “total lack of communication about it with states, tribes and communities.” “they’re supposed to be epa’s partners in keeping people safe and health, so they should have been consulted, or at least warned,” said karl brooks, a former acting assistant administrator at the agency. if every polluted community has to push politicians to write letters to the epa, the agency “will be spending most of its time answering congressional letters and not getting lead out of water or mercury out of our air,” he said.

" even as thousands of additional american troops head to afghanistan, a u.s. government watchdog is warning that tens of billions of dollars could be wasted unless changes are made in the training of afghan security forces. deficiencies in the afghan forces, including the military and police, are getting renewed attention after u.s. president donald trump s administration decided to send more than 3,000 additional troops to the country where the united states has been engaged in its longest war. washington has spent $70 billion training afghan forces since 2002, and is still spending more than $4 billion a year, according to a report from the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction, or sigar, published on thursday.  despite those sums, afghan security forces are struggling to prevent advances by taliban insurgents more than 16 years after the united states invaded afghanistan to topple the islamist taliban government that gave al qaeda the sanctuary where it plotted the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. according to u.s. estimates, government forces control less than 60 percent of afghanistan, with almost half the country either contested or under the control of insurgents. the report said u.s. forces focused on carrying out military operations during the initial years after the 2001 invasion, rather than developing the afghan army and police. when the united states and nato did look to develop the security forces, they did so with little input from senior afghan officials, according to the report. at one point, the report said, training for afghan police officials used power point slides from u.s. and nato operations in the balkans.  the presentations were not only of questionable relevance to the afghan setting, but also overlooked the high levels of illiteracy among the police,  the report said. john sopko, the head of sigar, said that one u.s. officer watched tv shows such as  cops  and  ncis  to understand what to teach afghan officials. sopko said the u.s. government approach to afghanistan lacked a  whole of government approach  in which different agencies such as the state department and pentagon coordinate efforts. the inability of embassy officials in kabul to venture far outside their secure compound also affected oversight and coordination, he said. the goal of u.s. policy remains enabling local forces to defeat the taliban and secure the country so economic development can proceed.  victory would look like people in the government of afghanistan (being able to) handle this threat from the terrorists, using their own security forces, with international mentors probably there for many years to come,  u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said recently. michael kugelman, a south asia specialist at the woodrow wilson center, a washington think tank, said that while the afghan forces had major shortcomings, including their ability to collect intelligence and hold territory, their progress should not be overlooked.   it is easy to forget the progress that the security forces have made amid all the doomsday rhetoric, but there have been very real improvements in the afghan security forces. for instance, the special forces have become jewel of the afghan security forces,  kugelman said. afghan president ashraf ghani said on wednesday the country s army was not only better trained and profiting from a new generation of soldiers but had gained experience after huge cuts in the u.s. led international force under former u.s. president barack obama forced afghans to assume a bigger role in the fighting.

" iran has no need to increase the range of its ballistic missiles as they could already reach u.s. forces stationed in the region, the head of the revolutionary guards said on tuesday. as u.s. president donald trump seeks to impose new sanctions against iran s missile program, major general mohammad ali jafari said  sanctions would only increase number of iranian missiles, and their precision . trump this month refused to certify tehran s compliance with a deal struck with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions. the house of representatives voted last week for new sanctions on iran s ballistic missile program and trump has urged u.s. allies to join washington in taking strong action to curb  iran s continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior , including sanctions targeting its missile development.  our missiles  range is 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), and that can be increased, but we believe this range is enough for the islamic republic as most of the u.s. forces and most of their interests in the region are within this range,  jafari was quoted as saying by tasnim news agency.  americans are trying to impose new sanctions against the revolutionary guards for its missile program, but that is an excuse to harm iran s economy,  jafari said. iran has one of the middle east s largest missile programs and some of its precision guided missiles have the range to strike israel. the united states says iran s missile program is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future.  iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian uses only.

" republican presidential front runner donald trump predicted that the united states is on course for a “very massive recession,” warning that a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump. “i think we’re sitting on an economic bubble. a financial bubble,” the billionaire businessman said in an interview with the washington post published on saturday.  coming off a tough week on the campaign trail in which he made a series of missteps, trump’s latest comments bring him back into the limelight ahead of tuesday’s important primary in wisconsin where he trails in the polls. the former reality tv star said that the real u.s. jobless figure is much higher than five percent number released by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics.  “we’re not at 5 percent unemployment,” trump said. “we’re at a number that’s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,” he said, adding that the official jobless figure is “statistically devised to make politicians — and in particular presidents — look good.”     trump said “it’s a terrible time right now” to invest in the stock market, offering a more bleak view of the u.s. economy than that held by many mainstream economists. the interview was bylined by the post’s robert costa and famed watergate reporter bob woodward.  a real estate magnate, trump has made appealing to blue collar workers a hallmark of his bid for the republican nomination for the nov. 8 presidential election, often blaming unemployment on the outsourcing of u.s. jobs and facilities to countries such as china and mexico. trump vowed in the interview to wipe out the more than $19 trillion national debt “over a period of eight years,” helped by a renegotiation of trade deals. “i’m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on,” he said. after making controversial statements about abortion last week, trump has shown little sign of heeding calls from fellow republicans to adopt a more presidential tone so as to avoid alienating voters in the november general election if he wins the nomination. on saturday, he questioned close u. s. ties to saudi arabia and again accused u.s. allies of not pulling their weight in the nato military alliance.  trump told a campaign rally in racine, wisconsin that partners in the north atlantic treaty organization “are not paying their fair share” and called the 28 nation alliance “obsolete.” “either they pay up, including for past deficiencies, or they have to get out. and if it breaks up nato, it breaks up nato,” trump said. tuesday’s wisconsin nominating contest could be a turning point in the republican race. trump, 69, trails his leading rival, u.s. senator ted cruz, 45, of texas in the state. a cruz win would make it harder for trump to reach the number of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the republican national convention in july. the winner will get to claim all of wisconsin’s 42 delegates.

" beijing s city authorities have taken down from their website a policy document put up just a few days ago that looked to help improve the city s notorious air quality by banning construction during winter months. it is unclear if the move means the prohibition is no longer in place, with an official at the beijing municipal commission of housing and urban rural development who gave his name as yu saying the document had been pulled from the website due to misunderstandings over the rules in media reports. he declined to give further details. the statement, dated sept. 15, was posted on the commission s website last friday, but it was no longer available on wednesday. it was not clear when it was withdrawn. under the plan, all construction of road and water projects, as well as demolition of housing, would be banned from nov. 15 to march 15 within the city s six major districts and surrounding suburbs. as part of dust control measures, the government often instructs construction sites in northern cities to close during bouts of heavy smog in the winter when households crank up heating, drawing on the power grid which is mainly fueled by coal. provincial authorities are rushing to enforce the central government s ambitious targets for preventing toxic air during the upcoming colder months as it has ramped up its years long war on smog. the possible pulling of the construction rules underscores the complexity of implementing some of the steps. among the most stringent measures are orders for heavy industry such as steel mills to curb output by as much as 50 percent during the colder months. recent checks of factories across the north have forced many to close or curb operations, roiling supplies of some critical raw materials like coke and coal and sending prices of base metals soaring.

" as in fighting consumes the british government, europeans have stepped up quiet preparations for a possible collapse of brexit talks that could see britain crash out of the eu without a deal 18 months from now. prime minister theresa may s eu counterparts still see the  no deal scenario  she threatened them with as most unlikely, as they think it would hurt britain much more than the continent. but after her faltering party conference this week and ahead of important meetings in brussels over the next fortnight, diplomats and officials there and in big member states said they have been putting renewed focus on contingency planning for a legal limbo in march 2019 and urging businesses to do the same. german officials say that in recent months they have been spending just as much energy on how to handle that as on preparing for a negotiated solution. the bdi industry federation in the biggest eu economy warned german firms on thursday that it would be  naive  not to be ready for a  a very hard exit . like may, who on friday rejected calls from some lawmakers to resign, michel barnier, the european union negotiator, says his aim is an orderly exit. but he repeatedly cautions that he also has a mandate from eu leaders to help prepare for failure and regularly tells businesses to be sure to plan for the worst.  we want to be ready for all eventualities, including  no deal ,  he told business and labor representatives after the negotiations began in july. deal or no deal is  the fundamental question , he said, after talks made little progress in august.  this is the growing feeling, absolutely,  a senior eu official said of concerns that talks could collapse, not because britain saw economic advantage in that, as may has warned, but because british politics could end up in domestic stalemate that could mean missing reasonable deadlines for a withdrawal treaty. for many, talk of a breakdown in talks remains part of the bluff and counter bluff of negotiations. but what may s problems inside her own government indicate to many across the channel is that the country is so divided it may be unable to reach a deal.  you need to factor in that it s not a rational process,  the senior eu official said, repeating a common view that voting for brexit made no economic sense in the first place.  so it s not unlikely that they again shy away from what are the economic imperatives and we end up cliff edging by political default.  people close to barnier s negotiating team draw attention to new legislation last month aimed at protecting the eu carbon market from a disorderly british departure and moves to force euro denominated securities clearing from london to the continent as examples of brussels  contingency planning.  it s the responsible approach. and the more it goes on like this,  said one eu official of the lack of clear breakthroughs in the talks,  the more we ll see of these steps.  another senior official said:  there s every reason to be worried and european industry should take this more seriously.  may s brexit minister, david davis, is expected back in brussels on monday for a fifth round of negotiations with barnier. but expectations among eu officials are low to nil for a breakthrough on key divorce issues that would allow eu leaders to tell may when they meet her the following week that they are willing to open talks on a future free trade accord. aside from uncertainty over how a new eu border with ireland will work and differences over rights for expatriates after brexit, a standoff over tens of billions of euros that brussels argues britain will owe on departure seems far from resolution. describing as  unbelievable arrogance  british offers to pay just 20 billion euros ($23 billion) of a  brexit bill  which the eu estimates at perhaps 60 billion euros, a senior diplomat from a country britain generally views as an ally in eu affairs said may would have to face down hardliners who reject such payments. few of britain s negotiating partners see any benefit in a change of prime minister now. that would cost more time that neither side has, since the chances of london or brussels agreeing to extend the brexit deadline seem limited.  with boris johnson as prime minister, the negotiations would be easier,  one eu diplomat said of the foreign secretary, who has sniped at may s push for a deal that could see britain stay bound by some eu rules, at least for a transition period.  we could save ourselves all this analyzing,  the diplomat said,  as he d just drive the talks straight off the cliff.  for many, ending with a legal void remains far fetched. but though british ministers talk of a  bespoke  deal to exit eu rules while retaining market access, eu officials warn that time is running out for london to find any option other than to agree to something like the status of norway   being in the eu market and accepting rules on which is has no vote.  pretty soon,  said one,  it will be norway or nothing.

" organizers barred journalists on sunday from a publicly advertised event in shanghai that offered chinese investors the chance to get u.s. immigrant visas if they put money in a real estate project linked to the family of president donald trump’s son in law. the two tower luxury apartment complex in new jersey, one journal square, is being developed by kabr group and the kushner companies, which until recently was headed by senior white house advisor jared kushner, the husband of trump’s daughter ivanka. the developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the eb 5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event’s organizer, immigration agency qiaowai. the controversial eb 5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy u.s. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. “sorry, this is a private event,” said a man stopping journalists from entering a function room at the four seasons hotel in shanghai. guests at the event said kushner’s sister, nicole kushner meyer, spoke for about 10 minutes, including about her family’s humble roots. according to the new york times, meyer attended a similar event in beijing on saturday and told the audience of about 100 people the project “means a lot to me and my entire family”. jared kushner, whose white house portfolio includes relations with china, sold his stake in kushner companies to a family trust early this year.  “mr. kushner has no involvement in the operation of kushner companies and divested his interests in the one journal square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife, and his children are not beneficiaries of, a mechanism suggested by the office of government ethics,” his lawyer, blake roberts of wilmerhale law firm, said in a statement emailed to reuters by the white house. “as previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the eb 5 visa program.” a kushner companies spokeswoman declined to comment in a new york times article about the beijing event published on saturday. the times story said meyer did not respond when asked if she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother. journalists from the times and washington post were removed from saturday’s beijing event, the newspapers reported. one potential investor, sophie xing, said a “very important” factor in her decision to attend sunday’s event was the fact the project was a kushner companies investment and that trump’s son in law’s sister would be in shanghai. “actually i really don’t know how close they are but i felt that this was a pretty good project,” she said. in a promotional text message seen by reuters, qiaowai made note of meyer’s relationship to trump and called her the event’s “heavyweight honored guest”. qiaowai representatives at the event declined to answer questions from journalists, and calls to its listed phone number went unanswered. qiaowai is also known as qwos. its promotional materials for the project, which it also calls kushner1, advertise the prospect of putting money in under the federal eb 5 program. the program is popular among wealthy chinese looking to shift assets abroad or move overseas, but it has come under fire in the united states. some u.s. lawmakers have called for changing or abolishing  the eb 5 program, but the scheme was recently renewed by congress until sept. 30. potential investor xing said a kushner representative who spoke on sunday stressed that eb 5 rules could change after september to raise the minimum required investment. another person who attended sunday’s event, liu guoqi, was mindful of the potential rule change. liu said he had been to previous pitches for eb 5 investments but had concerns about the risks. “the whole thing may change later this year so we feel that there isn’t much time left,” he said. in the united states, the eb 5 program has also sparked concerns about possible scams. some immigrants have been burned by misrepresentations made about the program by promoters, both inside and outside the united states. many have lost not only their money but their chance at winning u.s. citizenship. trump has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration. in addition to beijing and shanghai, the road show for one journal square was scheduled to visit the chinese cities of shenzhen, guangzhou and wuhan, according to qiaowai’s marketing materials online. it calls the kushner family a “famous real estate clan”, and touts eb 5 immigration as “peace of mind”. qiaowai’s chinese language marketing material describes the project as “supported by the government, created by a star developer”, and says the project is its 87th eb 5 program.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions, taking up an issue that has infuriated republican president donald trump, went on the attack against leaks on friday, warning of a possible crackdown both on reporters and their sources inside the federal government. in a move derided by critics as an attack on the free press, sessions said the administration was reviewing policies on forcing journalists to reveal their sources.  it is, however, difficult to prosecute members of the news media in the united states for publishing leaked information. sessions also told the employees of government agencies to stop leaking and called the issue a matter of national security.     trump has repeatedly voiced anger over a steady stream of leaks to the media about him and his administration since he took office in january.  some have been related to probes into russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election; others have concerned infighting in the white house.     “one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas,” sessions told reporters as he announced administration efforts to battle what he called a “staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country.” “we respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited,” the nation’s top law official said.  his boss, trump, has repeatedly criticized news outlets and their work as “fake news,” and administration officials have criticized the use of anonymous sources, a standard journalistic practice. a media subpoena is a writ compelling a journalist to testify or produce evidence, with a penalty for failure to do so.  the fact that the administration is reviewing its policy leaves open the possibility of sentencing journalists for not disclosing their sources.     “every american should be concerned about the trump administration’s threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists,” said ben wizner of the american civil liberties union. “a crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole.” deputy attorney general rod rosenstein told reporters the department was just starting to review the policy on media subpoenas and could not say yet how it might be changed. but he did not rule out the possibility of threatening journalists with jail time.     historically, government employees or contractors who give sensitive information to the media are much more likely to be prosecuted than the reporters who receive it. u.s. regulations give journalists special protections, barring them from law enforcement that might “reasonably impair newsgathering activities.” federal prosecutors must get special permission from the u.s. attorney general before issuing a subpoena to try to force a member of the news media to divulge information to authorities. new york times reporter judith miller was jailed in 2005 for refusing to reveal a source about stories on iraq, but she cut a deal with prosecutors before she was formally charged.   in addressing the wider issue of leaks, sessions said the justice department has tripled the number of investigations into unauthorized leaks of classified information and that four people have already been charged. “we are taking a stand,” said sessions, who in recent weeks has been publicly criticized by trump for his performance in the job, including for what trump called his weakness on the issue of going after leakers. “this culture of leaking must stop,” sessions said. it is not illegal to leak information, as such, but divulging classified information is against the law. some of the more high profile leaks in the trump administration have revealed white house infighting in articles that would appear not to involve divulging classified information.         sessions did not immediately give the identities of the four people charged, but said they had been accused of unlawfully disclosing classified information or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers. rosenstein did not give the exact number of leak investigations the justice department is currently handling, only that this number has tripled under the trump administration.  in the latest major leak to the media, the washington post published transcripts on thursday of contentious phone calls that trump had in the early days of his administration with mexican president enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull. “no government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence or to talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders,” sessions said of that case.     one tool sessions has for prosecuting leakers is the espionage act, a world war one era law that was designed to stop leaks to america’s enemies. federal prosecutors have used it 12 times to charge individuals for disclosing information to the media, eight of them under democratic former president barack obama.   the most recent case, and the first under trump, was the justice department’s indictment in june of reality leigh winner, 25, a u.s. intelligence contractor accused of leaking a classified national security agency report about russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election.

" a south sudanese rebel group on friday accused government troops of attacking their base only a day after the parties signed a ceasefire in a four year war that has killed tens of thousands of people.  the ceasefire, that would allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting, formally comes into force on sunday morning.  on friday afternoon, a spokesman for the spla io rebel group said army forces had attacked a rebel base in deim jalab, in the western part of the country. lam paul gabriel said two rebels and five government troops were killed in the fighting. the army spokesman in the capital, juba, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the war that began in late 2013 in the world s youngest nation has forced a third of the population to flee their homes. the united nations describes the violence as ethnic cleansing.  earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine. the latest round of talks in the ethiopian capital,  convened by the east african bloc igad, brought the warring sides back to the negotiating table after a 2015 peace deal collapsed last year during heavy fighting in juba. after the new agreement was signed on thursday, south sudan s information minister michael makuei leuth told journalists:  the cessation of hostilities will be effective 72 hours from now. as of now, we will send messages to all the commands in the field to abide by this cessation of hostilities.   from now onwards, there will be no more fighting,  he added.  just talks.  the german foreign ministry welcomed the agreement as an important step toward bringing peace to south sudan.  we call on all participating parties to implement the agreement in a comprehensive and sustainable manner, and to ensure that humanitarian organizations are not hindered in doing their work,  a ministry spokeswoman said.

"it is truly a shame that our nation has $25 million dollars to waste on phony climate change.  that money could  have gone a long way in helping children and adults who are suffering and dying of malnourishment. this president and the democrats who support his phony war on climate change should be ashamed of themselves. a $25 million u.s.-funded project to help guatemala combat global warming is being slammed as another taxpayer-backed boondoggle after a new audit highlighted a series of problems   including numerous inaccuracies in the group s work and a failure to produce a required long-term plan.without the plan, the government audit warned,  the funds   could be wasted. the grant for the climate, nature and communities in guatemala program was awarded to the nonprofit rainforest alliance in february 2013 by the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) as part of a broader effort to fight climate change abroad.meanwhile, guatemala is ranked as the 7th poorest nation in the world. parentless children like elvin usaid s office of inspector general, which issued the audit last month, said the program was set up to help organizations and small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in guatemala improve climate-change strategies and strengthen local ngos so the country s environment could be conserved without future u.s. assistance. the report noted that as of february 2015, $10.5 million had been disbursed so far.the audit acknowledged the program was making  some progress,  but it also alleged a laundry list of violations   including that the reported results were not accurate.the watchdog reported that data-testing revealed 22 errors in the accounting of whether the program was on track.one example given was that the rainforest alliance reported 162,356 hectares of land now devoted to timber and nontimber products such as cacao and honey. but a review found the group had counted the same hectares multiple times.the rainforest alliance also reported it had created 30,149 part-time and permanent jobs  generated through new sustainable, productive activities undertaken by program-assisted community-based organizations and smes.  however, the audit found 23,936 of those  jobs  may have lasted no more than a day.the audit also found that a required comprehensive  sustainability plan  on how the program will continue after usaid s assistance ends was not completed, despite it being required and the project having been underway for two years. without a sustainability plan, the funds used to help the guatemalan government and other partners manage the country s natural resources to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change could be wasted,  the report said.the report was first flagged by judicial watch, a conservative watchdog group which called the project an  egregious waste of taxpayer dollars  and  par for the course with virtually all of the obama administration s  green  ventures, which have largely failed after getting hundreds of millions in federal funds. among other violations, the audit also found that while the rainforest alliance was supposed to contribute at least $3.75 million as a form of cost-sharing, the $1.79 million it reported as having contributed by december 2014 included $26,708 of u.s. funds it received under a separate project.the auditors also found that participants didn t undergo background checks, breaking a government funding rule that background checks must be performed on anyone seeking to participate in usaid-sponsored training.   fox newsif you d like to help one or more of these malnourished children in guatemala, click here to donate.",1

" if u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump wins the election in november, it would be problematic for the entire world and encourage copycats in europe, european parliament president martin schulz told a german magazine. “trump is not only a problem for the eu but also for the whole world,” schulz said in an interview with der spiegel published online on thursday. “if a man who shows off by not having a clue and by saying that specialist knowledge is elitist rubbish ends up in the white house, a critical point will have been reached,” said schulz, a german center left social democrat. such a scenario would mean that there is an “obviously irresponsible man” sitting in a position that demands the utmost sense of responsibility, schulz said. he added that he was concerned that trump getting into power would spur on copycats in europe. “that’s why i want hillary clinton to win.” ",0

" u.s. president elect donald trump said on thursday night he would nominate retired marine corps general james mattis, known as “mad dog” and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan, to lead the pentagon. “we are going to appoint ‘mad dog’ mattis as our secretary of defense,” trump told a rally in cincinnati. he said the formal announcement would be made on monday. the choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that trump, a republican, intends to steer u.s. foreign policy away from democratic president barack obama’s increased reliance on u.s. allies to fight islamist militants and to help deter russian and chinese aggression in europe and asia. mattis is a revered figure in the marine corps and known for his distrust of iran. the washington post and cnn reported earlier that trump had chosen mattis, but trump spokesman jason miller said earlier on twitter that “no decision has been made yet with regard to secretary of defense.” while the nomination of the 66 year old mattis would likely be popular among u.s. forces, it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle.   because he retired only in 2013, mattis would need the u.s. congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the pentagon. his impressive combat record, however, may deter some senate democrats from trying to block his nomination. trump has described mattis as “a true general’s general.”  the new york real estate magnate famously asserted last year: “i know more about isis than the generals do.” mattis, whose past assignments include leading central command, which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and south asia, is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the u.s. armed forces: fighting wars. in one famous line in 2003 attributed to mattis, the general told marines in iraq: “be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” in a 2016 question and answer session, mattis appeared to be moved by a marine’s question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand, known as a “kill casualty radius.” “once you get to be a high ranking officer, the kill casualty radius is whatever your marines make it, and by the time i got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles,” he said in a video for the marine corps. still, such tough talk has gotten him in hot water. he was once rebuked for saying in 2005 that “it’s fun to shoot some people.”  his talk, however, belies a more thoughtful side. mattis once said the most important 6 inches in a combat zone was “between your ears.” now a fellow at stanford university’s hoover institution, mattis is also a scholar who was praised by then u.s. defense secretary robert gates in 2010 as one of the country’s great strategic thinkers.  mattis reads avidly, frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television.  after meeting mattis on nov. 19, trump described him as a strong, dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone’s face to simulate drowning.  trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding, which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under president barack obama, but bring back “a hell of a lot worse” if elected.  “(mattis) said: ‘i’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with torture.’ and i was very impressed by that answer,” trump told the new york times. the senate armed services committee will consider mattis’ nomination. in a statement on thursday night, its chairman, republican john mccain, called him “one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.”  mattis would be the first former u.s. general to become defense secretary since george c. marshall took the job in 1950. the decision adds to trump’s national security team another pentagon veteran who served during the obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it. officials who knew him before he retired in 2013 said mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed central command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from iran and to win more resources for afghanistan. trump has given the job of national security adviser to michael flynn, a retired three star army general who was pushed out of the top job at the defense intelligence agency in 2014 by obama’s administration.  flynn was fiercely critical of obama during the 2016 campaign, adopting much of trump’s rhetoric. along with flynn and trump’s choice for cia director, u.s. representative mike pompeo, mattis has been critical of the deal to curb iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program, saying the threat from tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about islamic state or al qaeda. “the iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the middle east,” mattis said. speaking about the iranian nuclear deal, mattis said: “hoping that iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible, modern nation is a bridge too far.” if mattis wins senate confirmation, he will work side by side with another marine   general joseph dunford, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.  having two marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite u.s. fighting force. it would also raise questions about how mattis and dunford might divide up tasks.  both dunford and mattis share battlefield experience, including in iraq. in 2003, mattis led the 1st marine division during the u.s. led invasion of iraq. he has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of falluja in 2004, something he feared would hurt morale, but did not. “we just don’t take refuge in self pity or any of that kind of stuff. and so as a result, the marine corps remains a very feared organization in this world. as it should be,” he said.

" wary of german chancellor angela merkel s ambition for closer european union integration, right wing politicians in the eu s eastern wing are touting her weak election victory as a vindication of their concerns. eurosceptic governments in poland and hungary have been vocal in criticizing merkel s  open door  approach to migration and opposing eu reforms that would transfer more power to the brussels institutions at the expense of national governments. poland s foreign minister said germany s sept. 24 election, in which merkel s conservative bloc won the lowest number of votes since 1949, was proof that berlin would have to heed the concerns of eastern member states.  she should focus on maintaining the unity of the european union,  witold waszczykowski told polska the times newspaper.  mrs merkel will have to look for new allies   and this in turn opens room for maneuver for polish diplomacy.   today, there is no climate for federalization and there won t be one in the nearest future.  merkel is expected to take months to build a new coalition government, reducing german pressure on warsaw and budapest to comply with eu standards. her most likely coalition allies are the increasingly eurosceptic, pro business free democrats and the greens   but she also faces a more divided bundestag lower house, where the  anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) is now the third biggest party. nationalist politicians in the eu s eastern member states hope the rise of the afd, the first far right party to enter the bundestag in decades, will force merkel to harden her stance on immigration after germany admitted more than one million migrants and refugees, mostly muslims, in 2015 16. hungary has already said german politicians since the election have endorsed its measures to beef up its border security to discourage migrants from entering the eu.  about some aspects of illegal migration we are still in debate, but there is full agreement on the principal issue that the protection of the external borders of europe is very important,  foreign minister peter szijjarto said after meeting senior german lawmakers in the city of stuttgart last week. the head of the european commission, jean claude juncker, has invited the leaders of the four  visegrad  states   poland, hungary, the czech republic and slovakia   to a dinner in brussels on oct. 18, ahead of an eu summit, to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western europe. hungarian prime minister viktor orban s fidesz party and merkel s cdu csu are in the same political family in the european parliament, and despite berlin s criticism of his record in government, has welcomed merkel s election victory.   let s quietly pray every evening for the extension of the mandate of the current chancellor,  he said before the election. orban himself faces an election next april in which he will seek a third consecutive term, and he probably does not want to tackle eu reform issues head on now, analysts said.   orban s objective is to keep the margin of maneuver open  as long as possible: he does not want to face yes or no questions like whether to take hungary into the euro zone or stay on the periphery anytime soon,  botond feledy, senior fellow at the centre for euro atlantic integration and democracy in budapest.  german french axis but once merkel has bedded down a new coalition in berlin, budapest and warsaw can expect a resumption of pressure over their record on democracy and rule of law from a reinvigorated partnership between germany and emmanuel macron s france. analysts said merkel and macron, both keen to overcome eu disunity, may try to pick off more cooperative eastern states such as slovakia and the czech republic in order to concentrate pressure on poland and hungary to comply with eu rules. merkel may also in due course revive her demands on the eastern states to take in more migrants as she seeks to blunt the allure of the afd at home for conservative german voters. warsaw, currently under an unprecedented eu investigation over its rule of law standards, is bracing for renewed criticism.  we are expecting merkel to get tough on poland   definitely not in the next few months while the new government is being formed, but after the domestic dust has settled,  a polish government source added.

" colombia s senate has backed a law to regulate transitional justice under the country s peace deal with marxist farc rebels, including special tribunals that will try guerrilla leaders for war crimes.  the law, approved late on wednesday, is considered the cornerstone of the agreement signed last year between the government and the farc, known then as the revolutionary armed forces of colombia. the measure still needs approval from the lower house of congress, which is likely to vote on it early next week. the special courts will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex guerrilla leaders who are convicted of war crimes. under the peace deal, those convicted will not serve time in traditional jails. the law can also apply to members of the military and civilians who funded illegal groups like paramilitaries. congress has until the end of the month to approve the law using the court approved  fast track  mechanism to reduce the number of required debates in an effort to implement the peace accord as quickly as possible. in a move that invigorated the previously slow debate in the senate chamber, the nation s top court ruled this week that the majority of the law, including provisions that allow former rebels to participate in politics, is constitutional.  the court made several modifications however. a provision in the agreement prohibits extradition of former farc members, but the ruling said that only applied to crimes that occurred before the deal. it said ex rebels who commit crimes after demobilization would be subject to regular laws that include the possibility of extradition.  that did not sit well with the farc, which is now officially a political party.  the extradition prohibition as it stands in the final accord is a right and not a benefit,  senior farc member ivan marquez told journalists on thursday.  making the prohibition ineffectual constitutes a flagrant and very grave non compliance with the deal.  under the agreement the farc will have 10 guaranteed seats in congress until 2026. the group has already announced a slate of candidates for elections next year.

" the saudi led military coalition fighting houthi rebels in yemen said on wednesday it would allow humanitarian aid access through yemen s port of hodeidah and united nations flights to the capital sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country. the coalition closed air, land and sea access to the arabian peninsula country on nov. 6 to stop the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. the action came after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh. iran has denied supplying the houthis with weapons. soon after the closure, u.n. aid chief mark lowcock warned that the blockade could spark  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims  unless the coalition gave access to humanitarian aid.  the saudi led coalition said in a statement on wednesday that from nov. 23 the red sea port of hodeidah would be reopened to receive food aid and humanitarian relief, and sanaa airport would be open for un flights with humanitarian relief.   we re monitoring these developments,  u.n. spokesman farhan haq told reporters in new york.  if that were to happen that would be a very welcome and critically important development.   we made clear the tremendous amount of needs on the ground,  haq said.  earlier this month the coalition said it would allow aid deliveries through the government held port of aden. however, around 80 percent of yemen s food imports arrive through hodeidah. the united nations has said some seven million people in yemen are on the brink of famine and nearly 900,000 have been infected with cholera, a waterborne disease that causes acute diarrhea and dehydration. aid groups said there also needed to be commercial access to yemen for food and fuel shipments.  humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the needs of yemenis who are unjustly bearing the brunt of this war,  paolo cernuschi, yemen country director at the international rescue committee, said in a statement.  jan egeland, secretary general of the norwegian refugee council and a former u.n. aid chief, posted on twitter,  we need all ports to open and access for commercial food and supplies to large civilian population. humanitarian aid alone cannot avert hunger.   the international committee of the red cross (icrc) said on wednesday that it had evacuated from sanaa five staff members in need of urgent medical assistance. the saudi led coalition has been targeting the houthis since they seized parts of yemen in 2015, including the capital sanaa, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee. the houthis, drawn mainly from yemen s zaidi shi ite minority and allied with long serving former president ali abdullah saleh, control much of the country.

" a display of u.s. state flags in a tunnel under washington’s capitol complex will be replaced because of controversial confederate symbols on some of the flags, an administrative committee said on thursday. in its place, in the busy passageway between the capitol and adjacent office buildings, depictions of commemorative quarters representing the 50 states, the u.s. territories and washington, d.c., will be installed, said committee on house administration chairwoman candice miller. michigan republican representative miller said in a statement that she decided to replace the display because of the controversy surrounding the confederate flag, which is widely seen today as a symbol of racism and slavery.  “i am well aware of how many americans negatively view the confederate flag, and, personally, i am very sympathetic to these views,” she said. lawmakers who choose to hang their home states’ flags outside their offices may still do so. “in this way all state flags are displayed on capitol hill,” miller said.   only the mississippi state flag still depicts the confederate battle flag, in the top left corner. symbols from various confederate flags are evident in the flags of alabama, florida, georgia and arkansas. all these states were among those that seceded from the union in 1860 1861 and joined the pro slavery confederate states of america that was defeated by the anti slavery union in the american civil war. representative bennie thompson, a mississippi democrat who pushed last year for his state’s flag to be removed from the capitol, praised miller’s announcement as a step toward removing all signs of the “confederate revolt against our own country.” criticism over public display of the confederate flag  intensified last year after a white man who gunned down nine black churchgoers in south carolina was pictured on social media with it. u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan, a wisconsin republican, told a weekly news conference that he supports the decision to change the display. it is expected to be installed once renovations of the tunnel are finished later this year.

" a leading member of greece s most deadly guerrilla group, november 17, began a two day leave from prison on thursday under a parole board ruling that triggered a storm of protest and expressions of regret from britain and the united states. dimitris koufodinas is serving several life terms for his role in the marxist group that operated for almost three decades until greek authorities arrested its leaders in 2002.  its targets ranged from businessmen to diplomats. its first victim was a cia station chief in 1975, and its last a british embassy defense attache in 2000. prison authorities granted his request for temporary leave from jail on condition he report to a police station twice a day. it is his first such leave since he was jailed in 2003 and authorities said it was in compliance with regulations applying to all inmates. but the release comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is frequently accused by opposition parties of being soft on anti establishment groups with roots in leftist radicalism and anarchy. conservative lawmaker dora bakoyannis, whose husband pavlos bakoyannis was gunned down by november 17 in 1989, was visibly angry during a live broadcast after his release from jail.  he isn t just any terrorist. he was a leader, the ideological guide, the guy who wrote a book who said that after the murder (of bakoyannis) he went to a tavern and celebrated. while my children were crying,  she told skai tv. geoffrey pyatt, the u.s. ambassador to greece, said in a tweet the decision was a  dishonor  to the memory of victims and their families. british ambassador smith said she was  deeply disappointed  and shared the victims  pain. both envoys carried photos of plaques at their respective embassies commemorating november 17 victims.  members of november 17 eluded capture for years. the country has a history of political violence and still has urban guerrilla groups, though none as deadly as november 17.  koufodinas, an amateur beekeeper known as  poison hand  for the precision of his aim, has been kept at a high security jail in athens for 15 years. there, he wrote two books, one called  i was born november 17 , and the second  13 answers . in a high profile trial in 2003, 15 people, including koufodinas, were found guilty over the 23 killings and dozens of bomb attacks claimed by the guerrilla group.  a government official said authorities followed procedure.  i am not going to defend the practice, the deeds, nor the ideology of mr koufodinas,  he told real fm radio.  what i can say as a comment is that in this specific case the law was applied to the letter, and the preconditions were met for granting leave.  the group took its name from the date of a 1973 student uprising against the military dictatorship. it is normally marked every nov. 17 with street protests in athens.

" u.s. president donald trump told a group of senators on tuesday that he expected lawmakers would be able to reach a deal on healthcare, without offering specifics on how they would do it or what had changed since a healthcare reform bill was pulled last week for insufficient support. “i have no doubt that that’s going to happen very quickly,” trump said at a bipartisan reception held for senators and their spouses at the white house. “i think it’s going to happen because we’ve all been promising   democrat, republican   we’ve all been promising that to the american people,” he said. a republican plan backed by trump to overhaul the u.s. healthcare system was pulled on friday after it failed to garner enough support to pass the republican controlled house of representatives. trump, a republican, did not mention that failure at the reception nor did he offer specifics on how he planned for lawmakers to reach a consensus on a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the affordable care act, familiarly known as obamacare.  trump told lawmakers at the reception that he would be talking about infrastructure and investing in the military, without offering a time frame or details. “hopefully, it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. we want greatness for this country that we love,” he said.

" kenya s chief prosecutor has directed the department of criminal investigations and the anti corruption commission to investigate election board officials over possible offences in the invalidated aug. 8 presidential vote, he said in a letter. keriako tobiko, the director of public prosecutions, also asked the two agencies to examine allegations that two senior opposition officials gained illegal access to servers of the election commission as the poll results were being tallied. the supreme court annulled the re election of president uhuru kenyatta on sept. 1, citing irregularities and illegalities in the transmission of results, and ordered a repeat election within 60 days. in its detailed ruling last wednesday, the court said it had not found evidence of individual culpability among election board officials, adding the failings were institutional. tobiko said in the letter seen by reuters on sunday that the court not finding individual culpability did not stop him from carrying out an investigation. opposition leader raila odinga, who petitioned against kenyatta s win, has said he will not participate in the re run scheduled for oct. 26 if officials at the election board are not sacked and prosecuted. the election board got the backing of africa s intergovernmental authority on development (igad). the group, whose observation mission gave last month s poll a clean bill of health, said it was confident the board could manage a repeat the election well, warning against attempts to prevent it from carrying out its mandate.  sabotaging iebc (election board) or boycotting the elections will put kenya in a constitutional crisis and likely on a path to unconstitutional change of government,  igad said in a statement published in local newspapers.  tobiko ordered that 11 officials at the board, including its chief executive and a commissioner, be investigated over possible crimes and a report sent to him within 21 days. he also ordered that odinga s lead lawyer in the petition, james orengo, and musalia mudavadi, one of odinga s top campaigners, be investigated for allegations of illegally accessing the election board s servers and threatening kenyatta s chief agent during last month s vote. on sunday, the local standard newspaper reported that kenyatta s legal team was preparing to lodge an application for a judicial review of the ruling that overturned his win. citing a top official of kenyatta s jubilee party, the paper said the move was informed by details contained in two dissenting opinions from the six judge bench that heard the case.  kenyatta s team will seek a recount of the ballots since the court, in the majority of four ruling, annulled the vote on a basis other than a dispute over the number of votes each candidate got, the standard reported. jubilee officials did not answer calls from reuters seeking immediate comment.

" donald trump’s support has surged and he is now running nearly even with democrat hillary clinton among likely u.s. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became the republican party’s presumptive presidential nominee, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday.  the results could signal a close fight between the two likely white house rivals as americans make up their minds ahead of the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. as recently as last week, clinton led trump by around 13 points in the poll.  in the most recent survey, 41 percent of likely voters supported clinton, the democratic front runner, and 40 percent backed trump, with 19 percent not decided on either yet, according to the online poll of 1,289 people conducted from friday to tuesday. the poll had a credibility interval of about 3 percentage points.  the results reflect a big increase in support for trump since he knocked out u.s. senator ted cruz of texas and ohio governor john kasich last week to become the last republican in the white house race.  there was no immediate comment from the clinton or trump campaigns.  clinton, who has all but clinched the democratic nomination over rival bernie sanders, has mostly led trump in the head to head poll this year. trump briefly matched her support a few times in 2016, most recently in mid march, after u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, a favorite of the republican establishment, dropped out.

" airlines were racing against the clock to clear as many customers as possible from the likely florida path of hurricane irma, as social and political pressure mounted for carriers to play a bigger role in aiding evacuations. as the powerful storm threatened to rip through the florida coast by sunday, airlines ramped up the number of flights available out of south florida airports, where operations were likely to temporarily cease through the weekend and beyond.  but flights out of the area remained extremely limited. at miami international airport, many outbound flights were canceled, leaving residents scrambling to rebook to anywhere outside the path of the storm.  american airlines, which has one of the larger operations in south florida, said on thursday it had added 16 flights out of miami, amid more than 2,400 forced cancellations through monday. delta air lines inc said it had upsized aircraft and added flights to increase the number of available outgoing seats by 2,000. united airlines added six flights out of miami to its hubs, including newark, new jersey, and chicago o hare. all three carriers said they planned to mostly wind down south florida operations by friday evening. in areas already pummeled by the powerful storm, flight operations had been rolled back and halted altogether.  a delta operated flight from new york to san juan, puerto rico, and back, made headlines for narrowly avoiding the storm in a mission to evacuate another plane full of passengers from the area ahead of irma s landfall.  flight tracking website flightradar24.com saw the plane land for one last departure in the u.s. territory located squarely in the path of irma s landfall, fill with passengers, and make its successful flight back to new york on wednesday. other airlines had already ceased operations in the region. price gouging  as residents sought to secure last minute flights out of the dangerous category 5 storm s path, airlines faced accusations of trying to capitalize on the panic and chaos by price gouging.   under pressure from some members of congress following social media reports, airlines have taken the unusual step of publicly announcing price caps on tickets out of areas in irma s course. early on, carrier jetblue capped flights out of the area at $99, and other carriers followed suit, capping fares at between $99 and $399 a ticket.  but while airlines offered some cheap flights out of south florida after complaints, passengers said that did little good if all the flights were fully booked or canceled.                         medical student eric slabaugh said he was dismayed by ticket prices over $2,000 when he started looking for flights earlier this week. he got a ticket to detroit for $700, he said,  because nobody wants to go there.                          publix can t charge $50 for a case of water without getting accused of price gouging, but airlines can charge 50 times the price of a normal ticket. i don t think that s fair,  slabaugh said. airlines  customer service practices have come under fire in recent months, and just last year, u.s. carriers were cleared in a federal investigation regarding exorbitant fare mark ups in the wake of a deadly amtrak derailment that drove up demand for air travel on some routes.  senator bill nelson, a florida democrat who had been pressuring airlines to aid in evacuating florida residents, spoke with airline executives on thursday and urged them to add more flight outs of florida.   his office said nelson is  pleased  airlines were doing everything they could to  help get impacted floridians to safety.  the federal aviation administration is holding twice daily phone calls with airlines to talk about airport conditions, but does not plan to close the miami airport on friday, officials said. airlines are still planning for airport closures, however, and said they expect their operations to be impacted in the region at least through the weekend.  also affected by the storm, carnival cruise lines, which has major operations out of florida ports, said on thursday it had canceled four of its caribbean cruises, though it still planned to operate several more under modified itineraries.

" a plague epidemic in madagascar has killed 124 people since august in an outbreak that has hit the island s two main cities the hardest, the authorities said on wednesday.     plague is endemic in madagascar, but the outbreak that has caused 1,192 suspected cases since august is especially worrying because it started earlier in the season than usual and has hit urban rather than rural areas. in addition, two thirds of the cases are of the pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease.  the total number of cases (1,192) is already three times higher than the average annual total,  the national office for risk and disaster management said in a report on wednesday. last week a world health organization report said the death toll stood at 94. the capital antananarivo and toamasina,  the two largest cities in madagascar, an island in the indian ocean, were the most affected, with 55 percent of cases recorded there. to date 54 medical staff have been infected, it said. the report said that of an estimated $9.5 million in aid needed to counter the epidemic, only $3 million has been raised.

" a watchdog agency at the u.s. department of homeland security said it is planning to review how president donald trump’s immigration executive order to temporarily suspend travel from seven majority muslim nations was implemented. the review of friday’s order was being planned “in response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints,” the dhs’s office of inspector general said in a statement late wednesday.  the watchdog agency would also look at “dhs’ adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of dhs personnel,” the statement said. “if circumstances warrant, the oig will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.” the order, which barred syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90 day suspension on people from seven predominantly muslim countries, triggered widespread protests and caused confusion for travelers around the world. it also spurred several legal challenges, in particular over the initial detention or barring from flights of legal permanent residents who hold u.s. green cards. the department does not comment on investigations by the office of the inspector general.  homeland security secretary john kelly said on tuesday that no member of the homeland security team intentionally ignored a court order and that the department was in compliance with judicial orders on immigration.  the white house said on wednesday it had issued updated guidance making clear green card holders would not need a waiver to enter the united states. in california, a federal judge in los angeles ruled that trump’s administration must allow immigrants with initial clearance for legal residency to enter the united states despite the ban. massachusetts, new york, virginia and washington state have also challenged the order. ali vayeghan, an iranian citizen and u.s. visa holder who was forced out of the country last week, became on thursday the first person allowed back into united states because of the california court action. vayeghan declined to comment on trump or the order when speaking with reporters at los angeles international airport but said through an interpreter, “this is what human rights look like.” the oig statement said it would provide a final report to kelly, the u.s. congress and the public after its review but didn’t say how long the review would take. dhs includes the customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement agencies. democratic u.s. senators tammy duckworth and dick durbin had sought the investigation. “though i’m encouraged by the dhs inspector general’s decision to investigate the chaotic implementation of this un american and unconstitutional executive order, i will continue to fight for it to be revoked,” durbin said in a statement.

" donald trump’s presidential campaign is likely to launch a small donor fundraising effort akin to the grassroots one that powered another insurgent presidential contender, democrat bernie sanders, according to two top donors who attended the first official meeting of trump’s national finance team.  the trump finance machine kickoff took place at new york city’s four seasons hotel amid growing concerns about the republican presidential candidate’s lack of a campaign infrastructure heading into a nov. 8 election battle against presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton. “the pitch to this group in the room was a traditional pitch, but the backroom discussion was, because of this being a populist movement, there’s going to be significant outreach to, you know, those who give $1, $2, $20,” said trump texas fundraising co chairman gaylord hughey. “there’s a huge opportunity there.” sanders, who has effectively lost the 2016 presidential nomination to clinton, broke fundraising records during his long shot bid for the presidency, collecting more than $210 million through more than 7.4 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece.    trump could well find his supporters eager to pitch in $1, $5 or $20. for a story in may, reuters found that nearly all three dozen trump supporters it interviewed were not only unmoved by trump’s about face to accept money from outside donors, they said they would also happily contribute. the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about replicating the fundraising apparatus of sanders, a democratic socialist u.s. senator from vermont. some donors were fearful of the late start of thursday’s gathering. normally such a meeting would take place two years earlier in a candidate’s campaign. but others in attendance said they left assured that trump would be able to easily plug into the republican national committee’s robust infrastructure. trump, a wealthy businessman, became the presumptive republican nominee last month after seeing off 16 rivals in a largely self funded primary campaign. the gathering featured talks by trump, campaign manager corey lewandowski, chief strategist paul manafort, republican national committee chairman reince priebus, former rival turned ally governor chris christie of new jersey and republican fundraisers ray washburne and lew eisenberg. trump’s late start on fundraising has raised questions about whether he can achieve his previously stated aim of raising $1 billion before november. on the democratic side, clinton’s well oiled operation is well ahead of schedule. trump is also pulling back from his earlier statements on his fundraising goal. campaign manager lewandowski told reuters on wednesday that he sees no need for trump to raise that sum and that trump may be able to stick to his low cost style of campaigning. that includes garnering free media, which is estimated will reach a value of $5 billion by november, according to media analytics firm mediaquant. that is more than double what clinton is likely to get, mediaquant says. while trump shot to the top of the republican race with freewheeling rhetoric, insults of rivals and promises to get tough on issues such as illegal immigration, even his biggest donors say they are discouraged by the candidate’s attacks in recent weeks on a mexican american judge. in comments that have been widely condemned, trump has suggested that u.s. federal judge gonzalo curiel, who is presiding over a case against trump university, has an inherent bias because of his heritage. “he needs to stop the campaign infighting, shut up and stop calling an american who was born in indiana a mexican,” said texas billionaire doug deason.

" modernizing and maintaining the u.s. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years will cost more than $1.2 trillion, according to a report released on tuesday by the congressional budget office. the report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the u.s. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the u.s. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field. the cbo study reviewed the obama’s administration’s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. president donald trump in january directed secretary of defense james mattis to conduct his own review the u.s. nuclear forces. the results could be published in the coming months.  u.s. house armed services committee member adam smith, a democrat from washington, said of the obama era plan: “congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade offs with other national security efforts will be.”  the report said costs would rise from $29 billion in 2017 to $47 billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50 billion a year through the early 2030s. trump has said he wants to ensure the u.s. nuclear arsenal is at the “top of the pack,” saying the united states has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. u.s. officials have noted that america’s nuclear modernization is lagging behind russia’s upgrade of its own nuclear triad. general paul selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told congress in august he believed moscow was already two thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process. in august, the u.s. air force awarded boeing co and northrop grumman corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging minuteman iii intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.  days later the air force awarded lockheed martin corp and raytheon co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the agm 86b air launched nuclear cruise missile. that detailed development contract allows the companies to continue work on the long range standoff weapon yet another leg of the triad.

" more than 2,600 houses have been burned down in rohingya majority areas of myanmar s northwest in the last week, the government said on saturday, in one of the deadliest bouts of violence involving the muslim minority in decades. about 58,600 rohingya have fled into neighbouring bangladesh from myanmar, according to u.n. refugee agency unhcr, as aid workers there struggle to cope. myanmar officials blamed the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) for the burning of the homes. the group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter offensive.  but rohingya fleeing to bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the myanmar army is aimed at trying to force them out. the treatment of myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader aung san suu kyi, accused by western critics of not speaking out for the muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. former colonial power britain said on saturday it hoped suu kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  aung san suu kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age, but the treatment of the rohingya is, alas, besmirching the reputation of burma,  foreign minister boris johnson said in a statement. the clashes and army crackdown have killed nearly 400 people and more than 11,700  ethnic residents  have been evacuated from the area, the government said, referring to the non muslim residents. it marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since october, when a smaller rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  a total of 2,625 houses from kotankauk, myinlut and kyikanpyin villages and two wards in maungtaw were burned down by the arsa extremist terrorists,  the state run global new light of myanmar said. the group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government.  but human rights watch, which analysed satellite imagery and accounts from rohingya fleeing to bangladesh, said the myanmar security forces deliberately set the fires. new satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of devastation in northern rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought,  said the group s deputy asia director, phil robertson. near the naf river separating myanmar and bangladesh, new arrivals in bangladesh carrying their belongings in sacks set up crude tents or tried to squeeze into available shelters or homes of locals.   the existing camps are near full capacity and numbers are swelling fast. in the coming days there needs to be more space,  said unhcr regional spokeswoman vivian tan, adding more refugees were expected.  the rohingya are denied citizenship in myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor south asian country after fleeing myanmar since the early 1990s. jalal ahmed, 60, who arrived in bangladesh on friday with a group of about 3,000 after walking from kyikanpyin for almost a week, said he believed the rohingya were being pushed out of myanmar.   the military came with 200 people to the village and started fires...all the houses in my village are already destroyed. if we go back there and the army sees us, they will shoot,  he said.  reuters could not independently verify these accounts as access for independent journalists to northern rakhine has been restricted since security forces locked down the area in october. speaking to soldiers, government staff and rakhine buddhists affected by the conflict on friday, army chief min aung hlaing said there is no  oppression or intimidation  against the muslim minority and  everything is within the framework of the law .  the bengali problem was a long standing one which has become an unfinished job,  he said, using a term used by many in myanmar to refer to the rohingya that suggests they come from bangladesh.  many aid programmes running in northern rakhine prior to the outbreak of violence, including life saving food assistance by the world food programme (wfp), have been suspended since the fighting broke out.  food security indicators and child malnutrition rates in maungdaw were already above emergency thresholds before the violence broke out, and it is likely that they will now deteriorate even further,  said pierre peron, spokesman for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in myanmar. more than 80,000 children may need treatment for malnutrition in northern rakhine and many of them reported  extreme  food insecurity, wfp said in july. in bangladesh, tan of unhcr said more shelters and medical care were needed.  there s a lot of pregnant women and lactating mothers and really young children, some of them born during the flight. they all need medical attention,  she said. among new arrivals, 22 year old tahara begum gave birth to her second child in a forest on the way to bangladesh.   it was the hardest thing i ve ever done,  she said.

" americans are increasingly confident in the news media and less so in president donald trump’s administration after a tumultuous year in u.s. politics that tested the public’s trust in both institutions, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on tuesday.  the poll of more than 14,300 people found that the percentage of adults who said they had a “great deal” or “some” confidence in the press rose to 48 percent in september from 39 percent last november. earlier this year, trump branded the entire industry as the “enemy of the american people.”  the percentage of those who said they had “hardly any” confidence in the press dropped to 45 percent from 51 percent over the same period.  confidence in trump’s administration moved in the opposite direction.  reuters/ipsos, which tracked confidence in major institutions every couple of months after the 2016 presidential election, found in late january that 52 percent of americans had a “great deal” or “some” confidence in the new president’s executive branch. that dropped to 51 percent in the may survey and to 48 percent in the latest poll. trump took office in january.  in comparison, 57 percent of americans expressed similar levels of confidence in former democratic president barack obama’s outgoing administration in november.  the poll also found that the shift in trust was not simply a partisan reaction to a republican president.  from january to september, the percentage of people who had a “great deal” or “some” confidence in the executive branch dropped 6 percentage points among republicans and 3 points among democrats.  the percentage of those who expressed similar levels of confidence in the media rose 3 points this year among republicans and 11 points among democrats.  more than other modern presidents, trump has treated the news media as an opposition party. he has shamed individual reporters by name and responded to unflattering reports as “fake news.”  every president clashes with the news media, but trump “has gone a step further in attacking the press and questioning their legitimacy,” said martha kumar, a presidential historian who has worked with white house transition teams for obama and 2008 republican presidential nominee senator john mccain.  “what you’re seeing now is a gradual recognition of the importance of the press” at a time when people are still getting used to a new president whose campaign is under federal investigation for alleged collusion with russia, kumar said. trump has denied any collusion occurred.  kumar added that confidence in the press may be rising this year because news organizations have offered wildly different perspectives on trump, satisfying people who like him as well as those who do not.  “they’re not all watching and reading the same things,” she said. “they’re gravitating toward organizations they trust.”  ari fleischer, former republican president george w. bush’s first press secretary, said any shift in the way people viewed the press and the president was likely the product of an oppositional relationship that both sides had pushed since the 2016 presidential campaign.  “trump throws fastballs directly at the press’ head. he does it almost every day,” fleischer said.  “this makes those who oppose trump draw into the press,” elevating its stature among those who would otherwise not trust the media, he said.  “but the press has played into it by the mistakes they’ve made, by missing the rise of trump, by being too liberal,” fleischer added. “they’ve helped create this environment.”  the public placed its highest levels of confidence in the military, law enforcement and academia, according to the latest poll that ended on sept. 5. americans lost confidence this year in the executive branch and in congress, while their confidence rose for most other institutions, including the press and academia.  the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english throughout the united states. it ran three polls this year on confidence in major institutions: between jan. 24 and feb. 7, may 11 to may 21 and from aug. 24 to sept. 5.  it collected a combined 14,328 responses from those polls, and the data has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

" the spokesman for president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort testified before a federal grand jury on friday in special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between trump’s 2016 election campaign and russia. jason maloni, the president of the crisis public relations firm jaderoq llc, spoke briefly with reporters after leaving a courtroom where he had testified for a little less than two hours. “i was ordered to appear today before the grand jury. i answered questions and i’ve been dismissed,” maloni said. he declined to discuss the types of questions he was asked. mueller is investigating manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for the party of regions, a pro russian political party in ukraine, that backed former ukrainian leader viktor yanukovich. overall, mueller’s investigation and two congressional panels are looking into conclusions by u.s. intelligence agencies that russia worked to tilt last november’s election in republican trump’s favor. moscow has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion by his campaign. mueller’s investigators are examining potential money laundering by manafort and other possible financial crimes, sources have told reuters. manafort was also present at a june 2016 meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya who offered to provide damaging information about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. others at that meeting included trump’s eldest son, donald trump, jr., and son in law, jared kushner. in july, manafort’s virginia home was raided by fbi agents. maloni, as manafort’s spokesman, had told reporters that manafort “has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.” ",0
" u.s. lawmakers are expected to pass a large aid package for victims of hurricane harvey, but specifics of the plan and its price tag are unclear as congress awaits a funding request from the trump administration. rain continued to pound houston and the gulf coast on monday as president donald trump said he expected rapid federal action to help fund a costly recovery. he plans to visit texas on tuesday to see storm hit areas. “we’re dealing with congress. as you know it’s going to be a very expensive situation,” he told reporters in the white house. historic flooding from harvey, which came ashore in texas last week as a powerful category 4 hurricane and is now a tropical storm, has killed at least seven people in texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes. wall street analysts estimated insured losses of up to $20 billion, making harvey one of the costliest storms in history for u.s. insurers. after past disasters, congress approved billions of dollars in funds to help with relief and recovery, but in recent years, fiscal conservatives have raised questions about costs. congress will return next week from summer vacation, with the hurricane complicating an already difficult fiscal situation with the federal budget and trump’s mexican border wall proposal. current government funding runs out on sept. 30. congress must approve a measure to keep the government funded and prevent a shutdown. trump threatened last week to shut down the government if congress did not agree to $1.6 billion in funding to start building his proposed wall on the u.s. mexico border. harvey “will increase the pressure on washington to not shut down the government, but it also makes the september 30 package more cumbersome and complicated,” chris krueger, policy analyst at financial firm cowen & co, said in a research note. asked if harvey made him reconsider his shutdown threat, trump said: “it has nothing to do with it, really. i think this is separate. this is going to go really very, very quickly.” congressional republicans have not spelled out their plan for dealing with the budget and a related, must pass increase in the federal debt ceiling. some aides and analysts have speculated that those issues might be swept into a single piece of legislation, possibly including harvey aid.  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on monday that “republicans must be ready to join democrats in passing a timely relief bill.” federal emergency management agency administrator brock long said more than 450,000 people were expected to seek disaster assistance because of catastrophic flooding. “we will help those affected by this terrible disaster. the first step in that process is a formal request for resources from the administration,” said ashlee strong, spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan. a senate republican aide said it was too soon to say what was needed. “the committee is monitoring the situation in texas closely,” said chris gallegos, a spokesman for the republican majority on the senate appropriations committee. there is only about $3.3 billion in the federal disaster relief fund. congress approved $62.3 billion in aid after hurricane katrina devastated gulf coast communities and flooded new orleans in 2005. texas republican representative pete sessions told msnbc he expected lawmakers to back any aid package as long as it was not bloated beyond the needed storm response. some conservatives have balked in the past at authorizing money for disaster relief. in 2005, then indiana republican representative mike pence, now vice president, called on the floor of the house for “offsetting” money spent on katrina relief with cutbacks elsewhere. almost the entire texas delegation   including sessions and republican senator ted cruz   opposed the $50.5 billion aid package that congress approved three months after hurricane sandy hit new jersey and new york in 2012. opponents argued that the sandy package funded things unrelated to the disaster.       “the sandy relief bill had more pork in it than a bacon factory,” said representative blake farenthold, a republican who represents corpus christi, which was hit hard by harvey. republican representative pete king of new york said in a twitter message on monday: “i won’t abandon texas the way ted cruz did new york.” ",0
" transgender recruits will be able to join the u.s. military as of jan. 1 after a federal judge on monday denied a request by president donald trump’s administration to enforce his ban on transgender troops while the government appeals an order blocking it. in a ruling, with which the pentagon said it would comply, u.s. district judge colleen kollar kotelly in washington refused to lift part of her oct. 30 order stopping the ban from taking effect until the case is resolved, saying it likely violated the u.s. constitution’s guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.  the white house said the justice department was reviewing its options. the pentagon said in a statement that it would follow court orders and begin processing transgender applicants on jan. 1. it added, however, that it and the u.s. department of justice “are actively pursuing relief from those court orders in order to allow an ongoing policy review scheduled to be completed before the end of march.”  the administration had argued that the jan. 1 deadline was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. kollar kotelly rejected the concerns, saying preparations for accepting transgender troops were under way during the administration of trump’s predecessor, barack obama.  “the directive from the secretary of defense requiring the military to prepare to begin allowing accession of transgender individuals was issued on june 30, 2016   nearly one and a half years ago,” the judge said.  several transgender service members filed a lawsuit after trump said in july he would ban transgender people from the military, citing concern over military focus and medical costs. in an august memorandum, trump gave the military until march 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. the memo also halted the use of government funds for sex reassignment surgery for active duty personnel.  defense secretary james mattis had previously delayed a deadline that had been set during the obama administration to begin enlisting transgender recruits to jan. 1, which trump’s ban then put off indefinitely.  the pentagon said on monday there were a number of guidelines that would have to be met by the applicants.  it said that sex reassignment or genital reconstruction would be disqualifying factors unless a medical provider certified that a period of 18 months had passed since the most recent surgery, no complications persisted and additional surgeries are not required.  the service members who sued trump, mattis and military leaders in august had been serving openly as transgender people in the u.s. army, air force and coast guard. they said trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.  in her october ruling, kollar kotelly said the trump administration’s reasons for the ban “do not appear to be supported by any facts” and cited a military commissioned study that debunked concerns about military cohesion or healthcare costs.  a federal judge in maryland also halted the ban in nov. 21 ruling.

" u.s. president donald trump on friday ordered reviews of major banking rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with wall street bankers. though the order was short on specifics, financial markets embraced trump’s signal that looser banking regulation is coming and pushed bank stocks higher. the dow jones u.s. banks stocks index closed up 2.6 percent. .djusbk [.n]  at a white house forum on friday with u.s. business leaders, including jpmorgan chase’s (jpm.n) ceo jamie dimon, trump said his administration expects “to be cutting a lot out of dodd frank.” that will involve a lot more than issuing an order, said former democratic congressman barney frank, co author of the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that raised capital requirements for banks, restricted their trading by means of the “volcker rule,” and created the consumer financial protection bureau to guard against predatory lending. trump “can’t make any substantial change in the financial reform bill without congress,” frank told reuters. “the language in the order doesn’t do anything. it tells the secretary of the treasury to give them something to read. the tone of it is to weaken the bill.” trump and other critics of the dodd frank law say its regulations have hindered lending. at the meeting with ceo’s on friday trump said, “i have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses that can’t borrow money...because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in dodd frank.” despite such criticisms, recent data from the federal reserve bank of st. louis showed u.s. commercial bank lending at a 70 year high, climbing steadily since late 2010. democratic senator elizabeth warren who lobbied for the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau accused trump of forsaking middle and lower income individuals to help banks. “the wall street bankers and lobbyists whose greed and recklessness nearly destroyed this country may be toasting each other with champagne, but the american people have not forgotten the 2008 financial crisis   and they will not forget what happened today,” she said in a statement. trump’s adviser leading the deregulation effort, national economic council director gary cohn, was previously a top official at goldman sachs (gs.n). billionaire investor carl icahn, meanwhile, is counseling trump on regulation across the government. one order signed by trump requires the u.s. treasury secretary to submit possible regulatory changes and legislation modifying dodd frank in 120 days, according to a white house official. trump’s pick for treasury secretary, steve mnuchin, also a former goldman banker, has yet to be confirmed by the full senate. meanwhile, a memo tells the labor department to review a “fiduciary rule” for brokers offering retirement advice that was finalized in 2016. while early reports said trump wanted to push off the rule’s implementation, originally slated for april, by 180 days, the order did not mention any delay. the labor department late on friday said it was considering legal options for delaying.  representatives of the six largest u.s. banks – jpmorgan chase & co (jpm.n), bank of america corp (bac.n), citigroup inc (c.n), wells fargo & co (wfc.n), goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) – either declined to comment or did not have an immediate comment. bankers, lawyers and lobbyists privately said trump’s order would not do much immediately. also they said that they would prefer less extensive modifications to dodd frank after spending billions of dollars complying with the law. many want to make it “a little bit more user friendly,” said john kanas, chairman of bankunited (bku.n), a lender with less than $20 billion in assets.  house of representatives financial services committee chairman jeb hensarling, a republican, told reporters at the white house that trump’s approach reflects legislation he has drafted to review dodd frank. hensarling is expected to re introduce his bill allowing banks to choose between complying with dodd frank and holding more capital later this month. trump could also make changes simply by appointing new personnel or not enforcing rules. “a lot of the regulations of dodd frank required a bit of a cop on the beat if you will, to ensure enforcement and if you have a different cop on the beat, they enforce different rules, or they enforce the rules differently,” said fbr & co financial policy analyst edward mills. many regulators, though, were appointed by trump’s predecessor, president barack obama, and intend to complete their terms. trump cannot fire heads of independent agencies, including the three top bank regulators: federal reserve chair janet yellen, comptroller of the currency thomas curry, and federal deposit insurance corp chairman martin gruenberg.  in addition, the term for richard cordray, the consumer financial protection bureau director, stretches into next year. republican lawmakers are pushing trump to fire cordray, but a federal court’s decision allowing him to has been stayed pending appeal.  meanwhile, some u.s. financial policy leaders want to keep the law. chicago fed president charles evans said on friday dodd frank “has largely been helpful” and led to a banking system with “more and better capital.” ",0
" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on wednesday his government s future was at risk if it lost a sydney by election this weekend and failed to regain its one seat majority, forcing it to rely on independents to survive in power. turnbull s conservative voter base in the harbourside seat of bennelong, usually a safe blue ribbon seat, has collapsed, according to an opinion poll on tuesday. the newspoll in the australian newspaper said turnbull s liberal national coalition and the opposition labor each have a 50 percent chance of winning on a two party preferred vote, with liberal voters deserting to a newly formed conservative party.  it is a tight race. it is very high cost. if labor were to win in bennelong, then (labor leader) bill shorten would be very close to becoming prime minister,  turnbull told reporters in sydney. if turnbull loses bennelong, it would only take the loss of support from key independents in a vote of no confidence to see his minority government topple. centre left labor has not held power since 2013. turnbull has led a minority government since october after his deputy prime minister was forced to quit parliament for holding dual citizenship. under australia s constitution, national politicians can only have australian citizenship. the deputy prime minister was re elected on dec. 2 after renouncing his new zealand citizenship, but turnbull failed to regain his one seat majority because bennelong s liberal incumbent, former tennis champion john alexander, quit parliament because he believed he might hold dual australian british citizenship. turnbull s future now rests on the voters of the affluent bennelong electorate, where 13 percent of electors were born in either china or hong kong. but a strain in relations between australia and china in the past week may cost turnbull votes. turnbull announced last week a ban on foreign political donations aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics. he singled out china in announcing the ban, prompting a rebuke in china s people s daily newspaper.  australia must recognise china is now leading the world. the government s attitude towards china will cost them votes, said cao gui dong, a candidate for the christian democrat party in bennelong. a loss in bennelong would also see turnbull s grip on the prime ministership again come under scrutiny, with one liberal politician already calling for him to quit before christmas. turnbull has fought off leadership speculation for most of 2017, amid a slump in polls as voters flock to far right parties, but has vowed to lead his government to the next election due in 2019.

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri said on saturday that he would not accept iran backed hezbollah s positions that  affect our arab brothers or target the security and stability of their countries , a statement from his press office said. the statement did not specify which countries he meant. hariri announced his resignation from his post on nov. 4 in a televised statement from saudi arabia, a sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with shi ite iran. hezbollah is fighting alongside syrian president bashar al assad in syria. gulf monarchies have accused the shi ite group of also supporting the houthi group in yemen and of backing militants in bahrain. hezbollah denies any activity in yemen or bahrain. hariri s resignation pitched lebanon to the forefront of a regional power tussle this month between saudi arabia and iran, which backs hezbollah. the two regional powers back competing factions in iraq, syria, lebanon and yemen. after returning to lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on wednesday at the request of president michel aoun, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the middle east. following his announcement, made on lebanon s independence day, hundreds of hariri supporters packed the streets near his house in central beirut, waving the blue flag of his future movement political party. on saturday, he said that his decision to wait instead of officially resigning is to give a chance to discuss and look into demands that will make lebanon neutral and allow it to enforce its  disassociation  policy.  disassociation  is widely understood in lebanon to mean its policy of staying out of regional conflicts. the regional role played by the hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed saudi arabia, hariri s long time ally. on saturday, hezbollah s international relations officer ammar moussawi said that the shi ite group is ready to reach understandings with  our partners in the country , and that the group is open to real dialogue and cooperation with all, lebanon s state news agency nna reported. moussawi added that hariri s resignation, which he said was done under coercion from riyadh, was a spark that aimed to ignite lebanon. top lebanese druze politician walid jumblatt on saturday called on saudi arabia to enter dialogue with iran and said that the kingdom s modernization plans could not work while riyadh was engaged in a war in yemen.

" the overseers of the u.s. intelligence community have not embraced a cia assessment that russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping republican president elect donald trump win the 2016 election, three american officials said on monday. while the office of the director of national intelligence (odni) does not dispute the cia’s analysis of russian hacking operations, it has not endorsed their assessment because of a lack of conclusive evidence that moscow intended to boost trump over democratic opponent hillary clinton, said the officials, who declined to be named. the position of the odni, which oversees the 17 agency strong u.s. intelligence community, could give trump fresh ammunition to dispute the cia assessment, which he rejected as “ridiculous” in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates russia in the cyber attacks. trump’s rejection of the cia’s judgment marks the latest in a string of disputes over russia’s international conduct that have erupted between the president elect and the intelligence community he will soon command. an odni spokesman declined to comment on the issue. “odni is not arguing that the agency (cia) is wrong, only that they can’t prove intent,” said one of the three u.s. officials. “of course they can’t, absent agents in on the decision making in moscow.” the federal bureau of investigation, whose evidentiary standards require it to make cases that can stand up in court, declined to accept the cia’s analysis   a deductive assessment of the available intelligence   for the same reason, the three officials said. the odni, headed by james clapper, was established after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the recommendation of the commission that investigated the attacks. the commission, which identified major intelligence failures, recommended the office’s creation to improve coordination among u.s. intelligence agencies. in october, the u.s. government formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against american political organizations ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. democratic president barack obama has said he warned russian president vladimir putin about consequences for the attacks. reports of the assessment by the cia, which has not publicly disclosed its findings, have prompted congressional leaders to call for an investigation. obama last week ordered intelligence agencies to review the cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the presidential election and to deliver a report before he turns power over to trump on jan. 20. the cia assessed after the election that the attacks on political organizations were aimed at swaying the vote for trump because the targeting of republican organizations diminished toward the end of the summer and focused on democratic groups, a senior u.s. official told reuters on friday. moreover, only materials filched from democratic groups   such as emails stolen from john podesta, the clinton campaign chairman   were made public via wikileaks, the anti secrecy organization, and other outlets, u.s. officials said. the cia conclusion was a “judgment based on the fact that russian entities hacked both democrats and republicans and only the democratic information was leaked,” one of the three officials said on monday. “(it was) a thin reed upon which to base an analytical judgment,” the official added. republican senator john mccain said on monday there was “no information” that russian hacking of american political organizations was aimed at swaying the outcome of the election. “it’s obvious that the russians hacked into our campaigns,” mccain said. “but there is no information that they were intending to affect the outcome of our election and that’s why we need a congressional investigation,” he told reuters. mccain questioned an assertion made on sunday by republican national committee chairman reince priebus, tapped by trump to be his white house chief of staff, that there were no hacks of computers belonging to republican organizations. “actually, because mr. priebus said that doesn’t mean it’s true,” said mccain. “we need a thorough investigation of it, whether both (democratic and republican organizations) were hacked into, what the russian intentions were. we cannot draw a conclusion yet. that’s why we need a thorough investigation.” in an angry letter sent to odni chief clapper on monday, house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes said he was “dismayed” that the top u.s. intelligence official had not informed the panel of the cia’s analysis and the difference between its judgment and the fbi’s assessment. noting that clapper in november testified that intelligence agencies lacked strong evidence linking russian cyber attacks to the wikileaks disclosures, nunes asked that clapper, together with cia and fbi counterparts, brief the panel by friday on the latest intelligence assessment of russian hacking during the election campaign.

" china s air force has carried out exercises near the korean peninsula, practicing to defend against a  surprise attack  coming over the sea, chinese state media said. the exercises came days after north korea s sixth, and most powerful, nuclear test fueled global concern that the isolated nation plans more weapons tests, possibly of a long range missile. an anti aircraft defense battalion held the exercises early on tuesday, near the bohai sea, the innermost gulf of the yellow sea that separates china from the korean peninsula, an official military website said. troops traveled to the site from central china before immediately beginning drills to fend off the  surprise attack  simulating real battle, it said.  the troops  rapid response capabilities and actual combat levels have effectively been tested. it was the first time certain weapons, which the website did not identify, had been used to shoot down low altitude targets coming over the sea, www.81.cn said, without elaborating. the drills  do not target any particular goal or country , and were part of an annual plan intended to boost the troops  capability, china s defence ministry said on its website late on wednesday, in a response to media.   after weeks of rising tension over north korea s actions, south korea and the united states have been discussing the deployment of aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the korean peninsula. china is deeply suspicious of any u.s. backed military build up in the region, and has repeatedly expressed anger at the deployment of a u.s. anti missile defense system in south korea.

" a general appointed at the weekend to run venezuela s energy sector will name more military officers to senior management posts at state oil company pdvsa as part of a shakeup the government says is aimed at fighting corruption, two company sources told reuters on monday.  in a surprise move, unpopular leftist president nicolas maduro on sunday tapped major general manuel quevedo to lead pdvsa [pdvsa.ul] and the oil ministry, giving the already powerful military control of the opec nation s dominant industry.  besides the corruption scandals, quevedo will have to tackle an attempted debt restructuring, within the context of a deep recession and debilitating u.s. sanctions. sources in the sector said quevedo s appointment could quicken a white collar exodus from pdvsa and worsen operational problems at a time when production has already tumbled to near 30 year lows of under 2 million barrels per day. about 50 officials at state oil company pdvsa have been arrested since august in what the state prosecutor says is a  crusade  against corruption. sources within pdvsa and the oil industry said maduro s administration was using corruption allegations to sideline rivals and deepen its control of the industry, which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue.       the order given is to militarize pdvsa in key areas,  said a pdvsa employee, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  a second source said he was told military officials would take over key production divisions in venezuela s east and west. venezuela s president, a former bus driver and union leader whose popularity has plummeted during the economic crisis, has gradually handed the military more power in his cabinet and in key sectors such as mining. unlike his popular predecessor hugo chavez, maduro does not hail from the military. the opposition says he has been forced to buy the loyalty of the army, historically a power broker in venezuela, giving them top posts and juicy business contracts while turning a blind eye to corruption.  pdvsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an internal company message seen by reuters called on workers to come to caracas on tuesday for quevedo s swearing in.  let s all go to caracas to consolidate the deepening of socialism and the total, absolute transformation of pdvsa,  the message read.  quevedo, a former housing minister with no known energy experience, is not a heavyweight in venezuela s political scene, although two sources close to the military told reuters he was a maduro ally.  opposition lawmaker angel alvarado predicted the appointment would worsen pdvsa s operations.   they re getting rid of the old executives, who although socialist and working under catastrophic management, at least knew about oil,  he said.  now we re going to have totally inexperienced hands.    although military appointees had been on the rise within the oil industry too, quevedo s appointment is the first time in a decade and a half that a military official has taken the helm of the oil industry.  pdvsa so far had been led by chemist nelson martinez and the oil ministry by engineer eulogio del pino, both of whom rose in the ranks under previous pdvsa president and oil minister rafael ramirez.  later demoted to become venezuela s representative at the united nations in new york, ramirez recently criticized maduro for not reforming venezuela s flailing economy, in what insiders say is a power struggle between the two rivals.  the opposition has also accused quevedo of violating human rights during the national guard s handling of anti maduro protests, in which stone throwing hooded youths regularly clashed with tear gas firing soldiers.  u.s. senator marco rubio included quevedo on a 2014 list of venezuelan officials whom he said should be named in u.s. sanctions, although quevedo does not appear in the list released by the u.s. treasury department. venezuela s government denies abuses, saying protesters were in fact part of a u.s. promoted  armed insurrection  designed to sabotage socialism in latin america.  quevedo s appointment has worried foreign oil companies in venezuela, including u.s. major chevron and russian state oil giant rosneft, according to industry sources. venezuela is also trying to pull off a complex restructuring of foreign debt, including $60 billion in bonds, about half of which have been issued by pdvsa. bondholders were invited to caracas for a meeting with the government two weeks ago, but market sources say there has been no concrete progress or proposals since.  pdvsa said on friday it was making last minute payments on two bonds close to default, including one backed by shares in u.s. based citgo, a venezuelan owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products, due on monday, and called for  trust  as it seeks to maintain debt service amid the crisis. quevedo s position on the debt issue is not publicly known.

" frauke petry, the former co leader of the far right alternative for germany (afd), will unveil her new  blue party  on friday, promising a  reasonable conservative  agenda that would appeal to a broad base of germans, she told a newspaper group. petry, a 42 year old chemist, was for a time the most visible face of the afd, helping to build the public appeal that saw it win 12.6 percent of the vote last month and become the first far right group in the german parliament since the 1960s. but although she has long espoused strong anti immigrant views, she berated other leading figures in the afd for holding positions too far outside the mainstream and making it impossible for the party to join a coalition government. during the months leading up to the election she took a lower profile role in campaigning, all but vanishing from tv screens as more radical figures became the party s public faces. she won a seat in parliament on the afd s list last month, but quit the party the next day in a surprise announcement at its victory press conference, pledging to sit in parliament initially as an independent. she told rnd newspaper group in an interview published late on thursday that she would hold a small initial event to announce her new blue party on friday in her home state of saxony in the former communist east. more rallies would follow around the country from november under the banner of  blue change  or  blaue wende , she said. wende is the term widely used to describe the dramatic shift in german society after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989.  blue stands for conservative, but also liberal policies in germany and in europe,  she told rnd, adding that her new group would seek to replicate the success of the christian social union (csu), the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives, on a national level. the csu, part of merkel s conservative bloc in parliament, has taken a harder line than merkel s own christian democratic union over immigration, but fields candidates only in bavaria, a state that accounts for 15 percent of germany s population.   every third german would like a reasonable, conservative political offering,  she said, adding that many frustrated voters had supported the pro business free democrats, the afd or  merkel s cdu on sept. 24 for lack of a better alternative. petry said she had begun working on plans for her new party as early as august, after afd members refused to accept her more moderate proposals at a party congress in cologne. rnd said german election authorities listed the new party as having been founded on sept. 17, a week before the vote. petry defended her decision to quit the afd while keeping her seat won on its list, saying she would remain loyal to her voters.  the mandate doesn t belong to the party, even if it was won with party funds,  she said. the afd is ostracized by all other parties, which refuse to work with it. none even wants to sit next to the afd in parliament.

" the kremlin said on friday that a u.s. decision to close russia’s san francisco consulate and buildings in washington and new york pushed bilateral ties further into a blind alley and fueled a spiral of tit for tat retaliatory measures. the united states on thursday ordered russia to close the facilities by sept. 2 in retaliation for moscow cutting the u.s. diplomatic presence in russia. “the new steps push our bilateral relations even further into a dead end and contradict other high level announcements ,” kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov told a news briefing when asked about the closures. “there have been words, but there’s no readiness to cooperate yet. this is about further escalating tensions. we regret this and will calmly think about how we might respond.” russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said earlier on friday that moscow would respond harshly to u.s. measures it deemed damaging. moscow last month ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of russian diplomats in the united states, after congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against russia.

" brazil s government has secured between 270 and 280 of the 308 votes needed to approve a bill to overhaul the country s bloated social security system in february, president michel temer said on friday.  it was the first time temer has said how many votes are still needed to reach the three fifths super majority to pass the unpopular legislation that investors see as vital to bringing a huge budget deficit under control.  that is the reason why we put off the vote until february,  temer said at the swearing in of a cabinet minister who will be responsible for mustering the votes shortfall. the measure is due to be put to the vote on feb. 19, after the christmas to carnival congressional recess, when it could meet with greater reluctance from lawmakers as the 2018 general election approaches.  the delay has increased market skepticism over brazil s ability to rein in a deficit that caused the loss of its investment grade credit rating.    temer s new minister of political affairs, carlos marun, said the bill s approval will be his biggest challenge as he takes over government relations with congress. marun was sworn in to succeed antonio imbassahy, whose psdb party quit temer s governing coalition and is split over delivering its 46 votes in the lower house to help pass temer s pension plan.

" donald trump’s endorsement from new jersey governor chris christie opens up a wide network of donors, advisers and prominent elected officials whom the billionaire has not yet been able to attract to his unorthodox bid for the republican presidential nomination. as trump tries to lock up the republican nomination on super tuesday, christie advisers and supporters told reuters in interviews that he could bring much needed financial and strategic backing.  christie’s backing demonstrates that trump will be able to bring establishment politicians into the fold, that he could raise the money necessary for a general election campaign and build a staffing operation that can rival a democratic nominee.      the nod from christie comes at a critical moment. on tuesday, 11 states will vote and if trump is able to win all or most of them, he could pull so far ahead in the competition for delegates that none of his rivals will be able to catch him. in an interview with reuters, christie supporter finn wentworth, a real estate investor and former head of the company that owns the new york yankees, new jersey nets and new jersey devils, said he is now seriously considering backing trump. “i am a long time supporter of governor christie. in that process, i have learned to respect his opinion and his judgment,” wentworth said. “he’s a results oriented person, and frankly i am now looking at donald trump because of governor christie’s endorsement today.” maine governor paul lepage, who had backed christie initially, quickly followed in the new jersey governor’s footsteps and got behind trump   making him the second sitting governor to endorse the new york real estate mogul. maine votes on march 5.  a senior christie aide told reuters he believes staff could move to the trump campaign in the coming weeks, helping the republican front runner in his fledgling efforts to build a circle of advisers who could form the core of his general election campaign should he clinch the nomination. wentworth said part of his decision making process is that he is now convinced it is inevitable that trump will clinch the republican nomination. dale florio, a donor to christie, said he, along with others, has a call scheduled with the new jersey governor later on friday. “if he says, i’d like you guys to support donald trump, i’ll be there for him,” florio said. trump has thus far avoided traditional fundraising. however, more than half of his campaign spending in 2015 was covered by money raised through the sale of his “make america great again” hats and t shirts, even though he told his supporters not to write donation checks. but as a nominee, that position may be impossible to stick to, especially if clinton is the democratic nominee and she is able to build a sizable arsenal. christie’s endorsement could have the power to bring more establishment aligned officials and donors into trump’s camp. christie could also serve as a surrogate fundraiser. christie is no stranger to the nation’s top republican donors. in 2014, he served as the head of the republican governors association, a role that largely consists of traveling the nation and raising money for republican gubernatorial candidates. christie was one of the most successful heads the organization has ever seen. rob gray, a republican strategist who had been advising jeb bush, the former florida governor who dropped out of the race last saturday, called the endorsement a “stunning surprise.”  “christie’s endorsement is an indicator to me trump is starting to mainstream his candidacy and that he’ll be able to attract a lot of mainstream experienced political leaders’ support if he gets the nomination,” gray said. “i wasn’t as sure before this.” the biggest boost christie may have offered trump was a distraction from the coverage of marco rubio’s thursday night debate performance and increased scrutiny in some of his business endeavors, like trump university, a defunct venture that offered real estate investing seminars and which is currently the target of lawsuits. both rubio and ted cruz, trump’s two biggest challengers, battered away at trump in thursday’s televised debate   the last before super tuesday. “i’m sure rubio and cruz at the very least had things that they wanted to do today to follow up from their narrative last night and this kind of sucked the air out,” said tom rath, who is advising the campaign of ohio governor john kasich.

" chastened by their worst result since 1949 in september s national election, chancellor angela merkel s conservatives are hoping for victory in a regional vote on sunday to strengthen their hand in thorny three way coalition talks in berlin. while victory in the lower saxony region might strengthen merkel s position within her party, a conservative failure to emerge as the strongest party could prompt talk of weakening authority and possible eventual succession, said berlin based political expert gero neugebauer. lower saxony, an agricultural heartland and germany s second biggest region, offers merkel s christian democrats (cdu) the prospect of a morale boost as they seek to cobble together an unprecedented  jamaica  national coalition with the liberal free democrats (fdp) and greens. the road to such an alliance, named after the caribbean nation as the parties  colors match those of its flag, is littered with disputes on everything from migrants to tax and the environment. it would be the clunky coalition s federal debut if talks, due to start next week, prove a success. carsten nickel, deputy research director at teneo intelligence, said sunday s election   which polls show is set to be a neck and neck contest between the cdu and the rival social democrats (spd)   would determine momentum going into national coalition negotiations. the election in the northern state, home to carmaker volkswagen (vowg_p.de), was called after a lawmaker in the greens party   junior coalition partner to the spd there   defected to the cdu, robbing the ruling alliance of its one seat majority.  if merkel managed to steal that state from the spd, it would probably be a little bit of a boost,  he said.  it would probably be slightly easier for her to argue internally for the required compromise and for striking the deals and so on that will be required over the next couple of weeks.   however, a new poll for broadcaster zdp released late on thursday showed the spd with 34.5 percent, closely followed by the cdu with 33 percent. the greens and fdp both had 9 percent while the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) was on track to get 7 percent and move into lower saxony s state assembly for the first time. the left party got 5 percent. about 29 percent of voters were still undecided about which party to support or whether to vote at all, it showed. the cdu has dropped far below the 12 point lead it had over the spd in august at the start of a campaign that has centered on regional issues such as education, as well as an influx of migrants to germany over the last two years. the latest poll means the spd and greens would not have enough support to govern again, even if they joined forces with the left party. that leaves a coalition of the spd and conservatives, a coalition of the spd, greens and fdp, or the jamaica coalition being pursued on a national level. merkel s cdu and their bavarian sister party (csu) removed a major stumbling block to those coalition talks on sunday by ending a dispute over migrant policy with an agreement to limit the number of migrants coming to germany. merkel s conservative bloc won 33 percent in september s national election, losing 8.5 points compared with 2013, as voters upset with merkel s 2015 decision to open the borders to more than a million migrants abandoned the party. the result effectively brought an end to the existing national coalition with the spd, who also performed badly.

" kenya s government denied a request by supreme court judges for extra security after one of their bodyguards was shot, preventing them from holding a hearing that could have delayed last week s presidential election, a senior judicial source said on tuesday. the court has been center stage since it annulled an aug. 8 vote won by president uhuru kenyatta, citing procedural irregularities and ordering a repeat vote within 60 days. the decision was the first of its kind in africa, where governments often hold sway over judges. it angered some of kenyatta s supporters, who said the judges had thwarted the will of the people. kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in the oct. 26 re run after opposition leader raila odinga boycotted it on the grounds it would not be fair because the election board had failed to implement reforms he sought after the court decision. the supreme court had been due to meet on oct. 25 to deliberate on an eleventh hour request to delay the re run. but the day before, the bodyguard of its deputy chief justice was shot as he bought pot plants beside a highway. only chief justice david maraga turned up for the oct. 25 hearing. without a minimum quorum of five judges, maraga said the court could not make a ruling on the petition, paving the way for the election re run to go ahead. asked about the request by the judges, interior ministry spokesman mwenda njoka said security for all judges was enhanced in the wake of the shooting.  if anybody is telling you to the contrary, they are not telling the truth,  he told reuters. the government said the bodyguard s shooting was a robbery rather than an attempt to intimidate the judges, whom kenyatta had branded as  crooks  after they voided the august election. treating the shooting as a regular crime angered the judges, who demanded they get extra security, the judicial source said.  in kenya, ordinary criminals don t attack government vehicles driven by armed government agents who know how to shoot,  the source said. the justices demanded that their security should be publicly guaranteed given the tensions over the election or else they would refuse to attend hearings, the source said. at least 55 people have died in political violence since the august vote. the european union monitoring mission raised the issue of intimidation after the supreme court hearing failed to go ahead on oct. 25, saying it was vital that judges be allowed to work  in freedom and safety .  the lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a supreme court hearing and has raised serious questions among kenyan stakeholders, including about possible political interference,  it said in a statement that day.

" u.s. president donald trump held out the possibility on sunday of using trade as a lever to secure chinese cooperation against north korea and suggested washington might deal with pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs on its own if need be. the comments, in an interview published on sunday by the financial times, appeared designed to pressure chinese president xi jinping ahead of his visit to trump’s mar a lago resort in florida this week. “china has great influence over north korea. and china will either decide to help us with north korea, or they won’t. and if they do that will be very good for china, and if they don’t it won’t be good for anyone,” trump was quoted as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the newspaper. asked what incentive the united states had to offer china, trump replied: “trade is the incentive. it is all about trade.” asked if he would consider a “grand bargain” in which china pressured pyongyang in return for a guarantee the united states would later remove troops from the korean peninsula, the newspaper quoted trump as saying: “well if china is not going to solve north korea, we will. that is all i am telling you.” it is not clear whether trump’s comments will move china, which has taken steps to increase economic pressure on pyongyang but has long been unwilling to do anything that may destabilize the north and send millions of refugees across their border. it is also unclear what the united states might do on its own to deflect north korea from the expansion of its nuclear capabilities and from the development of missiles with ever longer ranges and the capacity to deliver atomic warheads. trump’s national security aides have completed a review of u.s. options to try to curb north korea’s nuclear and missile programs that includes economic and military measures but leans more toward sanctions and increased pressure on beijing to rein in its reclusive neighbor, a u.s. official said. although the option of pre emptive military strikes on north korea is not off the table, the review prioritizes less risky steps and “de emphasizes direct military action,” the official added, saying it was not immediately known if the national security council recommendations had made their way to trump. the white house declined comment on the recommendations. trump and xi are also expected to discuss chinese ambitions in the south china sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes every year, when they meet on thursday and friday. china claims most of the resource rich south china sea, while brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway. secretary of state rex tillerson spoke on sunday with china’s top diplomat, state councilor yang jiechi, about xi’s visit “and other issues of bilateral and regional importance,” a state department official said on condition of anonymity. china’s foreign ministry said in a statement on monday about the call that yang had described the meeting between xi and trump as being of “great significance” for peace, stability and prosperity in the asia pacific region and the world at large. tillerson told yang that the united states would do its utmost to ensure that the meeting had “positive results,” the ministry said. trump’s deputy national security adviser, k.t. mcfarland, said there was a “real possibility” north korea could be capable of hitting the united states with a nuclear armed missile by the end of trump’s four year term, the financial times reported. mcfarland’s estimate appeared more pessimistic than those of many experts. “the typical estimates are that it will take five years or so,” said siegfried hecker, a former director of the los alamos national laboratory in the united states and a leading expert on north korea’s nuclear program. such estimates are notoriously hard to make both because of the scarcity of intelligence about north korea and uncertainty about how high a success rate pyongyang might want for such missiles. john schilling, a contributor to the “38 north” north korea monitoring project, said pyongyang might have missiles capable of limited strikes on the u.s. mainland by the end of trump’s term, but “it will most likely be a bit later than that.” “i doubt that any missile they could put into service by the end of 2020 will be very reliable, but perhaps it doesn’t have to be   one or two successes out of six launches against the u.s. would be a political game changer to say the least,” schilling said.

" the u.s. house of representatives would override any presidential veto of a bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the sept. 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia, speaker paul ryan predicted on wednesday while also citing concerns with the legislation. “i worry about legal matters. i worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. and i do worry about the precedence. at the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court,” ryan, a republican, told reporters. congress has overwhelmingly passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act in reaction to long running suspicions, denied by saudi arabia, that hijackers of the four u.s. jetliners that attacked the united states in 2001  were backed by the saudi government.  obama in coming days is expected to veto the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue u.s. diplomats, service members or companies. but congress could have the last word if the senate and house of representatives each override that veto by a two thirds vote. “i do think the votes are there for the override,” ryan said. when asked by a reporter if u.s. support for saudi arabia was “unconditional,” ryan responded that the country “is a very important and valuable ally” and is helping washington in the “war on terror.” he noted, however, “our support for any country is not unconditional.” ",0
" as a candidate, u.s. president donald trump promised to close the “carried interest” tax break that benefits some of wall street’s wealthiest financiers   but the republican tax bill released on thursday makes no mention of it. carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits   typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors   that is paid out to the general partners of private equity, venture capital, real estate and hedge funds. under current law, carried interest income is taxed at the capital gains rate of 20 percent. that is well below the 39.6 percent rate that high earners pay on ordinary wages and salary.  trump pledged during his populist presidential campaign to close the carried interest loophole, saying hedge fund managers were “paper pushers” who were “getting away with murder.” carried interest represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. for years they have employed washington lobbyists to help defend the lucrative tax break. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in august that the trump administration still planned to close the loophole for hedge funds, but there might be an exemption to allow financial firms that “create jobs” to continue taking advantage of the tax break. the 429 page tax bill released by republicans in the house of representatives on thursday has no language changing how financial firms can take advantage of the lower carried interest rate. “the introduced text does not modify current policy related to carried interest,” a spokesman for the tax writing house ways and means committee said. the bill is expected to undergo revisions before it is brought up for a vote in the house. trump has said he would like to see the house and the senate pass tax legislation before the u.s. thanksgiving holiday on nov. 23. “we fully expected months ago that the one thing that they would do to close loopholes would be the one thing that trump talked about during the campaign,” said seth hanlon, a senior fellow at the liberal center for american progress and a former economic adviser to democratic president barack obama. obama targeted the carried interest loophole but never closed it. government estimates show it will cost the federal budget at least $20 billion over the next decade.

" u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he was considering packaging a $1 trillion infrastructure plan with either healthcare or tax reform legislation as an incentive to get support from lawmakers, especially democrats. trump also said in an interview with the new york times he may move up the unveiling of a plan to rebuild the country’s deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels, which had been expected later this year. “i’m thinking about accelerating it. i’m thinking about putting it with another bill. could be health care, could be something else. could be tax reform,” trump said. trump was stung by his first legislative push, a failed attempt to roll back former president barack obama’s healthcare law, which ended in an embarrassing collapse in congress two weeks ago. the white house has tried to revive healthcare talks while also seeking other legislative measures   such as tax reform   that could give trump a win in the early part of his presidency. u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao said last week the trump administration would later this year unveil a $1 trillion, 10 year plan to modernize u.s. roads, bridges, airports, electrical grid and water systems, offering incentives for public private partnerships. trump said he wanted to accelerate that roll out, but provided no timeline. trump said democratic lawmakers “are desperate for infrastructure” and may be more likely to sign on to a republican backed tax reform or healthcare bill if spending on roads and bridges were included. “we’re talking about a trillion dollar infrastructure,” trump said. some of the infrastructure projects may be built through public private partnerships, trump said, declining to say how the total spending would split between public and private sources. but he also said that with interest rates low, the government may be better off financing the projects itself. “when you can borrow so inexpensively, you don’t have to do the public private thing. because public private can be very expensive,” trump said. trump said he would make an announcement in two weeks about whether he would seek changes to a wage law for federal projects blamed by conservative groups for inflating costs, though he declined to say what the announcement would be.  conservative groups have pressured the white house on the law, known as the davis bacon act, which requires contractors on federal projects to pay local prevailing wages   a measure backed by labor unions and democrats. on tax reform, trump said he wanted to wait and see what happens on healthcare legislation, which has stalled in the house of representatives, before setting out details on taxes. the details of the healthcare bill could determine how much he could cut taxes, he said. republicans have been working on a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for u.s. based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors   as well as simplify and cut personal income taxes.

" an already contentious move by republican president donald trump to block opposition democratic lawmakers from getting information about his administration received its most scathing criticism yet on friday   from one of the most powerful republican members of the u.s. senate. judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley of iowa, in a more than 2,100 word letter to the white house, asked trump to rescind unprecedented guidance that told executive agencies they do not have to honor requests for information from lawmakers in the minority party, currently the democrats. this week in hearings all over capitol hill members of both parties have criticized the information block. democrats have posited that the trump administration is trying to hide mistakes, problems or wrongdoing from them. grassley, who has served in the senate since 1981, called the guidance “nonsense” and described it as “a bureaucratic effort by the office of legal counsel to insulate the executive branch from scrutiny by the elected representatives of the american people.”  the judiciary committee has jurisdiction over the justice department and its office of legal counsel, which published the guidance last month. grassley said it goes against the u.s. constitution by misrepresenting how congress functions and trying to tell the legislative branch how to do its job. it also impedes democratic lawmakers’ ability to check up on the president, a responsibility also laid out in the constitution, grassley wrote in a letter replete with footnotes and case citations. “i know from experience that a partisan response to oversight only discourages bipartisanship, decreases transparency, and diminishes the crucial role of the american people’s elected representatives,” he wrote. “oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability.”  the justice department declined to comment on grassley’s letter or the guidance. the white house did not return a request for comment. the office of legal counsel has not explained the impetus for publishing the opinion. the guidance did not single out democrats by name. instead, it addressed information requests to executive agencies from the highest ranking lawmaker from the minority party sitting on congressional committees, called ranking members. the republicans hold the majority in both the senate and u.s. house of representatives and therefore chair all the committees, with democrats as ranking members.  the opinion said that agencies only have to respond to  information requests from committee chairs. ranking member requests “do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings,” it said.

" nancy pelosi may face a challenge to her 14 year old role as the leading democrat in the u.s. house of representatives now that republicans have captured the white house and maintained their grip on congress. representative tim ryan, 43, of ohio, is weighing a run against pelosi, 76, who is the house minority leader and former speaker of the house, said ryan’s spokesman michael zetts. the party vote for minority leader is scheduled for thursday. “he is concerned that if changes aren’t made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come,” zetts said. it was unclear how much support ryan might have. he has been in the house since 2003. voters who elected republican donald trump over democrat hillary clinton on nov. 8 also gave democrats a few more seats in the 435 member u.s. house of representatives and the 100 member senate, but republicans held on to their majorities in both. democrats had expected to do much better; some had predicted double digit wins in the house. pelosi, of california, faced calls from representative seth moulton and other democrats, dismayed by the election results, to postpone the party’s leadership election until later in november while a reassessment is made. house majority leader kevin mccarthy, a republican, may have given some ammunition to pelosi’s detractors on monday when he said, “i kind of like pelosi staying around. as long as she’s there, i think we stay in the majority.” the new congress convenes on jan. 3; trump will succeed president barack obama, a democrat, on jan. 20. in the u.s. senate, new york’s chuck schumer is expected to replace the retiring fellow democrat harry reid as minority leader. in the republican party, no one is challenging senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and house republicans are expected on tuesday to nominate paul ryan to remain house speaker.  ryan would face an election in january, when all members of the new house, both democrats and republicans, vote on a new speaker.  before trump’s win, some republican conservatives angered by ryan’s tepid support for trump were talking about trying to block his re election. those threats have subsided but not vanished. an aide to new york republican representative chris collins said, “congressman collins fully believes speaker ryan is a slam dunk to be re elected as speaker, and looks forward to working with him in the next congress.” collins was trump’s first supporter in the house. some conservative republicans still have doubts. “presently speaker ryan does not have my vote, but i will listen to his message tomorrow,” representative tom massie of kentucky said in a statement.

" guatemala s federal auditor on tuesday said it will investigate a salary bonus the defense ministry gives to president jimmy morales that raises his earnings by more than a third, making him one of the best paid leaders in latin america.  the federal comptroller, which audits all government spending, said in a statement it had asked for information on the previously unknown 50,000 quetzals ($7,300)  bonus for extraordinary responsibility  that is not officially part of the president s salary package. defense minister william mansilla on tuesday confirmed that morales had since december 2016 received the payment, which lifts the president s salary to $27,400 a month.   the president didn t ask for it. instead, it was a group decision by the army,  mansilla said in a press conference.  a technical board of auditors determined the bonus.  the revelation of the unusual salary perk comes at an awkward time for the beleaguered morales, who managed to retain his immunity from prosecution on monday.  congress voted overwhelmingly to protect him after the attorney general submitted a request to investigate morales over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. [nl2n1ls1ev] last month, guatemala s attorney general and the u.n. backed international commission against impunity in guatemala (cicig) jointly sought to investigate morales, a former comedian, over the illegal financing allegation. two days later, morales declared the head of the u.n. body  persona non grata.  under the leadership of ivan velasquez, a veteran colombian prosecutor, cicig has caused problems for morales, first investigating his son and brother then aiming at him. the defense ministry on tuesday posted on its website documents, dated jan. 1, 2016, that detailed the payment to the president and various other military officials.  the considerations (for the bonus) were due to his position and the risks and dangers that (morales) undertakes,  mansilla said in explaining the army s reasoning for the payment.  former presidents alfonso portillo and alvaro colom told reuters they had not received such a bonus. the president s office did not respond to requests for comment.  the salary bonus means that morales earns 70 percent more than chilean leader michelle bachelet and 130 percent more than mexican president enrique pena nieto, two of the region s best paid top officials.  the bonus is also 90 times the $300 minimum wage in guatemala, where 60 percent of the population lives in poverty.

" south africa should raise state spending on higher education by around a third to at least 1 percent of gross domestic product, a report commissioned by the presidency and released on monday found. the recommendation by the commission appointed by president jacob zuma came as a senior treasury official resigned after news reports said he had complained about presidential interference in the budget process, and as state owned utility eskom said it was facing serious liquidity issues. south africa relies on foreign investors to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. investors are nervous ahead of important credit rating reviews scheduled this month and with the ruling african national congress gearing up to elect zuma s successor as party chief in december. the presidency said on monday that zuma would make an announcement on the higher education report once ministers had processed its findings. zuma set up the commission early last year in response to protests by university students demanding free education. the rand and benchmark bonds weakened after the presidency said it would publish the report on monday, but they were little changed after its release. currency traders and analysts said markets were waiting to see how the presidency would react to the report, but they said its recommendations were risky from an economic standpoint.  if we start repeating this pattern of recording higher and higher budget deficits we are undoubtedly headed for downgrades,  said senior nedbank economist nicky weimar. south african gdp was around 4.3 trillion rand ($296.6 billion) last year, so an increase in government spending on higher education of 0.25 percent of gdp would amount to around $750 million of additional expenditure.  the commission also recommended that all university students should be funded through a cost sharing model, whereby the government would guarantee income contingent loans issued by commercial banks. should a student fail to reach a certain income level, the state should repay the tuition loan, it advised. introducing those measures would make it more difficult for treasury to rein in a projected budget deficit of over 4 percent of gdp for the 2017/18 fiscal year.  but it would be popular among young people and anc voters, many of whom are dissatisfied that south african society remains deeply unequal more than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. south africa next holds a national election in 2019, and the anc has seen its electoral majority shrink in elections. south african markets have also been pressured by fears that the independence of financial institutions is under threat. local media outlet fin24 cited sources on monday as saying that treasury deputy director general michael sachs had resigned last week after complaining that zuma was interfering in the budget process. treasury confirmed sachs  resignation, saying only that his departure was because he wanted to  serve the public sector in a different capacity . international ratings agencies downgraded south africa s debt earlier this year after zuma fired respected finance minister pravin gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle. s&p global and moody s are expected to review the country s ratings again on nov. 24, and all eyes are on whether they will downgrade its local currency rating to  junk  status after gordhan s replacement, malusi gigaba, unveiled dismal medium term budget forecasts last month. downgrades to sub investment grade could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of south african bonds and pile further pressure on the rand, which is already trading at a 12 month low against the dollar. south africa s debt insurance costs hit a four month high on monday, reflecting a greater likelihood of ratings downgrades.

" hong kong will try to enact a law penalizing people who boo the chinese national anthem  as soon as possible , an official said on wednesday, in a move that critics say undermines the chinese ruled city s autonomy and freedoms. in the past few years, some hong kong football fans have booed the national anthem during world cup qualifiers and other games, mirroring a more recent protest in the united states with football players kneeling during the national anthem, a practice  denounced by u.s. president donald trump. the asian football confederation warned the hong kong football association on tuesday over the conduct of fans who booed the chinese national anthem in a match in october. china has passed a law stating that disrespecting the anthem could result in imprisonment. the law has come into force in china but has yet to be extended to hong kong.  hong kong secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, patrick nip said the city had a constitutional obligation to follow up the move by china s largely rubber stamp parliament. the law will now be added to the annex of hong kong s mini constitution, the basic law, and put to the city s 70 strong legislature.  we will do it as soon as possible,  nip told lawmakers, while saying there would be a consultation process. hong kong is a former british colony that returned to chinese rule in 1997 under a so called  one country, two systems  formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary. china s growing reach into hong kong s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014  occupy  civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure china to allow full democracy. nip said no decision had been made on jail terms, but the government would make reference to existing laws concerning the desecration of china s national flag that carry a maximum sentence of three years. some critics said this move would further erode hong kong s autonomy and was another instance of china s tightening iron grip.   if a country (china) wasn t using totalitarian and autocratic ways to make people feel under pressure, i believe many more hong kong people would respect the national anthem,  said dennis kwok, a lawmaker with the civic party. over the past few years, hong kong fans have booed the national anthem at several football matches involving the hong kong team, with an upcoming asian cup qualifier between hong kong and lebanon another potential flashpoint.   some inappropriate behavior...must be addressed,  nip said, without giving specifics. chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism into hong kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance hong kong from beijing by embracing the city s culture and core values, with some even advocating independence from china.   in recent years, incidents of disrespecting the national anthem have occurred in hong kong, challenging the bottom line ... and triggering rage,  said zhang rongshun, who leads a legislative affairs commission of china s parliament, the national people s congress, according to the official xinhua news agency.  it is urgent and important to apply the national anthem law in hong kong in a bid to prevent and handle such offences.

" hungary s ruling fidesz party, preparing for elections next april, promised on thursday to highlight what it called a plan by billionaire financier george soros to bring millions of migrants into europe. fidesz asked prime minister viktor orban s government to carry out a  national consultation  about brussels  plans to distribute asylum seekers in the eu, a week after the eu s top court ruled against complainants hungary and slovakia. previous such consultations have taken the form of sending out questionnaires to millions of voters, setting out the government s right wing nationalist position and asking people if they agree. soros, a hungarian born jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro democracy and human rights groups, has been targeted by orban s government repeatedly. his spokesman has described the government s portrayal of his views on immigration as  fantasy . orban has been one of the loudest opponents of mandatory migrant resettlement quotas proposed by the eu, arguing this would undermine its sovereignty and social fabric. his stance has gone down well with voters, and fidesz is firmly ahead in opinion polls. lajos kosa, a party vice chairman, said the national consultation should focus on the alleged soros plan, something that would place migration at the center of the campaign.  the european commission stops just short of saying that they carry out the soros plan... but all their steps and ideas with regard to migration point in this direction,  kosa said, adding last week s eu court defeat for hungary had  opened the gates . soros  spokesman michael vachon in july dismissed the idea that the financier and philanthropist was promoting a scheme to import millions of illegal immigrants into europe.  soros s actual position on migration is that the international community should provide more support to the developing countries that today host 89 percent of refugees and that europe should accept several hundred thousand fully screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement,  he said. he said an anti migrant billboard campaign by the hungarian government, showing a smiling soros and carrying the caption  don t let soros have the last laugh , was  reminiscent of europe s darkest hours . the government ended the poster campaign over the summer.

" a secret meeting at a neighbor’s house, a drive through a back country road, and a clandestine flight on a military jet marked judge neil gorsuch’s journey to the white house this week after u.s. president donald trump chose him as his supreme court nominee. trump, who took office on january 20, called gorsuch on monday to inform him that he had prevailed among a handful of finalists to succeed deceased justice antonin scalia on the high court. that decision set off a rapid and secretive process to get gorsuch to washington without alerting journalists and other supreme court watchers of the president’s selection. after trump called the colorado based judge, a team from the white house counsel’s office flew to denver and then drove to boulder, roughly 45 minutes away, to meet with gorsuch and his family. they met at a neighbor’s house to avoid detection.  then the white house staff spirited him though a “back farm road” to a waiting military plane to transport him to washington, white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on tuesday night in the white house east room. gorsuch stayed at a friend’s residence before being brought to the white house for the tuesday evening announcement. the secrecy continued up until the last minute. when trump, a former reality television star, entered the east room, he came alone, addressing the cameras and the waiting crowd, which included scalia’s widow, at a podium before calling on gorsuch and his wife to come in. trump’s decision came after he narrowed a list of 21 candidates down to six, including thomas hardiman, william pryor, amul thapar, diane sykes, and don willett. then president elect trump interviewed gorsuch, hardiman and pryor on jan. 14 in his new york residence. he also interviewed thapar. “he finalized the decision recently,” after considering all 21 candidates “very deeply,” said kellyanne conway, a senior adviser and counselor to the president. white house counsel don mcgahn informed hardiman, pryor and thapar that they had not been chosen, spicer said.  the white house was determined to keep the president’s supreme court selection a secret and make the announcement of his choice a success after the botched rollout of his refugee executive order contributed to confusion and worldwide criticism last weekend. the strategy to get gorsuch confirmed will kick off right away, spicer said, with former senator kelly ayotte serving as the “sherpa” to help steer the nominee through the senate confirmation process.

" former u.s. house speaker dennis hastert’s lawyers declined on saturday to directly address sexual abuse allegations from federal prosecutors, who asserted that he molested at least four boys decades ago when he served as a high school wrestling coach. hastert, 74, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in october to a federal charge of illegally structuring large bank withdrawals in small increments to evade currency reporting rules. as part of that plea, the former republican speaker of the house of representatives admitted paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades as hush money and compensation for unspecified wrongdoing toward that individual. until this week, neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors had stepped forward to publicly reveal the underlying misconduct at issue. that changed on friday, when prosecutors alleged in a court filing that hastert had sexually abused at least four boys on the wrestling team he coached during his time as a teacher at yorkville high school in the 1960s and ‘70s. providing details of the alleged abuse, some of them quite graphic,  the prosecutors said hastert offered massages to students in a locker room, where he had set up an easy chair in view of the boys’ shower, and inappropriately touched some of the students. they also cited an alleged incident that occurred during a wrestling trip in a motel room. although statutes of limitations bar sexual abuse charges against hastert, “with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted,” the court filing said. asked by reuters if hastert or his lawyers would comment on the court filing, a pre sentencing memorandum, hastert attorney thomas green issued a statement that neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. hastert “acknowledges that as a young man he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry,” the statement said. “he earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused.” the wording closely mirrored a similar expression of remorse contained in a pre sentencing memo filed by the defense earlier this week. it differed, however, in expressly mentioning “former students.” the defense has asked the federal judge in the case to spare hastert prison time, citing his deteriorating health, his remorse and years he “dedicated to public service.” prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months.  sentencing is scheduled for april 27.

" economic sanctions are a powerful policy weapon but should not be wielded “frivolously,” u.s. treasury secretary jack lew said in an interview to be aired on tuesday. sanctions   blacklisting individuals and organizations, effectively barring them from the global financial system   have become a favored tool for the united states. it has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking, cyber attacks and jihadist financing. but the impact has to be weighed as carefully as those of military force, lew said in an interview with public television host charlie rose, according to a transcript of the interview released on tuesday. “we can’t shy away from using sanctions because it will slow down growth, but we can’t do it frivolously either,” lew said. “it’s a serious step, and it’s something that has to be guarded in order to have it in the future when you need it.” u.s. sanctions have evolved over time from broad embargoes   such as the one imposed for decades on cuba   to more targeted actions, he said, citing measures imposed on specific russian industries in response to russia’s intervention in ukraine. “they’re targeted at the centers of power, where the decisions are being made,” lew said. the united states also should reward countries that change their behavior by removing sanctions, lew said, pointing to measures against iran that he credited with leading tehran to agree to curb its nuclear program. iran reached a deal with the united states and other world powers last july, winning relief from the harshest sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear program, which the west feared was aimed at building a weapon. “when you have an agreement that’s predicated on ‘change your policy and get relief from the sanctions,’ there has to be relief from the sanctions,” lew said. “otherwise, no one will ever respond to a sanctions regime by changing their policy.” reversing the iran nuclear deal under a new administration   as republican presidential candidate and u.s. senator ted cruz has pledged to do   would be “destabilizing and dangerous,” lew said. a broad economic embargo remains in place against cuba, although president barack obama has used executive authority to allow commerce not specifically banned by congress, as washington and havana move closer toward normal relations. those improved ties are “going to be a force for change” in cuba, lew said. “we weren’t getting it done the old way.” ",0
" u.s. arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by nearly 40 percent in the first 100 days of donald trump’s presidency, following executive orders that broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations, according to government data released on wednesday. the acting director of immigration and customs enforcement (ice) thomas homan said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between january 22 of this year and the end of april, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year.  of those arrested almost two thirds had criminal convictions. but there was also a significant jump   of more than 150 percent   in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ice: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non criminal arrests in the same period in 2016. that increase is a result of recent guidance given by homeland security secretary john kelly to implement trump’s executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on jan. 25, just days after the republican president took office.  “those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,” homan said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency. he said ice will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime. “when a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,” homan said. “if we don’t take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.”  while president barack obama was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally.  deportations under trump have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under obama, homan said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system.   the number of people caught crossing the border with mexico is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from u.s. customs and border protection. immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.  on wednesday, state attorneys general from new york, california, oregon, rhode island, washington state and washington d.c., issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents.  a section of one of the president’s executive orders aimed to cut off federal funding to so called “sanctuary cities,” was been blocked by a federal judge in california.

" prime minister theresa may will only detail how big a divorce settlement britain is willing to pay the eu when the bloc gives a commitment to moving talks forward, according to a plan rubber stamped by even her most pro brexit ministers. the brexit bill has become one of several hurdles to talks to unravel more than 40 years of union, with london reticent to offer too much too soon on what officials consider to be one of its strongest bargaining chips. in brussels, british media speculation that may has won the backing of brexit hardliners to offer more cash prompted talk among eu diplomats that a deal to unblock talks on future trade relations could be in the making ahead of a crunch brussels summit in three weeks. at a meeting on monday, may s brexit committee   made up of some of her top ministers   backed the long held strategy that britain would honor commitments made when it was a member of the european union. but the government will only offer any specifics when the bloc s negotiators give a commitment that talks will move to a discussion of the future relationship.  we are ready to move onto phase two, to see those talks about a deep and special partnership with the eu for the future, a comprehensive trade agreement with the eu,  may said on tuesday.  i think that s in the interests of the uk and in the interests of the remaining eu 27. i think it s also important that the uk and the eu step forward together,  she added, a turn of phrase a source said expressed her desire for coordination. in public, brussels is standing firm on the need for britain to first make clear not a concrete  euros and cents  offer but a commitment to pay a share of eu spending for some items after brexit   one of three key conditions the eu has set for opening trade talks. asked if the eu was ready to give a promise to start those talks as soon as london offers more money, european commission deputy head frans timmermans told cnn:  i hear them saying that. but as far as the eu27 is concerned, ... if we tackle the three issues ... if we deal with that satisfactorily, we can move to the next stage. and that s been crystal clear since day one.  nonetheless, eu negotiators are willing to help may with at least the appearance of cutting a deal. they could help  fudge  the amount of cash being handed over. and the eu already has an outline of a transition and free trade accord, which may could point to as something she had secured in exchange.  we are ready to present the exit bill in a way that would make it easier for the brits to sell at home,  one diplomat said. he added that eu officials had looked at whether britain might forgo its roughly 50 percent rebate on eu budget payments during a two year transition period after brexit, so reducing the gross amount britain would otherwise hand over in advance. with only 16 months until britain leaves the bloc, may is under increasing pressure not only from eu officials to move on the money, but also by businesses to provide certainty by early next year so they can make investment decisions. but she has a tightrope to walk.  many in her governing conservative party want britain to quit the talks, feeling the eu is holding the country hostage over money, which they want to spend at home rather than abroad. her spokesman said no figures were discussed at monday s meeting and other ministers gave no details of what was discussed.  local media reported that she could increase the sum to 40 billion pounds ($53 billion), more than double the initial estimated offer of 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion). the commission has cited a figure of 60 billion euros but eu officials have long said that is up for negotiation. for many in may s own party, however, the suggestion of any increase in how much britain will pay at a time when talks had failed to move forward for five months was unpalatable.  i need to be able to look my voters in the eye and be able to say that i have backed a deal that is in the interests of britain,  conservative lawmaker andrew bridgen told reuters.  if i can t do that, i will vote against a deal and we will go to wto rules of trade, rules with which we already trade with most of the world successfully.

" embarrassed by donald trump’s rhetoric against mexico, former world bank president robert zoellick said on wednesday it is time to “remake” the case for free trade in the united states.  the u.s. presidential race has been peppered with promises to rework trade policy in the united states’ favor, and many of the strongest attacks have been against the north american free trade agreement (nafta), a trade accord between the united states, mexico and canada that took effect in 1994. regarded by mexican policymakers as a milestone in the country’s economic modernization, nafta has been vilified by republican front runner trump and democratic hopeful bernie sanders as a job killing betrayal of u.s. industry. zoellick, a republican who also served as u.s. trade representative under president george w. bush, said mexican officials had understandably been unsettled by trump’s rhetoric and flagging u.s. congressional support for free trade. “the bigger issue in the u.s. will be a need to remake the case for trade,” he said in a phone interview. that meant more than the traditional corporate lobbying in congress, said zoellick, who was world bank chief from 2007 2012. “this is now going to need a broader public push. part of this will be a challenge to get the facebooks, the googles the apples and others to not only make the case in washington, but actually use social media, use big data resources and others to explain this to coming generations of americans,” he said. while noting that some americans had good reason to feel concern about the pace of change and unfettered immigration, zoellick said mexico, a “significant, modernizing economy”, ought to be integrated further into u.s. thinking. “if it were up to me, i would bring canada and mexico into the ttip negotiations with europe,” he said, referring to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, a planned trade deal between the united states and the european union. after china and canada, mexico is the united states’ third biggest trade partner, accounting for bilateral commerce worth around $500 billion annually. the united states is also home to an estimated 35 million people of mexican origin. claiming mexico is “killing” the united states on trade and sending rapists and drug runners north, trump has threatened to impose tariffs against mexico and vowed to build a wall to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border. to make mexico pay for the wall, he has threatened to block billions of dollars in remittances sent home by mexicans in the united states, a plan zoellick described as “outrageous.” “as an american, frankly, i’m embarrassed by his statements,” he said. however, he noted the mexican government had to “walk a fine line” in countering trump without stoking more tensions. a number of serving and former mexican officials believe their government could have been more active in persuading u.s. businesses and politicians to make the case that both countries will lose out if trump’s talk becomes reality. zoellick said, however, it was a shared responsibility.  “depending on one’s perspective, this is really ... the u.s.’s burden to bear. and so while i concur that one would welcome assistance from mexico, in some ways we’ve got to get our own act cleaned up in the u.s. first,” he said.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry is confident after speaking to his philippine counterpart that the two countries can “work through” a period of confusion caused by anti american rhetoric from president rodrigo duterte, the state department said on monday. state department spokesman john kirby said kerry expressed concern in his conversation on sunday with foreign minister perfecto yasay about the tone of remarks by the philippine president, who has sharply criticized president barack obama and talked of separation from washington. at the same time, kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while kirby said washington had seen no practical action by manila to move away from those. kerry’s conversation with yasay came after duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a “separation” from the united states and realignment with china during a visit to beijing. although duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a u.s. philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting u.s. power in asia in the face of fast rising china. earlier on monday, the most senior u.s. diplomat for asia,  assistant secretary of state for east asia daniel russel, said in manila that washington remained a “trusted” ally to the philippines and supported its blossoming ties with china. russel was the first high level visitor from washington since duterte’s remarks and kirby said that both russel and kerry made clear the united states had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the philippines. “the tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this,” kirby told a regular news briefing.  in his comments to reporters, russel said he had candidly told yasay that manila’s friends were concerned about the high loss of life in duterte’s campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process. russel said “a real climate of uncertainty about the philippines’ intentions had created consternation in many countries,” including the united states. he said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was “bad for business” in “a very competitive region.” since duterte took office on june 30, he has been scathing about u.s. criticism of his anti drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. but his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks. explaining duterte’s “goodbye america” remarks, yasay said on saturday the united states remained the “closest friend” of the philippines but that manila wanted to break away from a “mindset of dependency and subservience” and forge closer ties with other nations. russel said duterte himself had “already walked back” his remarks and added that washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the philippines and china. “we don’t want countries to have to choose between the u.s. and china,” he said.

" fourteen years after criticizing augusta national golf club for its all male membership policy, women’s issues expert martha burk has called for next year’s u.s. women’s open to be moved from trump national in new jersey. in a blog for the huffington post on friday, burk lambasted tournament organizers, the united states golf association, for placing “profit over principle” and added a link to a petition to force the usga to hold the event elsewhere. “seems the usga, no stranger to hypocrisy, refuses to move next year’s u.s. women’s open from the trump owned bedminster club, even though the usga issued a public statement condemning trump’s racist views after his ‘mexican rapist’ rant when he announced his candidacy,” burk wrote. republican presidential candidate trump has angered many people with his polarizing words on the campaign trail, including his promise to build a wall on the u.s. mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar muslims from entering the country. his antagonistic comments have already cost him in the golfing world. the elite pga grand slam of golf, a 36 hole stroke play event that features the winners of the season’s four majors, was scrapped last year due to complications over the proposed venue, trump’s national course in los angeles. last month, the pga tour announced that its long established tournament in miami would move from trump’s doral course to mexico city next year, a switch prompted by sponsorship issues. with the 2016 u.s. women’s open being played this week at cordevalle in san martin, california, burk has turned her attention to next year’s edition, even though “the protest is not over exclusionary policies at bedminster, if there are any”. she wrote: “the objection is to one of the ruling bodies of golf kowtowing to trump’s overtly racist and sexist views. that shows where the usga really stands, despite the lip service only condemnation a year ago.” the usga, pga tour, lpga and pga of america had distanced themselves from trump’s explosive comments in a joint statement issued last august. burk referenced the augusta national controversy, saying “the usga ignored its prohibition against holding events at clubs that discriminate on the basis of race or gender by standing solidly behind the trump like dinos holding the masters tournament   even though it was clearly in violation of their own by laws.” augusta national’s membership policy had been an issue for years, most notably in 2002 when burk led a series of protests that prompted a heated war of words with augusta’s then chairman hootie johnson. “there may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership, but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet,” johnson declared at the time. augusta national, home of the masters golf tournament, finally ended an all male policy that had endured for 80 years when it announced in august 2012 that two women would be admitted as members for the first time. burk, a co founder of the center for advancement of public policy, is director of the corporate accountability project for the national council of women’s organizations.

 u.s. president donald trump told reporters on monday that a lawsuit accusing him of violating the u.s. constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments was “without merit.” his remarks to reporters in the oval office coincided with a letter by democratic lawmakers asking the u.s. general services administration what it was doing about trump’s hotel lease for the old post office building. they said the lease states that no elected official of the federal government can share in the agreement or benefit from it. ,0
" a saudi backed islamic military coalition will provide logistical, intelligence and training to a new west african counter terrorism force that is struggling to get off the ground, saudi arabia s foreign minister said. the announcement by adel al jubeir signals the involvement in the sahel of a muslim military alliance widely seen as a vehicle for countering the growing influence of riyadh s rival iran. saudi arabia and the united arab emirates on wednesday agreed to provide about $150 million to the g5 sahel force, which is composed of the armies of mali, mauritania, niger, burkina faso and chad, a sign that gulf arab states are upping their influence in the region. the sunni muslim kingdom is seeking to check the ambitions of shi ite power iran to expand its clout in west africa and across the muslim world. speaking in an interview with france 24 television, adel al jubeir said his country s contribution would go much further by using the platform of the recently established islamic military counter terrorism coalition to support the g5 sahel.  because of our commitment to fighting terrorism and extremism we made the commitment to provide 100 million euros to these forces and we made this commitment also to provide logistics, training, intelligence and air support through the islamic military coalition to this effort,  jubeir said. some 40 muslim majority nations met in riyadh at the end of november to begin fleshing it out details of the alliance first conceived two years by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, but that until now has yet to take any decisive international action in its mandate to fight terrorism. the crown prince has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of islam in the ultra conservative kingdom and wants the coalition, which will have a permanent base in riyadh, to help combat terrorist financing and ideology.  we will be hosting a meeting of this new group to coordinate this military support to those (g5) countries,  jubeir said, referring to a meeting the islamic alliance, adding that riyadh would also provide humanitarian assistance. the g5 sahel launched a symbolic military operation to mark its creation in october amid growing unrest in the sahel, whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists, including affiliates of al qaeda and islamic state. however, france, which has 4,500 troops in the region, has been dismayed to see the militants score military and symbolic victories in west africa while the g5 force has struggled to win financing and become operational. after a meeting in paris on wednesday, the french and malian leaders said they hoped the g5 would secure its first victories by the middle of 2018 to prove its worth and ensure more concrete support from the united nations. in rome, a defense ministry official said italy will send several hundred troops to niger, a member of the g5 sahel, next year to help train local forces battling jihadi militants. prime minister paolo gentiloni signaled the initiative on wednesday, telling the g5 meeting in france that italy would divert some of its forces in iraq to niger, a country that straddles an expanse of the sahara desert.  niger has requested help with training men involved in border controls and we will certainly be setting up a mission there,  the defense ministry official said, declining to be named.  the official declined to confirm a report in la repubblica newspaper that some 470 men would be sent to niger to help with both training and surveillance, saying full details of the operation had not yet been finalised. despite agreement on principles, members of the saudi backed alliance have voiced different priorities slowing its implementation. critics say the coalition could become a means for saudi arabia to implement an even more assertive foreign policy by winning the backing of poorer african and asian nations with offers of financial and military aid.

" celebrations in brussels to mark morocco s return to soccer s world cup finals for the first time in two decades turned violent late on saturday, when crowds clashed with police, setting cars on fire and injuring 22 police officers. images on social media showed overturned, burning cars and broken shop windows in brussels city center as well as police trucks firing water cannons at crowds gathered in front of the city s stock exchange. brussels police said that of some 1,500 people had come to celebrate morocco s 2 0 win over ivory coast, but that around 300 started to behave violently and attacked police officers and firemen called to put out burning cars and dust bins. more than 100,000 people of moroccan origin live in brussels. belgium saw an influx of moroccan workers in the 1960s and 1970s. prosecutors said that by sunday morning no arrests had been made, but belgium s interior minister vowed to hold those responsible to account, calling the events unacceptable.  the fundamental problem is that such events are used as an excuse for reckless behavior and doing unacceptable things,  interior minister jan jambon told belgium s radio 1.  we have camera images   whoever did this will pay for this, there is no way around it,  jambon added.

" u.s. senate republicans said tuesday they will seek to bring their healthcare overhaul to the senate floor next week after a lengthy intraparty struggle, but it remained unclear whether they had the votes to pass the measure or even what form it would finally take.  with his reputation as a master strategist on the line, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell laid out a timetable for senate consideration of legislation to fulfill president donald trump’s campaign promise to dismantle the 2010 affordable care act, also known as obamacare. in a departure from republican orthodoxy on tax cutting, the legislation likely will retain some of the taxes that were imposed on the wealthy under obamacare, senate sources said. but it was unknown whether a revised version of the bill to be announced on thursday morning can satisfy both moderates and hard line conservatives in the republican majority who voiced opposition to a draft unveiled last month on very different grounds. with trump urging the senate to act before taking the august break, mcconnell pushed back the senate’s planned august recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. mcconnell’s announcement drove a turn around in stock prices in afternoon trading on wall street after an earlier sell off, on hopes that a shortened recess could mean progress on the stalled republican legislative agenda.  a dark mood lingered among some republicans over the healthcare subject, with party leaders appearing to act because of the need to dispense with healthcare and turn to other issues, among them increasing the u.s. debt ceiling. “i think we’ve narrowed down now to where we know where the decision points are, and we just have to make those decisions,” senator john thune, a junior member of the republican leadership, told reporters. leaders were still trying to “figure out how we get to 50” votes, he said. republicans, who hold 52 seats in the 100 seat senate, would need 50 votes to pass the bill, with vice president mike pence providing the tie breaking vote. “i am very pessimistic” about the prospects for republican healthcare legislation, chuck grassley, a senior senator, told fox news on tuesday. another republican senator, lindsey graham, was working on his own healthcare proposal and will unveil it this week, a graham aide said. mcconnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week, and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan congressional budget office at the start of the week. he did not reveal any of the planned changes to the draft, on which he postponed action last month after it failed to gather enough support. but senate sources said it is likely that two obamacare taxes on the wealthy will be kept in place   a 3.8 percent net investment tax and a 0.9 percent payroll tax that helps finance medicare   which would appeal to moderates who have balked at the prospect of cutting taxes for the wealthy while reducing benefits for the poor. “obviously that’s the direction i think that a lot of our members want to move, is to keep some of those (taxes) in place and be able to use those revenues to put it into other places in the bill,” thune said, while stressing that no decisions were final. republicans could also retain obamacare’s limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry, one senate source said. it was unclear whether the bill would include a proposal by conservative republican ted cruz that would allow insurers to offer basic low cost healthcare plans that do not comply with obamacare regulations. cruz argues it would help to lower premiums, but critics say it would allow insurers to offer skimpier plans that may not cover essential health benefits while also charging more for more comprehensive, obamacare compliant plans. the senate republican healthcare bill unveiled last month would phase out the obamacare expansion of medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal many of obamacare’s taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul obamacare’s subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. democrats are united in opposition to the bill and at least 10 republicans have said they oppose the existing draft. the house of representatives passed its own version in may. moderate republicans are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the draft legislation, and hard line conservatives say it leaves too much of obamacare intact. democrats call the republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt the most vulnerable americans.

" uzbekistan has abruptly recalled thousands of school teachers, college students and healthcare workers from cotton fields, halting a practice condemned abroad as forced labor, government officials and other sources told reuters on friday. the central asian nation is one of the world s leading cotton exporters and for years it has mobilized the students as well as staff at schools and clinics to pick the autumn harvest. it phased out using minors in 2015 under international pressure that included boycott campaigns. officially, the work is voluntary and paid at about $0.005 per kilogram. in reality those who refuse risk expulsion or the sack unless they bribe an official or hire someone to work in their place, sources said. the harvest started this month but late on thursday the tashkent government ordered the cotton pickers home, said a district official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. the government declined to comment. a central government official who also asked not to be named said an order barring the use of such workers had in fact been issued in august. on thursday tashkent warned regional governors they would be sacked if they fail to comply with it. the district official said regional governments have been ordered to hire unemployed locals for cotton picking instead. several students and a school director, who all requested anonymity, said they had been ordered to return to class or had their trips to the field canceled at the last moment. despite ending the use of child labor, uzbekistan ranked among the top five worst offenders in the global slavery index compiled last year by activist group walk free foundation. the group estimated that almost 4 percent of uzbekistan s population   then 31 million   lived in  modern slavery,  putting it second only to north korea by that metric. the move to end the practice follows reforms by president shavkat mirziyoyev who took over the former soviet republic after the death of strongman leader islam karimov last september. mirziyoyev has moved to liberalize foreign exchange and travel regulations and had about 16,000 people struck off a blacklist of potential extremists, reforms that may help him rebuild ties with the west and attract foreign investment.

" a report that mexico s attorney general owns a ferrari registered at an unoccupied house has added a twist to a growing political battle over who will lead a new institution designed to battle corruption. the report by a mexican anti graft group published on monday said mexican attorney general raul cervantes had a $218,000 ferrari registered at an apparently unoccupied house, worth $25,000, in the state of morelos that also had two other ferraris and an audi registered to the same address. cervantes said through his lawyer he bought a 2011 ferrari with his earnings as a private lawyer before entering public service, and that it was registered at that address by the company that had imported the luxury car. cervantes is already at the center of a growing political battle in mexico, which is implementing a new anti corruption system that will replace the current attorney general s office with a new institution next year that is designed to be more independent from political interference. president enrique pena nieto s administration has been hit by conflict of interest scandals and his institutional revolutionary party (pri) has been battered by corruption allegations against several governors. revelations about the lavish lifestyles of politicians has further damaged the popularity of the ruling class in a country where 44 percent of people are officially poor.  opposition lawmakers have objected to allowing cervantes to become the head of the new prosecutor general s office, a figure who will serve a 9 year term in a move away from the current system where the president nominates the attorney general. ricardo anaya, the head of the conservative national action party, said in a video posted online at the weekend that cervantes could protect members of the pri from facing corruption charges if he becomes the new prosecutor general. anaya has himself been the subject of recent media reports that said his wife s parents had significantly expanded business and real estate holdings in recent years. anaya has denied any wrongdoing. cervantes  lawyer said the registration of the ferrari was an administrative error.   dr. cervantes only found out about it this very morning in the newspaper and has already made the corresponding administrative adjustments,  lawyer cristina rocha wrote in a letter reposted on cervantes twitter page.   in this case, there is nothing illegal, there was only an administrative error in the registry of one address for another in morelos,  the letter said. mexicans against corruption and impunity said documents showed 16 luxury cars had been registered to just four homes on the same street of low cost town houses. the report said neighbors had never seen fancy cars on their street and said the homes in question seemed to be uninhabited.

" nigeria s president muhammadu buhari told members of his party before he was first elected that he would only seek one term, implying he did not intend at that time to run in 2019, the minister of women s affairs told reuters on wednesday. the comments by aisha alhassan could heighten uncertainty over whether buhari plans to contest the next election. buhari took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness. he is yet to say if he will seek a second term.  in 2014/2015 he said he was going to run for only one time to clean up the mess that the (previous) pdp government did in nigeria. and i took him for his word that he is not contesting in 2019,  minister of women affairs alhassan said. alhassan said in the interview she would resign if buhari seeks re election and would support former vice president atiku abubakar if he decides to run. alhassan s portfolio ranks relatively low down in nigeria s cabinet. abubakar was vice president from 1999 to 2007 as part of the people s democratic party (pdp). he joined the all progressives congress (apc), buhari s party, in 2014. she said buhari made the comments in 2015 to apc members but gave no further details. the president s two spokesmen declined to comment on the minister s remarks.  buhari, 74, returned on aug. 19 from three months of medical leave in britain for an unspecified ailment. it was his second stint of sick leave this year following a break between january and march.  many people say they doubt whether buhari is well enough to serve another term in nigeria, which is africa s most populous country and has the continent s biggest economy.  if today mr. president says he is running in 2019 i will go to him respectfully and thank him for giving me an opportunity to serve and then tell him that i have to resign because my political father may be running,  said alhassan.

" democratic u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign has solicited advice from california regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn based ethanol be blended into the nation’s gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials.     the move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the renewable fuel standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn growing states like iowa where she faces a tough battle against republican rival donald trump in the nov. 8 election. the renewable fuel standard, created by congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the united states contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. it was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the u.s. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. it is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  clinton advisers have contacted the california air resources board (carb) to discuss whether a policy like california’s low carbon fuel standard, a market based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the renewable fuel standard, and other issues, carb officials said. mary nichols, head of the carb, said she discussed the state’s regulations with clinton advisers. while a backer of the low carbon fuel standard, nichols said she told clinton’s advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal fired electricity. nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. a clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with carb but gave no further details.  a campaign spokesman, tyrone gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from “a diverse set of stakeholders.” he added that the clinton campaign “does not support replacing the rfs with a national low carbon fuel standard” but did not elaborate. former obama administration climate and energy adviser heather zichal said on the sidelines of the democratic national convention in philadelphia last week that the renewable fuel standard was broken, but that a clinton administration could make “modifications” to fix it. “mandates aren’t necessarily a perfect way to regulate,” zichal said at the event. the u.s. corn lobby hopes to convince both clinton and trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of u.s. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. the program is designed to last indefinitely after that. environmentalists, anti hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. market based system the california regulation, a key part of the state’s effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companies to decide how to reach that target.     california enacted the low carbon fuel standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the state’s market. it angered midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. clinton in may expressed support for the federal renewable fuel standard in an opinion piece published in an iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. clinton’s openness to overhauling the renewable fuel standard appears to contrast with trump’s position. during the state by state battle for the republican presidential nomination, trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the renewable fuel standard. corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the clinton and trump campaigns to argue in favor of the renewable fuel standard.

" a u.s. state department video of a press briefing about secret u.s. iran nuclear talks was deliberately edited but there is no evidence to suggest the cut was intended to hide information, a u.s. spokesman said on thursday after further details were released of an investigation into the incident. “we are confident the video of that press briefing was deliberately edited,” state department spokesman john kirby told reporters, adding: “what we were not able to determine is why the edit was made in the first place. there’s no evidence to suggest it was made with the intent to conceal information from the public.” the excised portion of a dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the united states was holding secret direct nuclear talks with iran. the state department initially said it was caused by a “glitch” but later said it was a deliberate omission. kirby said the investigation by the department’s office of the legal adviser could not rule out that a technical glitch might have deleted the portion of the video because of the “choppy nature of the cut.” he said the findings had now been shared with secretary of state john kerry and with congressional members.

" president barack obama on tuesday nominated career diplomat jeffrey delaurentis to be the first u.s. ambassador to cuba in more than five decades, setting up a fierce confirmation battle with republicans in congress opposed to obama’s opening with the communist ruled island. the appointment of delaurentis, the top american official at the u.s. embassy in havana since relations were restored last year, marked obama’s latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former cold war foes before he leaves office in january. the nomination must be approved by the republican controlled senate, which is seen as a long shot, especially in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from cuban american senators including marco rubio of florida and ted cruz of texas. rubio, in a blistering statement, derided the nomination as a “last ditch legacy project” by obama and said it “should go nowhere.” an individual senator has the power   one that is often invoked   to put a “hold” on an ambassadorial nomination to delay a full senate vote. in a veiled appeal to lawmakers, obama praised delaurentis for his leadership during the normalization process. “we only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador” in havana, he said in a statement. “having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the cuban government,” obama said. delaurentis had been widely tipped for the post. but the president held off naming him until now even as cuba appointed its own ambassador to washington shortly after embassies were reopened in both countries’ capitals in july of last year. he would be the first u.s. envoy since philip bonsal, an appointee of president dwight eisenhower, left the post vacant in late 1960. obama traveled to havana in march, the first visit by a u.s. president in 88 years. the trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after cuba’s 1959 revolution. since the opening, obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing cuba to accelerate cautious market style reforms and allow greater political and economic freedom. even so, the u.s. embargo against cuba remains in place, a major irritant in relations. only congress can lift the embargo, and the republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. delaurentis has been u.s. chief of mission in cuba since august 2014, his third posting in havana. he has also held diplomatic posts at the state department in washington, at the u.s. mission to the united nations and in bogota.

" for david green, head of the detroit chapter of the democratic socialists of america (dsa), donald trump’s victory in november was both distressing and cause for optimism in his quest to pull the democratic party to the left.     “we need a party that’s open to progressive forces, and that’s why we have to elect progressive leadership within the party,” green said, while attending the michigan democratic party’s spring convention in detroit earlier this month.     membership in the dsa, founded in 1982, has surged since trump’s election on nov. 8, putting the movement in a position to make inroads on the democratic party’s energized left. the membership gains are fueled by supporters of bernie sanders, the u.s. senator from vermont who sought the democratic presidential nomination last year.  the dsa is not a political party, but it supports many of the same short term policy positions as the sanders wing of the democratic party: a $15 minimum wage, single payer healthcare, free college, and opposition to free trade deals.     but unlike most mainstream democrats, the dsa also has a long term vision of a democratic socialist society in the vein of countries like sweden and denmark, where workers have a more direct say in how their jobs and the economy are run, alongside a more robust public sector. since november, national membership has almost tripled to about 17,000. its leaders have said meetings are packed and new chapters are cropping up nationwide, including in rust belt states such as michigan, wisconsin and ohio, where trump scored upset wins over democratic candidate hillary clinton to take the white house.     the dsa’s membership is tiny in the grand picture. in the 31 states plus the district of columbia where party registrations are tallied, the democratic party alone has about 45 million members.     hans noel, a political scientist at georgetown university,  said while the dsa’s numbers remain small, its growth reflects a trend of the democratic party’s left wing gaining clout after clinton’s loss. many analysts said her defeat was at least partly due to her inability to win over sanders’ supporters.     noel notes the election this coming weekend of a new chair for the democratic national committee, seen as a dead heat between sanders supporter keith ellison, whom dsa supports, and clinton supporter tom perez. noel said it is not only a key inflection point but also a demonstration of the progressive bloc’s newfound power.     “they’re doing more mobilization and organization within the party ... all of the candidates now feel this is a wing of the party they feel they have to take seriously,” noel said in an interview. “that kind of action is probably going to play out in internal party conflict over the next two to three years.”     the surge has buoyed the spirits of dsa officials including national director maria svart, who says the surge in new members began immediately after trump’s victory.     “the day after the election, our membership coordinator turned to me when she looked at her computer in the morning and said ‘i can see the moment when donald trump announced that he’d won,’” svart said. “people started joining online in massive numbers.”     trump’s election has galvanized not only the dsa but other left leaning political groups. since the jan. 20 inauguration, protests against his policies and pronouncements have drawn tens of thousands of people nearly every weekend, providing new opportunities for the dsa and other groups to attract supporters. “we’re not going to work within the democratic party, but we’re not going to work totally outside it either,” svart said in an interview, adding that the dsa would eventually like to run its own candidates for office.     at the michigan democratic convention, green and his dsa chapter were successful in getting several members elected to the michigan democratic party’s state central committee for the first time in over two decades. in january, sanders supporters in california managed to elect a majority of delegates to that state’s party leadership.     “state politics is where a lot of policy is done so it matters who’s running for these offices,” georgetown’s noel said. “control over who gets to be candidates is huge and these people have control over that in these positions.” ",0
" russia s foreign ministry has summoned a u.s. diplomat in moscow to hand him a note of protest over plans to conduct searches in russia s trade mission complex in washington, which should soon be closed, the ministry said in a statement on saturday. it said it has summoned anthony f. godfrey, a deputy chief of mission at the u.s. embassy in moscow. the ministry called the planned  illegal inspection  of russian diplomatic housing an  unprecedented aggressive action , which could be used by the u.s. special services for  anti russian provocations  by the way of  planting compromised items . the closure by sept. 2 of the consulate and buildings in washington and new york that house russian trade missions is the latest in tit for tat actions by the two countries that have helped push relations to a new post cold war low. the kremlin has said the moves to close the russian facilities pushed bilateral ties further into a dead end. on friday, the russian foreign ministry also said the u.s. special services were prepared for searches in its consulate in san francisco. some media reported that a smoke was billowing from a chimney of the building. maria zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, said it was part of a  mothballing .  in relation to this, the windows could be closed, the light could be turned off, the water could be drained out, the heating appliances could be turned off, the garbage could be thrown away, essential services could be turned off and many other things,  she wrote on social media. moscow last month ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of russian diplomats in the united states, after congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against russia.

" the airport on the indonesian holiday island of bali reopened on wednesday as wind blew away ash spewed out by a volcano, giving airlines a window to get tourists out while authorities stepped up efforts to get thousands of villagers to move to safety. operations at the airport   the second busiest in indonesia   have been disrupted since the weekend when mount agung, in east bali, began belching out huge clouds of smoke and ash, and authorities warned of an  imminent threat  of a major eruption.  bali s international airport started operating normally,  air traffic control provider airnav said in a statement, adding that operations resumed at 2:28 p.m. (0628 gmt). the reopening of the airport, which is about 60 km (37 miles) away from mount agung, followed a downgrade in an aviation warning to one level below the most serious, with the arrival of more favorable winds.  we really hope that we actually get a flight, maybe today or tomorrow, to get back home,  said tourist nathan james, from the australian city of brisbane, waiting at the airport. a large plume of white and grey ash and smoke hovered over agung on wednesday, after night time rain partially obscured a fiery glow at its peak. president joko widodo begged villagers living in a danger zone around the volcano to move to emergency centers. sutopo purwo nugroho of the disaster mitigation agency said about 43,000 people had heeded advice to take shelter, but an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people were living in the zone. the decision to resume flights followed an emergency meeting at the airport, when authorities weighing up weather conditions, tests and data from airnav and other groups. flight tracking website flightradar24 later showed there were flights departing and arriving at the airport although its general manager said if the wind changed direction the airport could be closed again at short notice. agung looms over eastern bali to a height of just over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet). its last major eruption in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages. ash coated cars, roofs and roads to the southeast of the crater on wednesday and children wore masks as they walked to school. singapore airlines ltd (sial.si) said it would resume flights while australia s qantas airways ltd (qan.ax) said it and budget arm jetstar would run 16 flights to australia on thursday to ferry home 3,800 stranded customers. singapore airlines and silkair were seeking approval to operate additional flights on thursday, while budget offshoot scoot said it would cease offering land and ferry transport to the city of surabaya, on java island, as it resumed flights to bali. virgin australia plans to operate up to four recovery flights to denpasar on thursday.   as the volcanic activity remains unpredictable, these flights may be canceled at short notice,  it said on its website. the head of the weather agency at bali airport, bambang hargiyono, said winds had begun to blow from the north to south, carrying ash toward the neighboring island of lombok. he said the wind was expected to shift toward the southeast  for the next three days , which should allow flights to operate. as many as 430 domestic and international flights had been disrupted on wednesday. authorities are urging villagers living up to 10 km (6 miles) from the volcano to move to emergency centers, but some are reluctant to leave homes and livestock.  those in the 8  to 10 km radius must truly take refuge for safety,  widodo told reporters.  there must not be any victims.    interactive graphic: 'mount agung awakens' click tmsnrt.rs/2aayrvh graphic: 'ring of fire' click tmsnrt.rs/2azr9jv ",0
" u.s. president elect donald trump planned a saturday meeting with mitt romney, the 2012 republican presidential nominee and fierce trump critic, and may discuss whether he should be a candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the meeting said on thursday. trump already has a lengthy list of potential candidates for the post of top u.s. diplomat, including former new york mayor rudy giuliani, former u.s. ambassador to the united nations john bolton, u.s. senator bob corker of tennessee, and south carolina governor nikki haley, who met trump on thursday. trump, a former reality tv star, has shown a flair for the dramatic in his deliberations over his cabinet, saying only he knows who “the finalists” are. corker told cnn on wednesday he was “in the mix” for the position but that trump might pick someone who was closer to him during the presidential campaign. he met on thursday in washington with vice president elect mike pence. trump’s expected meeting with romney amounts to an olive branch of sorts to one of his sharpest critics. romney, who in a speech in march called trump “a phony, a fraud,” urged republicans to vote for anyone but the new york real estate magnate while the party was picking its presidential nominee. trump, in turn, used harsh rhetoric at times during his campaign to dismiss romney as a failure who blew a chance in 2012 to defeat democratic president barack obama, whom trump felt was a weak opponent. the source told reuters that a broad discussion was expected during the meeting and that discussion about the secretary of state position was possible. the source had said earlier his understanding was that the meeting would occur on sunday. asked about the meeting, trump senior adviser kellyanne conway suggested it was still being arranged. “we’re working on it,” she said.  “i think it’s good that the president elect is meeting with people like mr. romney,” u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, one of trump’s closest confidants and a potential nominee for defense secretary, told reporters at manhattan’s trump tower. sessions sounded far from certain romney would be offered a job. “there are a lot of talented people that he (trump) needs good relationships with. and i think mr. romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things. but he will be one of those, i am sure, that’s reviewed. donald trump will make that decision,” sessions said. when romney, a former massachusetts governor, opted out of running for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, people close to him suggested that serving as secretary of state might be appealing to him if a republican won the presidency. a steady stream of potential trump administration hires made their way through the lobby of trump tower to meet with either trump or officials close to him. all indicated a willingness to serve, such as jeb hensarling, a texas republican who is chairman of the u.s. house of representatives financial services committee. he is a potential treasury secretary in the trump administration. “i stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible. i’ve got a great position in public policy today, if he wants to talk to me obviously, about serving somewhere else, we’ll look at serving somewhere else,” he told reporters.

" a u.s. house of representatives committee on tuesday approved an amendment to an agricultural funding bill that would make it easier for e cigarettes to win regulatory clearance than currently proposed by the food and drug administration. under a proposed fda rule, almost all e cigarette and vapor products introduced after feb. 15, 2007, would be required to meet regulatory standards that the industry considers excessively stringent. the house appropriations committee voted 31 19 on tuesday in favor of easing the process. the amendment was offered by republican tom cole of oklahoma and democrat sanford bishop of georgia. a vote by the full house of representatives on the spending bill has not yet been scheduled. “what happened today is a big boost of momentum for the industry,” said arnaud dumas de rauly, treasurer of the vapor technology association, which represents manufacturers and businesses. “we’re happy to have bipartisan co sponsors because up until now we only had republican buy in. now we have democratic buy in as well.” public health advocates criticized the amendment, saying it benefits industry at the expense of public health.  the 2009 tobacco control act allows a new tobacco product to be authorized for sale if it can be shown to be “substantially equivalent” to a product already on the market before february 15, 2007. if no such product exists, the new product must undergo a much more stringent review under the agency’s “premarket tobacco application” (pmta) process. the vapor industry says almost all its products would be subject to pmta review under the fda’s proposal because only one e cigarette was on the market in the united states before the grandfather date. since then, some 100,000 new e cigarette and vapor products have been introduced. moving or invalidating that grandfather date would allow some or all of the products to act as “predicates” for future products, something public health advocates say would allow e cigarettes and other tobacco products to escape a critical first step review by the fda. the american cancer society cancer action network said in a statement changing the date would “make it easier for new products to stay on the market before it is determined whether they attract youth or otherwise harm public health.”     a premarket tobacco application requires a company to prove, with scientific data, that the new product will not harm the population as a whole. so far only one company, stockholm based swedish match ab, has cleared that bar. last year the fda authorized the sale of eight of its smokeless snus products. the fda is expected soon to issue a final rule giving it authority for the first time to regulate e cigarettes and vapor products, which generated $3.3 billion in u.s. sales last year. the agency already has authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll you own tobacco. the tobacco act gave it the option of extending its authority over other tobacco products after issuing a rule.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday he had spoken with myanmar s aung san suu kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to the rohingya muslim areas in the southeast asian nation that were affected by violence. suu kyi  agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian assistance to the region, particularly by the international red cross, and she conveyed that she is working toward that end,  mcconnell said on the senate floor. mcconnell, whose republicans control majorities in both houses of congress, repeated earlier criticism of a resolution introduced in the u.s. senate urging suu kyi to do more for myanmar s ethnic minority rohingya population, and lessening the chance that any such measure could pass. mcconnell has had close ties to suu kyi for years. he said suu kyi, a nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in myanmar, also known as burma, told him when they spoke on wednesday that violations of human rights would need to be addressed. attacks by rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh. suu kyi has been a target of criticism from fellow nobel laureates and religious leaders across the world for failing to condemn human rights abuses against the rohingya during the military s fierce response to rohingya militant attacks. the united nations appealed thursday for massive help for the nearly 400,000 who fled to bangladesh, amid concern the number could keep rising unless myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing.  mcconnell said suu kyi s position in the government was  exceedingly difficult  and that as a civilian, she had virtually no authority over the military. he warned that weakening her could interfere with the country s transition from decades of military rule. mcconnell said he expected a briefing soon from suu kyi s office and that she was  trying very hard to improve conditions  for the rohingya.  burma s path to representative government is not at all certain and is certainly not over. and attacking the single political leader who has worked to further democracy within burma is likely to hinder the objective over the long run,  mcconnell concluded.

"with a growing number of muslim refugees and immigrants living in america who are strict adherents of sharia law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the united states. it is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in america, but getting caught is the hard part a petition from the womens  group equality now reveals that immigration has put the united states on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. a massive influx of immigrants from muslim-populated countries in africa and the middle east has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the u.s. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.the practice is known as female genital mutilation (fgm).the atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:it usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. in its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. a small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. the cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. it is rare for any anesthesia to be used.as the united states continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a first world country.haha dukureh, an fgm-survivor and founder of the activist organization safe hands for girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the united states go through female genital mutilation.   breitbart newsa gwinnett county muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an american prison (on the american taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. an ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the united states on monday.khalid adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.he was deported on monday after serving 10 years in prison.adem was an ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in gwinnett county, georgia in 2006.

" zimbabwe will upgrade its main airport at a cost of $153 million in an effort to attract more visitors, state media reported on thursday, as authorities renamed the airport in honor of 93 year old president robert mugabe. harare international airport will from thursday be known as robert mugabe international airport and is expected to undergo an upgrade so that it can handle 6.5 million passengers a year, more than double its current capacity. state owned herald newspaper reported that china export and import bank will provide a $153 million loan that will, among other things, be used to expand the runway to allow multiple planes to land at the same time. accepting the honor, mugabe said renaming the airport was  a great gesture  to him and his family. in the last few months, mugabe s vocal ruling zanu pf youth wing has been pushing the government to honor mugabe by giving public institutions his name. the government has said from next year the veteran ruler s  feb. 21 birthday will be known as robert mugabe national youth day, a public holiday. on aug 9. the cash strapped government announced plans to build a $1 billion university named after mugabe, a move that was criticized by the opposition as a waste of resources. mugabe is the only leader that zimbabwe has known since independence from britain in 1980 and despite his advanced age, he remains the most influential political figure in the country.

" president donald trump on wednesday moved a step closer to fulfilling his campaign promise to reform the troubled veterans affairs department, but some veterans groups are concerned that the administration may be working toward privatizing their healthcare. trump signed a law extending the pilot “veterans choice” program, which allows some veterans to receive healthcare from local doctors and hospitals closer to their homes than the va’s 150 hospitals and nearly 1,000 outpatient clinics. the law eases procedures for reimbursing private providers and creates a system for sharing medical records with them. “this new law is a good start, but there is still much work to do,” trump said at a signing ceremony attended by va secretary david shulkin and florida governor rick scott.  “we will fight each and every day to deliver the long awaited reforms our veterans deserve.” trump pledged to hold a news conference next week on “all of the tremendous things that are happening at the va and what we’ve done in terms of progress and achievement.” reforming the agency, rocked by a waiting time scandal in 2014, was one of trump’s most repeated campaign trail promises. he has frequently suggested having the government pay outside physicians to provide veteran healthcare. during his confirmation hearings, shulkin said he supported overhauling the agency but did not believe in privatizing it. still, on tuesday the va announced it was seeking cutting edge treatments from the healthcare industry for brain injuries, mental health problems and chronic pain. extension of the “veterans choice” program could worry democrats and other critics that trump and shulkin are inching toward sending some of the $65.6 billion the department spends annually on medical care to corporations and private businesses. conservatives calling for privatization say the va provides medical services to only about 45 percent of veterans, and they point to delays and inefficiencies dogging the current system.  some veterans groups and democrats have warned against moving funds away from healthcare providers with expertise in injuries and illnesses unique to serving in the armed forces. in a march report, the government accountability office said veterans in the choice program still face long wait times, mostly because cases must be referred to private contractors for scheduling.  last year a congressionally mandated panel of experts found the choice program was inefficient, but recommended establishing a community based healthcare system that would include private doctors.

" north korea’s leader kim jong un said on friday the north will consider the “highest level of hard line countermeasure in history” against the united states in response to u.s. president donald trump’s threat to destroy the north. calling trump “mentally deranged” and his comments “the most ferocious declaration of a war in history,” kim said his u.n. speech on tuesday confirmed pyongyang’s nuclear program has been “the correct path”. “his remarks ... have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path i chose is correct and that it is the one i have to follow to the last,” kim said in the statement carried by the north’s official kcna news agency, promising to make trump “pay dearly for his speech”. trump had warned the north korean leader in his u.n. address on tuesday that the united states, if threatened, would “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people and mocked kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission. it was the u.s. president’s most direct reference to military action so far against the north, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3. in addition to the nuclear test, north korea has launched dozens of missiles since kim came to power in 2011. two recent ballistic missiles flew over japan as pyongyang advanced toward its goal of creating nuclear warhead tipped missiles that can hit the united states.     kim said trump would face “results beyond his expectation,” without specifying what action north korea would take next. “i will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotard with fire,” kim said in the rare direct statement, referring to trump. he offered more vitriol for trump, saying he was “unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician.” a day after trump’s address, north korea’s foreign minister ri yong ho had likened trump to a “barking dog,” saying his comments were no threat to the north. kim took a page out of ri’s book on friday, saying “a frightened dog barks louder”. “now that trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world.., we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard line countermeasure in history,” kim said.

" tensions between the united states and russia will not “spiral out of control” following last week’s u.s. cruise missile strikes on a syrian air base, defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday, describing it as a one off response to syria’s use of banned chemical weapons. president donald trump, in his biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in january, ordered the strikes after concluding that syria waged a nerve gas attack in rebel held territory that killed 87 people, many of them children.  russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding syrian president bashar al assad, warned the u.s. strike could have serious consequences. syria denies involvement. “it will not spiral out of control,” mattis told reporters at the pentagon. “i’m confident the russians will act in their own best interest and there is nothing in their best interest to say they want this situation to go out of control.” mattis has repeatedly warned that the u.s. military remained ready to act again should assad use chemical weapons, saying on tuesday that assad would “pay a very, very stiff price.”    at the same time, he acknowledged that trump had only authorized the single attack, meaning the u.s. military would not automatically have the authority to strike again should washington determine another case of chemical weapons use. mattis also sought to downplay concerns about pentagon mission creep, saying the u.s. military’s focus in syria was still fighting islamic state militants, not becoming entangled in syria’s messy civil war between assad and his opponents. “the rest of the campaign stays on track exactly as it was before assad’s violation,” mattis said. the incident has chilled u.s. relations with moscow after a presidential campaign during which trump frequently called for an alliance with russia to fight islamic state militants in syria and iraq. it has also led the trump administration to harden its attitude against assad weeks after top u.s. officials said they were more concerned with defeating islamic state militants than getting assad out of power. “i don’t see a peaceful, stable syria in the future that has assad in charge,” white house spokesman sean spicer said on tuesday. “i don’t see a future syria that has (assad) as the leader of that government.” u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson denounced russian support for assad as he prepared to fly to moscow on tuesday. “it is clear to us the reign of the assad family is coming to an end,” tillerson told reporters in italy. u.s. intelligence indicates that syrian su 22 aircraft taking off from shayrat airfield delivered the nerve agent sarin, according to a white house report given to reporters. mattis said there was no doubt that damascus was responsible. although some u.s. officials have strongly hinted they suspect russia, which has a presence at shayrat, may have known something about the planned attack, none have conclusively linked moscow to the incident itself. mattis suggested the united states did not have firm evidence that russia had foreknowledge or was complicit in the chemical attack. “it was very clear that the assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it and beyond that we can’t say right now. we know what i just told you, we don’t know anything beyond that,” mattis said, when asked whether russia had a role.

" defense secretary jim mattis said on wednesday that the military was looking into what changes, if any, should be made after an ambush in niger killed four u.s. soldiers last week. the incident, which u.s. officials suspect was carried out by a local islamic state affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the u.s. counterterrorism mission in the west african country. mattis, addressing the incident for the first time publicly, said the ambush had taken place in an area where  the enemy has not operated before  and that the patrol had been  hit hard.   he said french aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes and that he did not believe there was a delay in evacuating those wounded and killed, although he did not say how long it took to move them.  we will look at this and say was there something we have to adapt to now, should we have been in a better stance, you know, autopsy, you always find a lot out in them,  mattis told reporters on board a military plane.  we re not complacent, we re going to do better,  he added.  from initial accounts, the 40 member patrol, which included about a dozen u.s. troops, came under a swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. at least four nigeriens were also killed and, according to one niger security source, militants seized four vehicles in the ambush. a diplomat with knowledge of the incident said french officials were frustrated by the u.s. troops  actions, saying they had acted on only limited intelligence and without contingency plans in place. u.s. forces do not have a direct combat mission in niger, but their assistance to its army includes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations.

" president donald trump’s vow to “send in the feds” if chicago is unable to cut shootings and killings is a pledge to provide law enforcement or other federal assistance so that the city’s citizens will feel safe, the white house said on wednesday. “we’ll hopefully get a dialogue started with mayor (rahm) emanuel to try to figure out what a path forward can be so that we come up with a plan that can keep the people of chicago safe,” said white house spokesman sean spicer. emanuel told reporters that he has always welcomed federal help in chicago and he would like to see the city’s partnership with federal law enforcement agencies like the federal bureau of investigation and the drug enforcement agency enhanced and strengthened.  “chicago, like other cities right now that are dealing with gun violence, want the partnerships with federal law enforcement agencies in a more significant way,” emanuel said.  emanuel added that he was opposed to deployment of the national guard, which he said would be counterproductive to reinvigorating community policing in the city, calling it “antithetical” to these efforts.   “the national guard has nothing to do with public safety,” he said. the mayor, who noted chicago is not alone in seeing spiking crime rates, said the problem must also be addressed with programs for after school activities, summer jobs, and mentoring, as well the “certainty of sentencing” at the state and federal levels for gun crimes. last year, the midwest city of 2.7 million saw a surge of violence with 762 murders, an uptick of 57 percent from the previous year.  the mayor and police superintendent eddie johnson have said that those who commit shootings do not fear the repercussions due to lax sentences for gun offenders.    trump has periodically cited chicago’s violence as an example of rising inner city crime. urban violence, drug trafficking and poverty were recurring themes in trump’s campaign appearances.

" puerto rico’s bankruptcy, aimed at restructuring $72 billion of debt, violates the u.s. constitution and should be dismissed, the aurelius capital management hedge fund said in a court filing on monday. the u.s. commonwealth’s federally appointed oversight board initiated its debt cutting proceeding in may under a law known as promesa. puerto rico is barred from traditional municipal bankruptcy protection under chapter 9 of the u.s. code. affiliates of aurelius argued in court papers that the creation of the oversight board violated the u.s. constitution’s appointments clause. aurelius said board members answer only to the u.s. president, yet their appointments were never confirmed by the senate. six of seven members were essentially hand picked by congress, violating the principle of the separation of powers, the hedge fund said. the fund, known for its years long battle with argentina over its defaulted debt, seeks to bar the oversight board from operating until it has been validly constituted.  aurelius holds roughly $468 million worth of debt guaranteed by puerto rico’s constitution. the hedge fund, run by mark brodsky, is known for buying distressed debt and pursuing aggressive litigation tactics to boost recoveries. in the argentina case, the fund participated in numerous legal actions, including an unsuccessful attempt to attach argentine pension and retirement funds located in u.s. banks. the firm was one of many parties that settled with argentina in 2016. creditors were among those who lobbied most aggressively for the appointment of a board in puerto rico, believing it would support investor friendly policies. but the board has lost allies in the creditor community after it sought to impose severe losses on creditors even as it has also pushed puerto rico to impose austerity measures.  puerto rico, with $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and near insolvent public health and pension systems, filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history in may. it was the board that technically filed the bankruptcy, under the 2016 puerto rico rescue law known as promesa. the law allows the board to essentially step into the puerto rico government’s shoes for purposes of debt restructuring.

" the u.s. house committee on natural resources said it will work to identify red tape and other bureaucratic hurdles to speed up puerto rico’s recovery and rebuilding, as the island struggles to recover from the impact of hurricane maria. committee chairman rob bishop said in a press call on wednesday that the federal emergency management agency (fema) and other federal partners will also likely be engaged for years in helping puerto rico get back on its feet. bishop added that an emergency response will be executed through fema and local officials. “an emergency funding package is taking place as we speak to support those efforts,” he said. on tuesday a white house official told reuters the white house was preparing a $29 billion disaster aid request to be sent to congress after hurricanes hit puerto rico, texas and florida. the request was expected to come on wednesday. it will combine nearly $13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims with $16 billion for the government backed flood insurance program.  bishop said under evaluation was also the question of whether to modify or give additional power to the oversight board tasked with overseeing puerto rico’s debt restructuring. puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands were battered by hurricanes irma and maria. hurricane maria knocked out power to puerto rico’s 3.4 million residents last month, devastating the island’s already dilapidated electric power infrastructure. following a closed door meeting of the committee, puerto rico’s republican delegate, jenniffer gonzalez, told reporters there are ongoing discussions among members of congress, white house aides and the treasury department over a possible short term loan to puerto rico, which she said will face a liquidity crisis in november.  she said it was unclear whether trump might be able to issue an executive order, if he so desired, to provide quick financial help or whether congress would have to act. representative raul grijalva, the senior democrat on the panel, said of promesa after the meeting: “i said let’s open it up and see what is working and see what is not applicable in this situation, what we need to suspend.” promesa is the federal 2016 rescue law under which puerto rico in may filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history.

" a french it company that supplied the electronic system used in kenya s nullified election last month has told the election commission its technology will not be ready to use again by the oct. 17 date set for a re run of the vote. the statement presents a hurdle for the commission. it could threaten the timing of the election that president uhuru kenyatta, whose win on aug. 8 win was canceled by the supreme court, will contest against opposition leader raila odinga. when the supreme court nullified the results of the presidential election citing irregularities, it ordered a new poll within 60 days. the commission then declared oct. 17 as the date for the re run. in a letter from paris based ot morpho to the election commission, the company said the two electronic systems it supplied for the vote would have to be reinstalled for the re run.  this represents a very significant amount of work, which cannot be secured by october 17,  said the letter dated sept. 18 and seen by reuters. ot morpho provided 45,000 tablets for identifying voters using biometric technology and the system used to transmit results counted at polling stations as well as a photograph of the paper sheet from each station. delays in transmission of the tally sheets was an irregularity raised by the opposition in its petition to the supreme court. the court has not released its full verdict but has said it will do so by thursday. a spokesman for the company confirmed the letter was accurate. andrew limo, a spokesman for the election board, said he was aware of the letter and the board met on monday to discuss it. earlier in the day, he told reuters that  changing the date (of the election re run) is a last resort strategy.  the date of the new poll has been a source of tension between kenyatta and odinga. kenyatta and his ruling jubilee party have said the re run should be held on oct. 17 as scheduled by the commission, while the opposition is threatening to boycott the new poll if its demands for the sacking of key election officials are not met.

" south carolina governor nikki haley has written to u.s. energy secretary ernest moniz demanding a shipment of weapons grade plutonium en route to her state from japan be turned back or sent elsewhere, according to a copy of the letter seen by reuters. the demand has the potential to embarrass the obama administration a week before it hosts an important summit on nuclear non proliferation and undermine what so far has been viewed as a success in keeping weapons grade material safe. the ship loaded with weapons grade plutonium left japan for a department of energy site in south carolina on tuesday in what is the largest such shipment of the highly dangerous material since 1992, the environmental group greenpeace said.  the shipment “puts south carolina at risk for becoming a permanent dumping ground for nuclear materials,” haley said in the letter dated march 23. “therefore, stop shipment or re route this defense plutonium. god bless.”   a representative for the u.s. department of energy said it is reviewing haley’s letter but cannot comment on matters under active litigation. the state has sued the department over the federal government’s plans to scrap a plutonium recycling plant that has been under construction for years in the state. the dispute comes as washington prepares to host the nuclear security summit march 31 to april 1.  the plutonium being shipped was supplied by the united states, britain and france for the government owned japan atomic energy agency’s fast critical assembly research project in tokai mura, according to the international panel on fissile materials. the agreement to transfer the material to the united states was reached in march 2014 at a previous non proliferation summit, the panel said on its website.  a south carolina based environmental advocacy group said the shipment “only exacerbates the plutonium storage and disposition problems at” the department’s savannah river site, a 310 square mile (500 square kilometers) area bordered by the savannah river and georgia. “the u.s. government has done a poor job of explaining why this material is being taken to srs,” tom clements, director of srs watch, said in a statement.    the 331 kilograms (730 pounds) on board the british owned pacific egret is only a tiny proportion of the nearly 50 tonnes  (55 tons) of plutonium held by japan. japan wants to use the plutonium extracted from spent fuel in nuclear plants as fuel for modified reactors. but with nearly all the country’s units still shut down in the wake of the fukushima nuclear disaster five years ago and no schedule for further restarts there is little use for the material. only a few reactors can take plutonium as fuel. a homegrown reprocessing plant being built in northern japan, which has relied on the british and french to extract plutonium from spent uranium fuel rods, also has the potential to add to the stockpile, although its start has been repeatedly delayed. the plutonium being shipped, enough to make about 50 nuclear weapons, was taken from the nuclear research center in the port town of tokai mura near tokyo, for transport to south carolina. the website www.vesselfinder.com said the ship is a nuclear fuel carrier.     shipments of plutonium are highly sensitive because it can be used in nuclear weapons or to make a so called dirty bomb. in japan, public sensitivity is also high because it is the only country that has been attacked with nuclear bombs. japan is also the only nation without atomic weapons with significant amounts of plutonium, which has led to constant criticism from neighboring countries, scientists and others.      china, a nuclear weapons state, this week said japan should abide by its non proliferation obligations. “japan is still stockpiling a large amount of other sensitive nuclear materials, including separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium. this certainly is an issue for the international community to be concerned about,” chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said on tuesday.      thomas countryman, an assistant u.s. secretary of state in charge of non proliferation, has called into question the renewal of an agreement between washington and tokyo that allows japan to reprocess and produce weapons grade plutonium.  the agreement is due to be extended in 2018, but with a new u.s. administration starting in january its status is unclear. “we think that there are genuine economic questions where it’s important that the u.s. and its partners in asia have a common understanding of the economic and non proliferation issues at stake before making a decision about renewal of the 1 2 3 agreement, for example, with japan,” countryman told a senate hearing last week.

" donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital will hasten the country s destruction, iran s defense minister said on monday, while a top revolutionary guards commander phoned two palestinian armed groups and pledged support for them. leaders of iran, where opposition to israel and support for the palestinian cause has been central to foreign policy since the 1979 islamic revolution, have denounced last week s announcement by the u.s. president, including a plan to move the u.s. embassy to the city. the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state.  (trump s) step will hasten the destruction of the zionist regime and will double the unity of muslims,  iran s defense minister, brigadier general amir hatami, said on monday, according to state media. the army s chief of staff, general mohammad baqeri, said trump s  foolish move  could be seen as the beginning of a new intifada, or palestinian uprising. iran has long supported a number of anti israeli militant groups, including the military wing of lebanon based hezbollah, which the deputy commander of iran s elite revolutionary guards, brigadier general hossein salami, said was  stronger than the zionist regime.  similarly, qassem soleimani, the head of the branch of the guards that oversees operations outside of iran s borders pledged the islamic republic s  complete support for palestinian islamic resistance movements  after phone calls with commanders from islamic jihad and the izz al deen qassam brigades, the armed wing of the hamas movement, on monday according to sepah news, the news site of the guards. palestinian president mahmoud abbas on monday stepped up efforts to rally middle eastern countries against u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital, which eu foreign ministers meanwhile declined to support.

" poland s parliament has passed a bill that gives the government, rather than a panel of top judges, control over who conducts elections, a move the opposition called  satanic . minutes before midnight on thursday, lawmakers of the right wing law and justice (pis) party and their allies approved a bill that allows the interior minister to nominate all candidates for head of the national election bureau. the pis has said its bill will make voting more transparent, but critics have said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has denied european commission accusations of eroding democratic standards. the head of the judges  panel, the state electoral commission (pkw), said the bill would undermine the electoral process.  de facto, the minister will take decisions, not us,  pkw head wojciech hermelinski told reporters on friday. poland is already at risk of sanctions from the eu over a pis judicial reform; prime minister mateusz morawiecki said on thursday he expected the european commission to launch an unprecedented punishment procedure against warsaw next week.    hermelinski said germany had a functioning system where government officials organized elections, but that the polish government should not leave the independent pkw in place as a  camouflage  without real powers. according to the bill, if none of the minister s candidates meet with the judges  approval, the minister can simply appoint the head of the election bureau.   lawmaker jacek protas from the opposition civic platform said in parliament that the bill was a  satanic idea  that would give a controlling stake in democracy to a single political party. the pkw head said he would speak to members of the pis dominated upper house, the senate, and president andrzej duda to urge them to prevent the measures passing into law. the changes will also require the pkw to appoint about 100 lower ranking election officials from lists of candidates presented by the interior minister. those candidates will no longer have to be judges themselves and, as with the head of the bureau, if the pkw rejects all the names put forward, the minister will have the power to impose a choice. the pis dominated senate is set on thursday to approve the overhaul of the judiciary   the deepest since poland s transition from communism nearly three decades ago   which the opposition says violates the constitution.

" illinois’ first budget after two years is filled with partial outlines to address its debt ridden pension system and unpaid bill backlog — signs that political fighting and the fiscal mess in the nation’s fifth largest state are far from over. at least 15 house and senate republicans broke with first term republican governor bruce rauner on thursday and joined with democrats to override rauner’s vetoes of the state’s first budget package in more than two years.  the $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. to address the state’s nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, illinois depends heavily on borrowing. lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12 year bonds to raise money for repayments. but state representative greg harris, the house democrats’ point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while “sweeping” cash from other accounts —a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  illinois’ $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of illinois’ five retirement systems.  the new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund’s actuarial calculations. last year, when the illinois teachers’ retirement system reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state’s fiscal 2018 contribution. the new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. but that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. that estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by rauner earlier this year. the projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and rauner’s office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  the illinois education association, one of the state’s largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget’s pension provisions. but the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.  “it’s a little bit of a shot in the dark. for something this major, you’d think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,” said jim reed, the union’s government relations director. a budget was welcomed as a positive step for illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises. “the pension pressures will continue, and illinois’ financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there’s a limit to the liability growth to this state,” said laurence msall, president of the civic federation, a budget watchdog group. steve malanga, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by illinois. “this is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,” he said. “it’s not the kind of budget you’d pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability.” the democrats and republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent illinois from becoming the first u.s. state in history to see its credit rating fall to “junk” status. moody’s on wednesday put illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state’s bonds traded higher on friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.       ",0

" u.s. officials held a roundtable discussion at the white house on tuesday about the “worsening” fiscal crisis in puerto rico, as the obama administration continues to press congress to act on the issue. the meeting with puerto rican labor leaders and business executives featured briefings from treasury secretary jacob lew and secretary of health and human services sylvia burwell, according to a white house blog post issued late on tuesday. lew told meeting participants that puerto rico has already had to take extreme emergency measures like borrowing from its pensions to stay afloat and the island will face additional strain in may and june, when more than $2 billion in debt payments come due. “we simply cannot provide puerto rico with the tools it desperately needs to confront this crisis without congressional action,” the white house said. the white house has said that puerto rico needs federal legislation to allow it to restructure its debts and give it independent fiscal oversight.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday reinstated a global gag rule that bans u.s. funded groups around the world from discussing abortion, a move that was widely expected but nonetheless dismayed women’s rights advocates. the rule, which affects american non governmental organizations working abroad, is one that incoming presidents have used to signal their positions on abortion rights. it was created under u.s. president ronald reagan in 1984. trump, an abortion opponent, signed the reinstatement directive at a ceremony in the white house on his fourth day in office. former president barack obama had lifted the gag rule in 2009 when he took office. “women’s health and rights are now one of the first casualties of the trump administration,” said serra sippel, president of the center for health and gender equity in washington. “the global gag rule has been associated with an increase in unsafe abortions and we expect that trump’s global gag rule will cost women their lives,” she said. reinstatement of the gag rule, formally the mexico city policy, comes just two days after crowds of people marched in cities around the world in a show of unity for women’s rights, among them abortion access. while no official estimates were available, organizers said nearly five million people participated. the far reaching gag rule affects groups getting funding from the u.s. agency for international development, even if they use separate money for abortion services, counseling or referrals, advocates note. “it is appalling to dictate to civil society groups and health care providers how they can spend their own money and force them to withhold from women critical information about and access to the full range of reproductive health care,” said nancy northup, president of the u.s. based center for reproductive rights. the policy puts groups that provide women’s health care in an “untenable position,” said brian dixon of population connection action fund. they can either accept the restriction to keep their funding or they can reject the restriction and lose their funding, dixon said. “either choice hurts the women that rely on them.”  following the rule’s inception in 1984, former president bill clinton revoked it when he took office in 1993 and former president george w. bush reinstated it in 2001. “life saving global health funding should not be a political football,” said ann starrs, head of the guttmacher institute, a leading reproductive rights group.  there is no evidence the rule reduces abortion, she said. “in fact, by targeting funding for overseas family planning programs, it may well have the opposite effect by making it harder for many women to avoid unintended pregnancy, which in turn would increase recourse to unsafe procedures by women who cannot access safe abortion care,” she said.

" president donald trump on tuesday reaffirmed support for the united states’ longstanding security alliances around the world but insisted that friends and partners from europe to the middle east to the pacific must “pay their fair share of the cost.” in his first nationally televised speech to congress since taking office on jan. 20, trump sought to reassure allies still uneasy over doubts he raised during the 2016 presidential campaign about his commitment to their defense and to maintaining a u.s. global leadership role. but he also made clear that he expects those countries to shoulder more of the burden of their own security needs, echoing a campaign message that some allies had taken advantage of washington’s generosity in providing them a security umbrella. “our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world,” trump told a joint session of congress. “it is american leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.” he specifically assured nato allies of his new administration’s continued commitment to the decades old alliance. however, he made no mention of one of the main sources of european concern: his friendly overtures during the campaign toward russian president vladimir putin. “we strongly support nato, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism and a cold war that defeated communism,” trump said. “but our partners must meet their financial obligations,” he said. “and now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.” then, deviating from his prepared remarks, trump added: “in fact, i can tell you the money is pouring in. very nice.” but he offered no specifics. some critics had accused trump of failing to recognize the benefit that accrued to the united states of having strong democratic allies helping to stabilize volatile areas like the middle east, ukraine and south asia. trump’s remarks followed the deployment earlier this month of senior cabinet members to brussels, bonn and munich, germany, aimed at calming european worries. the europeans heard from defense secretary james mattis that the north atlantic treaty organization military alliance was not “obsolete” after all, despite trump’s suggestions to the contrary. vice president mike pence told them that russia would be “held accountable” for its actions in ukraine.  mattis made his first foreign trip to south korea and japan, where he sought to ease  concerns about what trump’s self styled “america first” strategy means for u.s. foreign policy in asia. while seeming to tackle some of the doubts of u.s. allies, trump still made clear that he wanted them to do more. “we expect our partners, whether in nato, in the middle east, or the pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost,” he said.

" donald trump’s promise to gut u.s. environmental regulations and revive the controversial keystone xl oil pipeline if elected president is a nightmare for green groups, but it may be a dream come true for their fund raisers. the country’s biggest environmental groups say the republican white house hopeful’s pro drilling and anti global warming positions have sparked a record wave of donations and volunteer recruitment that could revitalize u.s. green advocacy. trump has said he would revive the coal industry, pull the united states out of a global climate pact and expand oil drilling.  “we couldn’t have asked for a more powerful motivator than donald trump,” sierra club executive director michael brune said. brune said a spring email blast about the new york businessman to the san francisco based group’s members yielded $25,000 in donations, more than twice as much as projected, along with 15,000 new volunteers. the club’s political committee, which works directly on projects to engage voters during the election, has raised more than $62,000 this year, compared with just $22,000 at this point in the 2012 election, according to the filings with the federal election commission.     the washington based league of conservation voters has also gotten a boost. officials said its annual fund raising dinner this week pulled in a record haul, which they would not disclose, after the group also used trump as a focal point of its donor outreach. “it’s been a long time since there has been someone that our movement has so universally wanted to stop,” said spokesman david willett.  the league’s voters action fund, meanwhile, has raised more than $610,000 in donations so far this year for election related work, more than triple what it pulled in during the same period of 2012, and more than double that of 2008, according to federal filings. trump has long signaled his belief that global warming is a hoax. last month he outlined plans to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by the obama administration, scrap the paris climate accord, and revive the keystone xl   moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. a spokeswoman for trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. nextgen climate, a san francisco based environmental advocacy organization founded by billionaire activist tom steyer, has called trump’s agenda “frightening.” but its efforts were also getting some traction from the candidate’s rhetoric.  the group, which has featured trump in its tv ads to drive voter turnout, said it had seen a 127 percent increase in clicks on its social media postings that mention the candidate compared with those that do not. “there is no question that voters are very engaged when it comes to fighting back against trump,” said nextgen spokeswoman suzanne henkels. ben avery, associate fund raising director of the sierra club’s northwest chapter, said he was happy about the increase in donor support this year but was vexed by the reason behind it. “bad news is good news for fund raising,” he said.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump offered fresh details of how he would tackle illegal immigration on saturday, saying he would crack down on those who overstay their visas as he sought to quiet criticism from conservatives. in a campaign speech in des moines, iowa, trump also cited the shooting death of a cousin of nba star dwyane wade to urge african american voters to rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that has to be addressed. trump, speaking on the iowa state fairgrounds with hay bales stacked behind him, sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the u.s. immigration system after saying earlier in the week that he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. that stance drew fire from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the republican presidential nomination in large part by a hardline stance that would include building a wall along the u.s. border with mexico. in his speech, trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e verify system to prevent the illegal community from gaining access to welfare and other benefits. “if we don’t enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border – it’s as simple as that,” he said. in outlining his views, trump said addressing illegal immigration is important to helping americans find jobs. “every time an african american citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that american citizen have been violated,” he said. “equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws.” trump said his first priority upon taking office next january would be the immediate deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants who remain in the united states despite having committed crimes. “these international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. their reign of terror will be over. in this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the american people – we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent american has been harmed or killed before taking action,” he said. he did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the united states for decades and obeyed u.s. laws. trump said the death in chicago of wade cousin nykea aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in u.s. inner cities. chicago mayor rahm emanuel, a former chief of staff to democratic president barack obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city. the incident permitted trump to bring up again his desire to be a “law and order” president and underscore his drive to appeal to african american voters who traditionally vote democratic and overwhelmingly support democratic rival hillary clinton. “it breaks all of our hearts to see it, it’s horrible,” trump said. “and it’s only getting worse. this shouldn’t happen in our country. this shouldn’t happen in america. we send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.” trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes. the new york businessman was the headline speaker at “joni ernst’s roast and ride,” a charity event for military veterans run by u.s. senator joni ernst, a republican. ernst and most other speakers offered praise for trump, a rarity at a time when many republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric. trump is running neck and neck with clinton in polls in the state with 72 days until the nov. 8 election.

" the u.s. tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable, according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by reuters, with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it. a decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off u.s. home values and led to a deep global recession, the housing market has bounced back smartly. u.s. house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages. that is in sharp contrast to the outlook for britain. [gb/homes] the s&p/case shiller composite index of u.s. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 5.1 percent next year and 4.2 percent in 2019. the main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes, which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers, who tend to be young and not particularly well paid and, if university educated, already saddled with huge amounts of debt. now adding to those concerns is an effort by president donald trump’s administration to overhaul the tax code, which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market. the republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million. the house of representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on tuesday afternoon, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said his chamber would vote on tuesday evening. twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive. eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability. “losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes   of having deductibility limited   makes housing less attractive and less affordable,” said robert brusca, chief economist at fao economics. but he added: “the trump/congress plan is such a not well thought out mess it’s hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way.” asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. while the latest consensus on u.s. housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling, the range of forecasts has narrowed. “we think there’s a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth, housing affordability could take a turn for the worse,” noted ralph mclaughlin, economist at trulia in san francisco.  “this is because the housing market has a supply, not a demand problem, so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are.” another challenge has been lingering for years. while the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17 year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not broken above 2.9 percent since the great recession that ended about eight years ago. “home prices have been appreciating circa 5 6 percent well above wage growth at 2 2.5 percent, decreasing affordability for the average buyer, particularly first time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities,” said lindsey piegza, chief economist at stifel in chicago. she also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable.  the latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis. existing home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.48 million units in october, but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005.  property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5.5 5.6 million, less than the 5.70 million unit pace hit in march, which was the highest since february 2007.  those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a reuters poll in august. but data on monday showed u.s. single family homebuilding and permits rose in november to a level not seen since august 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 18 1/2 year high in december, in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints. the u.s. federal reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year. while lifting short term rates won’t necessarily push up longer term market rates, the path of least resistance is higher. still, the latest reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in august. the 30 year mortgage rate is expected to average 4.24 percent next year, rising to 4.65 percent in 2019 and 5.00 percent in 2020. analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the fed would significantly slow activity.  “if there are more than three hikes, it is likely that the fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up – and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates,” said david berson, chief economist at nationwide insurance in columbus, ohio.

" iran said on friday it had barred a u.s. wrestling team from the freestyle world cup competition in retaliation for an executive order by president donald trump banning visas for iranians, state television reported. the freestyle world cup, one of the sport’s most prestigious events, is scheduled for feb. 16 17 and usa wrestling had previously said it would send a team to the competition in the western iranian city of kermanshah. tehran has already announced it will stop u.s. citizens entering the country following washington’s decision to ban refugees and citizens of seven majority muslim countries including iran. “a special committee in tehran reviewed their cases and decided to oppose the visit by the u.s. freestyle wrestling team,” foreign ministry spokesman bahram ghasemi was quoted by state television as saying. “the visa policy of the new american administration gave us no other option but to ban the wrestlers.” usa wrestling said that neither they nor united world wrestling have been officially notified that these reports are accurate. “we have no official documentation that the usa wrestling team will be denied the opportunity to participate at the freestyle world cup,” usa wrestling said in a statement. “the freestyle world cup is the annual world dual meet championship, one of the most important events that united world wrestling hosts each year. “if these reports are true, usa wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. wrestling is about competition and goodwill through sport, and is no place for politics.” usa wrestling said on monday the united states would send a team to iran, where u.s. freestyle wrestlers have participated in competitions since 1998.  nenad lalovic, president of united world wrestling, the sport’s international federation, said it was working towards a solution. “though we had hoped for a different outcome from iran’s foreign ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. we are currently working to find a solution for the freestyle world cup as soon as possible,” he said in a statement. “despite the travel restrictions between their countries i’ve been encouraged this week by the cooperation and friendship of the iranian wrestling federation and usa wrestling. “as we’ve seen over the years, wrestling is a sport that unites people and nations. united world wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season and we’re certain to see american and iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future.” trump has adopted an aggressive stance towards tehran since iran’s ballistic missile test launch, saying it was now “on notice”. the new u.s. administration is expected to impose fresh sanctions on multiple iranian entities.

" a group of 22 members of the u.s. house of representatives asked the environmental protection agency in a letter on thursday not to lower some requirements for mixing biofuels into the country’s fuel supply, but also not to let ethanol exports qualify for renewable fuel credits, according to a copy of the letter obtained by reuters. the members of congress are part of a bipartisan voting bloc dedicated to supporting the biofuels industry called the house biofuels caucus. they represent districts in states such as iowa and illinois where farmers grow corn for ethanol and other biofuels. they urged the agency to increase biomass based biodiesel requirements and not to decrease the amount of advanced biofuels required to be added to the fuel supply.  “our farmers and biofuels producers need greater certainty from the epa,” the letter said, adding recent proposals the agency said it was considering “create unnecessary angst.”  “we will respond to the house biofuels caucus through the proper channel,” said epa spokesman jahan wilcox in an email to reuters. midwestern politicians and industry representatives have been pressuring the epa not to reduce renewable fuel standards.  fuel companies, meanwhile, want to change certain rules for complying with the standards to make it easier and cheaper for them to meet their renewable fuel requirements. they want ethanol exports to count as tradable credits toward their renewable fuel requirements, a proposal the biofuels caucus members condemned. “this proposition would upend infrastructure investments needed to blend ethanol into our fuel supply and pick winners and losers in a manner inconsistent with the congressional intent of the renewable fuel standard,” they wrote.  iowa’s governor kim reynolds said that president donald trump told her on a phone call on wednesday that he was committed to renewable fuels, though advocates say they won’t be satisfied until the epa reverses recent steps it has taken to lower renewable fuel requirements.   last month, the epa said it was looking to cut 2018 biodiesel blending requirements, roiling markets and drawing criticism from the country’s farm belt. in july, it proposed cutting total volumes of all renewable fuels use for next year.

" u.s. federal communications commission chairman tom wheeler plans to step down on jan. 20, he said on thursday, a move expected to hand republicans a 2 1 majority on the panel when donald trump takes office as president. wheeler could have kept the commission at 2 2 until trump names a new member who needs to be confirmed by the senate. last week, two republican fcc commissioners said the trump administration should quickly reverse many significant policies set by the telecommunications and cable regulatory body under democratic president barack obama. unless the u.s. senate reconfirms democratic commissioner jessica rosenworcel, she will have to leave at end of the month. senate democrats on thursday held out the possibility that republicans could put her back on the fcc next year. with the departures of wheeler and rosenworcel, the only remaining democrat on the panel would be mignon clyburn, whose term does not expire until june 2017. trump will get to select the next chairman.  wheeler, a former cable tv and mobile phone industry lobbyist, repeatedly clashed with companies during his tenure at the fcc, especially over the 2015 order to reclassify broadband internet service providers under a section of communications law that treats them more like public utilities and subjects them to stricter regulation as part of the commission’s “net neutrality” rules. the rules bar broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the information superhighway, to certain services over others. commissioner ajit pai, a republican, said last week he believed the net neutrality rules’ “days are numbered.” he also said he hoped the commission would eliminate many regulations and propose fewer actions. wheeler also scrutinized a series of proposed mergers, demanding significant conditions to some and rejecting others. in 2015, wheeler blocked comcast corp’s proposed $45 billion acquisition of time warner cable and said the fcc had serious concerns about allowing a tie up of sprint corp and t mobile us.    republican commissioner mike o’rielly said last week that the fcc under trump needed to “undo the more harmful policies adopted by the current commission.”   o’rielly criticized the fcc’s decision in october to impose stricter privacy rules on internet service providers than on websites like facebook inc or twitter inc.   last month wheeler dropped plans to push through a proposed reform of the $45 billion business data services market. he also dropped a plan to allow pay tv subscribers to ditch their set top boxes. former fcc chairman julius genachowski, a partner at carlyle group lp, said wheeler “fought relentlessly for broadband, competition and consumers, and our country’s innovation economy today is strong and world leading.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump’s administration is preparing to ignore any rulings by the world trade organization that it sees as an affront to u.s. sovereignty, the financial times reported on tuesday, citing a report prepared by officials. the draft document, due to be sent to the u.s. congress on wednesday, marks the first time the new administration has laid out its trade plans in writing, the times said. “ever since the united states won its independence, it has been a basic principle of our country that american citizens are subject only to laws and regulations made by the u.s. government — not rulings made by foreign governments or international bodies,” the report said, according to the times. “accordingly, the trump administration will aggressively defend american sovereignty over matters of trade policy,” the report said, according to the times. the wall street journal, which also said it reviewed the  document, said the policy represents a dramatic departure from the obama administration, which emphasized international economic rules and the authority of the wto, a body that regulates trade and resolves disputes among its members. by contrast, the trump administration will more assertively defend u.s. sovereignty over trade policy, ramp up enforcement of u.s. trade laws, and use “all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open up their markets,” the document said, according to the journal. the white house did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.  congress requires the president to submit the administration’s trade policy annually by march 1. in the face of republican concerns, a congressional aide said language in the draft challenging the wto could still be toned down in a final, public version, the journal reported. washington is facing several important wto decisions, particularly involving china. potentially the most important is a wto complaint filed in december by beijing against the eu and the united states for blocking china’s request to be treated as a “market economy” under the institution’s rules. a final ruling could still be years away. but were the u.s. to ignore a finding in china’s favor it could have major consequences for the wto as a venue for resolving trade disputes before they fester into destructive trade wars, the times said.  ",0

" north korea and the united states accused each other on tuesday of posing a nuclear threat, with pyongyang s envoy declaring it would never put its atomic arsenal up for negotiation. the debate at the united nations began when the u.s. envoy said president donald trump s top priority was to protect the united states and its allies against the  growing threat  from north korea. to do so, he said, the country was ready to use  the full range of capabilities at our disposal . u.s. ambassador robert wood told the conference on disarmament that the  path to dialogue still remains an option  for pyongyang, but that washington was  undeterred in defending against the threat north korea poses . fears have grown over north korea s development of missiles and nuclear weapons since pyongyang test launched intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) in july. those fears worsened after trump warned that north korea would face  fire and fury  if it threatened the united states. his remarks led north korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the u.s. pacific territory of guam. trump responded by tweeting that the u.s. military was  locked and loaded, should north korea act unwisely . a few days later, north korean media reported the country s leader, kim jong un, had delayed any decision on whether to fire missiles towards guam while he waited to see what the united states would do. experts warned pyongyang could still go ahead with the missile launches.      north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs pose grave threats to the entire world,  wood told the geneva forum.  its recent icbm tests are another example of the dangerous reckless behavior of the north that is destabilizing the region and beyond.  north korea had openly stated that its missiles are intended to strike cities in the united states and its allies south korea and japan, he said.  my president s top priority remains protecting the homeland, u.s. territories and our allies against north korean aggression. we remain prepared to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against the growing threat from north korea.  north korea diplomat ju yong chol said that measures taken by his country to strengthen its nuclear deterrent and develop inter continental rockets were  justifiable and a legitimate option .  as long as the u.s. hostile policy and nuclear threat remains unchallenged, the dprk will never place its self defensive nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table or step back an inch from the path it took to bolster the national nuclear force,  ju said. in a subsequent speech, ju said:  the united states should clearly understand that military threats and pressure are only serving as a momentum that pushes the dprk further into developing fully strengthened nuclear deterrence.  regarding joint u.s. south korean military exercises that began on monday, he said:  the ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.  china s disarmament ambassador, fu cong, called for support for its proposal to defuse the crisis affecting its pyongyang ally.  china has called for  dual suspension , that is of north korea s nuclear activities and joint military exercises between the republic of korea and united states. this seeks to denuclearize the peninsula and promote a security mechanism.  wood rejected beijing s  freeze for freeze  plan.  this proposal unfortunately creates a false equivalency between states that are engaging in legitimate exercises of self defense who have done so for many years with a regime that has basically violated countless security council resolutions with regard to its proscribed nuclear and ballistic missile programs,  he told the gathering.  that is a false equivalency that we cannot accept and will not accept,  he said. fu retorted:  i just want to say that we re not creating equivalency between anything. we are just actually making the proposal to facilitate a dialogue and to reduce the tension. we need a starting point to really launch the dialogue.

" the u.s. senate moved on tuesday toward ramming through approval of president donald trump’s supreme court nominee this week, as its top republican said he had the votes to wipe away democratic roadblocks but vowed to preserve the minority party’s ability to hold up legislation. majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to change the senate’s long standing rules in order to eliminate the ability to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster against supreme court nominees like trump’s pick, neil gorsuch, if a democratic filibuster succeeds as expected in blocking a confirmation vote. senate confirmation of gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime post would restore the court’s conservative majority and enable trump to leave a lasting imprint on america’s highest judicial body even as he regularly criticizes the federal judiciary. mcconnell said he had the necessary votes to approve the rule change with a simple majority vote, expected on thursday. republicans control the senate 52 48. the rule change has been dubbed the “nuclear option,” and trump has encouraged mcconnell to “go nuclear.” such a step would threaten to further erode trust between the parties in congress. “there’s a reason they call it the nuclear option, and that is because there’s fallout. and this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the senate for years to come,” democratic senator richard blumenthal told reporters. republicans were so confident they could use their muscle to pass the rule change that senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley said flatly that gorsuch “will be on the supreme court friday night.” amid a fierce debate over both gorsuch and the senate’s rules, mcconnell tried to tamp down any speculation that republicans would stage a monumental power grab by ending the filibuster for legislation. mcconnell said that as long as he was the senate’s majority leader, he would never remove the ability to mount a filibuster against legislation, as opposed to presidential appointments. mcconnell fought against many of former democratic president barack obama’s legislative initiatives when republicans were the minority party in the senate. “there’s not a single senator in the (republican) majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster, not one,” mcconnell told reporters. the move to change venerable senate rules reflects an intensifying of the already toxic partisanship in washington since trump took office in january. mcconnell’s promise to keep the ability to filibuster legislation could make it more difficult for republicans to get key parts of trump’s legislative agenda through the senate, considering the expected strong democratic opposition. a filibuster requires a super majority of 60 votes in the 100 seat senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a supreme court nominee or legislation. the 60 vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. the senate on tuesday kicked off its formal debate on confirming gorsuch, a colorado based appeals court judge, and mcconnell said he would get the clock ticking toward a vote expected on thursday to stop the democrats’ filibuster. democrats on monday amassed the votes needed to sustain the filibuster, prompting republicans to move toward changing the rules. democratic senator jeff merkley took to the senate floor on tuesday evening to rally support for the gorsuch filibuster. his office said in a statement that he “plans to hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking.” merkley’s “talking filibuster” is not expected to affect the republican timetable for gorsuch’s confirmation.  the filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s. the democrats were the first to use the “nuclear option.” in 2013, when they controlled the senate, they changed it to bar filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices. they did so after republicans filibustered obama’s appeals court nominees. “democrats are now being pushed by far left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country,” mcconnell said on the senate floor. “they seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time, and trying to take the senate with them.” top senate democrat chuck schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said it was the republicans who bore responsibility for the crisis and for deciding, as he said, to “break the rules.” he noted that the senate, under mcconnell’s guidance, refused last year to consider obama’s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump elected gorsuch to fill. “what the majority leader did to merrick garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster,” schumer said on the senate floor. restoring the nine seat high court’s conservative majority would fulfill one of trump’s top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. republicans say gorsuch is well qualified for the job and that there is no principled reason to oppose him. democrats say he is so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, has favored corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions, and has shown insufficient independence from trump.

" the trump administration must decide by the end of this month whether to grant belarus continued relief from u.s. economic sanctions despite a stiff government crackdown on street demonstrations last month. the renewal decision is considered a low level priority for the administration, which is facing bigger questions about u.s. relations with russia and china, and with most major diplomatic positions still unfilled. but whether the united states renews the sanctions relief or instead returns to blacklisting nine major belarus companies is an early test for the trump administration on the importance it puts on human rights versus efforts to coax countries in russia’s orbit to turn to the west. the sanctions waivers, which began in 2015 and were extended twice last year, were tied to domestic political reforms and intended to encourage belarus, which has long historical ties to russia, to move closer to the european union and the united states. now, however, u.s. officials are alarmed by the arrests of hundreds of people last month during an attempt to hold a street protest in the capital minsk, and concerned if continuing sanctions relief could be seen as ignoring the crackdown. belarus authorities last month raided a human rights group’s offices and used violence against peaceful protesters, rights groups say. “this most recent crackdown sharpened people’s focus,” said a u.s. congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “now there is a real question about whether or not they (the sanctions) should be reimposed.” the decision must be taken by the end of april. if the administration makes no decision, the sanctions will be re imposed. nato members, including poland and the baltic states, feel threatened by what they see as increased russian intervention in europe, including moscow’s annexation of ukraine’s crimea region in 2014. “belarus is so important from a strategic point of view and it’s so dependent economically on russia that we are really very concerned,” said piotr wilczek, the polish ambassador to the united states. “belarus is becoming more and more part of this wider russian problem we have.” the trump administration is inclined to renew the sanctions relief, but likely would wait until the last minute “to make sure they don’t do anything awful,” said a u.s. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. state and treasury department officials declined to comment in detail on the belarus sanctions. the belarus ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment. president george w. bush in 2006 blacklisted top belarus officials, including president alexander lukashenko, for undermining the country’s democratic processes or human rights abuses. the united states later added large belarus companies to the sanctions list. but in 2015, lukashenko released political prisoners and indicated he was open to better relations with the west. that october, president barack obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine belarus companies, including petrochemical conglomerate belneftekhim and tire manufacturer belshina.  now, however, lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in moscow’s orbit. in a letter to him last week, four u.s. senators said they were concerned over the crackdown and that he decided to allow russia to conduct “provocative” military exercises in belarus later this year.

" the american civil liberties union sued the u.s. department of homeland security in federal court on thursday, seeking records the civil rights group contends provide accounts of hunger strikes at immigration detention facilities. the aclu said in its filing that in recent weeks there have been a new series of hunger strikes at u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) detention centers in georgia, oregon and washington, adding hunger strikes have previously hit detention centers in arizona, florida, louisiana and texas. the suit comes as u.s. republican president donald trump has promised a crackdown on illegal immigration and the republican dominated u.s. congress this month agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for those suspected of illegally entering the country. “the trump administration’s plans to expand detention and strip away existing structures for oversight of detention are likely to produce more protests both inside and outside the walls of detention facilities,” the lawsuit filed in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia said. immigration and customs enforcement spokeswoman jennifer elzea said in an email: “ice is unable to comment on pending litigation.” the lawsuit said detention center inmates have launched the hunger strikes over the past few years as a non violent way to bring attention to what they see as a lack of access to bond hearings and inhumane conditions of confinement. the suit also said that some inmates who have previously launched hunger strikes were met with extraordinarily punitive responses. from april 1 22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ice. the white house in march requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the president’s goal of “enhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending ‘catch and release’ for those apprehended at the border.” the agreement reached in congress would increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the house appropriations committee. in april, hundreds of detainees at an immigration detention center in washington state began refusing meals in a hunger strike to protest conditions at the facility and delayed immigration hearings, activists said. the geo group inc, the company that operates the washington state facility and other detention centers around the united states, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

" south korea s foreign minister will visit japan this week to meet her japanese counterpart, the foreign ministry said on sunday, with seoul and tokyo seeking to boost cooperation over the handling of north korea s nuclear and missile programs. the need to confront the threat posed by north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear tests comes despite lingering tension over the issue of sexual slavery during japan s wartime occupation of korea. kang kyung wha will arrive in tokyo on tuesday and meet  japanese foreign minister taro kono during her two day visit, her first trip to japan as south korea s top diplomat, the foreign ministry in seoul said in a statement.   the two ministers will exchange views on issues of common interests focusing on bilateral relations and north korea related issues, including its nuclear programme,  the ministry statement said. south korea and japan are seeking to improve security cooperation over north korea, but there have been conflicting signals over whether they can resolve a feud over  comfort women  who were forced to work in japan s wartime military brothels. ties have been frozen over the issue, with south korean president moon jae in has promising to renegotiate an unpopular 2015 pact signed with japan.  under that pact, japan apologized again to former comfort women and promised 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) for a fund to help them. the two governments agreed the issue would be  irreversibly resolved  if both fulfilled their obligations.

" a bipartisan group of u.s. senators on tuesday plans to introduce legislation seeking to address vulnerabilities in computing devices embedded in everyday objects   known in the tech industry as the “internet of things”   which experts have long warned poses a threat to global cyber security.     the new bill would require vendors that provide internet connected equipment to the u.s. government to ensure their products are patchable and conform to industry security standards. it would also prohibit vendors from supplying devices that have unchangeable passwords or possess known security vulnerabilities.  republicans cory gardner and steve daines and democrats mark warner and ron wyden are sponsoring the legislation, which was drafted with input from technology experts at the atlantic council and harvard university. a senate aide who helped write the bill said that companion legislation in the house was expected soon. “we’re trying to take the lightest touch possible,” warner told reuters in an interview. he added that the legislation was intended to remedy an “obvious market failure” that has left device manufacturers with little incentive to build with security in mind. the legislation would allow federal agencies to ask the u.s. office of management and budget for permission to buy some non compliant devices if other controls, such as network segmentation, are in place. it would also expand legal protections for cyber researchers working in “good faith” to hack equipment to find vulnerabilities so manufacturers can patch previously unknown flaws.     security researchers have long said that the ballooning array of online devices including cars, household appliances, speakers and medical equipment are not adequately protected from hackers who might attempt to steal personal information or launch sophisticated cyber attacks. between 20 billion and 30 billion devices are expected to be connected to the internet by 2020, researchers estimate, with a large percentage of them insecure. though security for the internet of things has been a known  problem for years, some manufacturers say they are not well equipped to produce cyber secure devices. hundreds of thousands of insecure webcams, digital records and other everyday devices were hijacked last october to support a major attack on internet infrastructure that temporarily knocked some web services offline, including twitter, paypal and spotify.  the new legislation includes “reasonable security recommendations” that would be important to improve protection of federal government networks, said ray o’farrell, chief technology officer at cloud computing firm vmware.

" interpol voted on wednesday to admit the state of palestine as a member over israeli objections at the international police organization s general assembly in beijing. the decision came despite israeli efforts to delay a vote and prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a statement that the palestinians  joining the global police agency contravened signed agreements with israel. israel had argued that palestine is not a state and that it  is ineligible to join. under interim israeli palestinian peace deals, a palestinian authority was granted limited self rule in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip. shortly before the vote in the chinese capital, the israeli foreign ministry said israel s efforts to delay the ballot until next year had failed.   this victory was made possible because of the principled position of the majority of interpol members,  palestinian foreign minister riyad al maliki said in a statement. interpol said membership applications by the state of palestine and the solomon islands were approved at its annual general assembly by more than the required two thirds majority of votes. the organization now has 192 members. a palestinian bid to join last year, at an interpol conference in indonesia, was foiled by what israel said was its diplomatic campaign against it. in 2012, the u.n. general assembly upgraded the palestinian authority s observer status at the united nations to  non member state  from  entity , like the vatican. the step fell short of full u.n. membership, but it had important legal implications in enabling the palestinians to join the international criminal court and other world bodies.    netanyahu s statement said palestinian membership of interpol was one of the issues discussed during a meeting with u.s. president donald trump s middle east envoy, jason greenblatt, who is visiting the region.   netanyahu also raised the palestinian refusal to condemn an attack on tuesday in which a palestinian laborer shot dead three israeli guards in the israeli occupied west bank.  the actions of the palestinian leadership in the past few days directly harm the prospects of achieving peace and the palestinian diplomatic offensive will not go unanswered,  the statement said. some israeli media commentators have voiced concern that as an interpol member, palestine could ask the organization to issue a  red notice , an alert to police worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual, pending extradition. but the procedure does not appear to pose serious legal problems for israelis such as government officials and military officers whom pro palestinian groups have sought to have arrested by local authorities as suspected war criminals during overseas visits. a red notice is not an international arrest warrant, and on its website interpol notes that it cannot compel any member country to detain an individual named in one.

" a somali refugee who had been on a watch list over extremist views faced five counts of attempted murder and terror charges on sunday after canadian police said he stabbed a police officer and ran down four pedestrians with a car in edmonton, alberta. the suspect, a 30 year old man whom police did not identify, had been investigated two years ago for promoting extremist ideology but was not deemed a threat, the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp) said.  rcmp assistant commissioner marlin degrand said an  exhaustive investigation  into the man in 2015 did not uncover sufficient evidence to pursue charges. canadian media identified the suspect as abdulahi hasan sharif, although reuters was not immediately able to confirm his identity. police cordoned off an apartment block near downtown edmonton and plainclothes officers were seen carrying large bags of equipment into the building. the attacks in the western canadian city began when a chevy malibu hit a police officer standing in front of a football stadium at about 8:15 p.m. mountain time on saturday (10.15 p.m. et), sending him flying into the air. the driver got out of the car and stabbed the officer multiple times before fleeing, according to police accounts and surveillance footage of the incident. police identified the suspect when he was stopped at a checkpoint and his license showed that he was the owner of the malibu. he fled the checkpoint and was apprehended after a police chase across a downtown street, during which he hit four pedestrians. a flag of the islamic state militant group was found inside the malibu, said rod knecht, police chief of edmonton, alberta s provincial capital. edmonton mayor don iveson told reporters:  to the best of our knowledge, this was a lone wolf attack. there s no immediate cause for panic or concern.  u.s. national security agencies strongly leaned toward the conclusion that the suspect acted alone, although they were reviewing the matter, a u.s. official told reuters.  the police officer, who had stab wounds to the head and face, was released from a hospital on sunday along with two pedestrians. a third pedestrian was upgraded to stable from critical, while the fourth suffered a fractured skull and had regained consciousness. on sunday, two women were stabbed to death and their assailant shot dead by a soldier in the southern french port city of marseille in what officials describe as a  likely terrorist act . prime minister justin trudeau called the edmonton attack  another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against.  canada s government said it would keep the terrorist threat level at medium, where it has been since late 2014. the alberta muslim public affairs council denounced the attack and hundreds attended a sunday evening rally organized by the group.  these types of acts, whether terrorism or not, seek to divide communities. we have to show that s not going to happen, not in edmonton,  said group spokesman aurangzeb qureshi.  canada has been dealing in recent months with a surge in illegal border crossings by people seeking refugee status, which has renewed debate over whether it should tighten its borders.  the north american country has not experienced as much violence from extremist attacks as the united states and western european nations, but there have been several deadly incidents in recent years. in january, a french canadian university student was charged with murder after six people were shot and killed inside a quebec city mosque, in what trudeau called  a terrorist attack.  in august 2016, canadian police raided an ontario home and killed aaron driver, who they said was an islamic state supporter preparing an attack on a canadian city with a homemade bomb. in 2014, canada was stunned by two deadly attacks that police said were the work of homegrown radicals and led to tougher new anti terrorism measures.  a gunman killed a soldier at ottawa s national war memorial before launching an attack on the canadian parliament in october 2014. in the same week, a man ran down two soldiers in quebec, killing one. in 2015, a videotape attributed to al shabaab, a somali based islamist militant group behind a deadly 2013 attack on a kenyan shopping center, threatened north american malls, including the west edmonton mall.

" lebanon s saad al hariri can only prove he is free by returning home from saudi arabia where he went to announce his resignation as prime minister, lebanon s foreign minister said on tuesday. hariri s abrupt resignation on nov. 4 threw lebanon into crisis and put it center stage in a power struggle between sunni muslim saudi arabia and shi ite iran, whose ally hezbollah is powerful in lebanese politics. hariri said on tuesday he would return to lebanon within two days.  we hope to resolve this with the quick and immediate return of prime minister hariri to his country ... where he has the right to do what he wants,  foreign minister gebran bassil said after meeting french president emmanuel macron in paris.   the only thing that proves he is free is that he returns. right now he is in a situation that is ambiguous and not normal. we want to return to a normal situation,  he told reporters after the talks about how to end the crisis. france is a permanent member of the u.n. security council and lebanon s former colonial power. it is also penholder on lebanon for potential resolutions. there has been some talk that beirut could go to the u.n. if hariri did not return this week.  the president (michel aoun) spoke of a timeframe of one week from when this diplomatic campaign started to try to find a solution otherwise we would have to go to international laws,   he said. french officials say there is no u.n. action in the works at the moment. lebanese politicians and bankers say saudi arabia intends to do to their country what it did to qatar   corral arab allies into enforcing an economic blockade unless its demands are met. bassil said any saudi sanctions on his country would hurt syrian refugees and destabilize the region.   any (saudi) measures would not only be targeting lebanon and its stability, this would be a punishment for the region because any instability in lebanon would cause instability in the region,  he said.  the first to be affected in this would be syrians in lebanon,  he said, adding that sanctions could make it harder for lebanese population to absorb the syrian refugees in their midst. lebanon hosts some 1.5 million syrian refugees that have fled the neighboring civil war.  in the first such statement by a french official, prime minister edouard philippe on tuesday called on hariri to return to lebanon. foreign minister jean yves le drian is due in the saudi capital riyadh on wednesday to discuss the crisis and is expected to meet hariri.

" u.s. vice president mike pence will underscore the u.s. partnership with israel during a trip to the middle east next week while seeking to shore up u.s. relations with the arab world after president donald trump recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel. pence, a strong supporter of trump s decision, will spend three days in the region with stops in israel and egypt, the first high level official to visit after the president reversed decades of u.s. policy and announced the united states would start the process of moving its embassy from tel aviv. the status of jerusalem, which holds muslim, jewish and christian holy sites, is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between israel and the palestinians, who were furious over trump s move and have declined to meet with pence. the international community does not recognize israeli sovereignty over the full city. israel considers jerusalem its eternal capital, while palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. pence, an evangelical christian who had planned to highlight the plight of christian minorities during his trip, will not meet with palestinian christians or with officials from the coptic christian church, who declined a meeting in response to the u.s. move.  officials said pence still would discuss the persecution of christians as well as the jerusalem decision, countering iran, defeating islamic state militants and fighting  extremist ideology.  the dates of his trip have been in flux because of trump s u.s. tax overhaul push and the possibility that pence would be needed to provide a tie breaking vote in the senate.  he is now scheduled to depart washington on tuesday, arriving in cairo on wednesday for a meeting with egypt s president abdel fattah al sisi.   he flies to israel later on wednesday and will meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu and president reuven rivlin,  deliver a speech to the israeli parliament, and visit jerusalem s western wall.  we can t envision a scenario under which the western wall would not be part of israel,  one administration official told reporters on a conference call. the trip will be dominated by the continuing fallout from trump s announcement.      the last couple weeks in the region have been a reaction to the jerusalem decision,  another administration official said.  this trip is part of ... the ending of that chapter, and the beginning of what i will say is the next chapter.  that view may not be shared by arab leaders. palestinian president mahmoud abbas said the united states abdicated its responsibility as a mediator on peace and pence s planned visit to bethlehem was scrapped. pence does not plan to encourage egypt to pressure the palestinians to return to the negotiating table, an official said.  we think it s appropriate for the palestinians to digest what has happened. and once they review the president s remarks clearly, they will realize that nothing has changed in terms of being able to reach an historic peace agreement,  he said. arab legislators have announced they will stay away from pence s speech to the knesset.  in egypt, the sisi government will have a chance to discuss the recent u.s. decision to suspend some of egypt s military aid package because of washington s concerns over civil liberties. egypt is a strategic u.s. partner because of its control of the suez canal and sisi presents himself as a bulwark against islamist militants in the region. on friday pence departs israel for germany, where he will visit u.s. troops on his way back to washington.

" draft legislation responding to u.s. president donald trump’s refusal to certify the iran nuclear deal would set tough new terms for the pact, including restoring sanctions if iran tests a ballistic missile able to carry a warhead or bars nuclear inspectors from any sites. critics of the legislation drafted by republican senators bob corker and tom cotton, with support from the trump administration, said it could put the united states in violation of the international agreement if it were enacted. the draft, seen by reuters on tuesday, was in the works on oct. 13 when trump announced he would not formally certify that tehran was complying with the international nuclear pact, and called on congress to write legislation to toughen it. since then, corker has met with senate democratic colleagues, at least some of whom would have to back the legislation for it to pass. they have insisted that washington work with european allies who co signed the deal before making any changes. britain, france, germany and the european union, which also signed the nuclear accord   as did russia and china   warned that trump’s plan could cause a split with washington and risked u.s. credibility abroad. corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, told reuters last week that the trump administration must work closely with european allies as it develops its new iran policy. the draft legislation, a proposed amendment to the iran nuclear agreement review act passed in 2015, broadens a required administration assessment on whether iran is complying with the pact to add factors related to issues from trade to whether iran is using commercial aircraft licensed by the united states for non civil aviation purposes. as previously reported, it would instantly reimpose, or “snap back” sanctions lifted under the agreement if iran were deemed capable of developing a nuclear weapon within a year. the iran issue has been complicated by trump’s recent attacks on corker, in which he blamed him for the nuclear deal forged under former democratic president barack obama. the pact, which world leaders have urged trump not to derail, was opposed by every republican in congress including corker.  corker has lashed back at trump by saying he has failed to grow into the job as president and blaming him for breaking down important international relationships. a spokeswoman for corker did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how the dispute with the president might affect the iran legislation.

" during his 2016 election campaign, donald trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians. the u.s. embassy would move to jerusalem, he would name an ambassador who backs israeli settlements on land palestinians seek for a state and there would be no pressure for peace talks. but as trump prepares for his first white house meeting with prime minister benjamin netanyahu, his administration has not only toned down its pro israel bravado but also taken the first tentative steps toward a more cautious middle east diplomacy, including consultations with sunni arab allies and u.s. lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. while any strategy is still far from complete, there is growing consensus in the white house that tackling the israeli palestinian conflict could require gentle nudging of israel together with assurances to the arab world that trump will be more even handed than his campaign rhetoric suggested. “this is a case where campaign promises run head on into geopolitical reality and they have to be adjusted accordingly,” said a u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. as a result, relocating the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem – a step world leaders including jordan’s king abdullah warned against and which would probably inflame the muslim world   has been put on hold for now.  at the same time, the white house has adopted a more measured stance on israeli settlement building in occupied territory than candidate trump appeared to advocate. even so, there is little doubt that when netanyahu meets trump on wednesday, he will find a republican president determined to show more warmth to israel than his democratic predecessor, barack obama, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship. social media exchanges have suggested a budding “bromance” between netanyahu and trump, who has pledged to be the “best friend” israel has ever had in the white house. as a result, palestinians fear their leaders will be frozen out and their statehood aspirations pushed aside. one white house aide cautioned that the administration is still in “listening mode” on the issue. since taking office on jan. 20, trump has spoken by phone to egyptian, saudi and united arab emirates leaders and heard abdullah’s concerns in person. all of these countries have growing contacts with israel, mostly behind the scenes and centered on a shared desire to counter iran, a point that netanyahu has often cited as among the grounds for his country’s eventual thaw with the arab world. signaling an emerging view that u.s. arab allies could be helpful on the israeli palestinian issue, trump’s son in law, jared kushner, assigned to a senior role in middle east diplomacy, has met arab officials, including the uae’s ambassador to washington, the new york times reported. in his talks with trump, netanyahu is expected to try to keep the focus on forging a common front against iran, israel’s regional enemy and a target of trump’s ire. the israeli palestinian dispute will nonetheless be on the agenda, especially after israel’s parliament drew international condemnation for approving a law retroactively legalizing 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned palestinian land. barring a curve ball from the sometimes unpredictable u.s. president, trump is unlikely to use the talks to press netanyahu for concessions toward the palestinians in the way obama did. but neither can trump afford to be seen to abandon the u.s. commitment to a two state solution, the bedrock of washington’s middle east policy since the 1993 interim peace accords and a principle embraced internationally. a white house statement on feb. 2 set forth a more nuanced position, backing away from a longstanding u.s. view of settlements as an “impediment” to peace but instead saying new settlements or the expansion of existing ones beyond current boundaries “may not be helpful” to that goal. that shift transpired just hours after trump met briefly with king abdullah on the sidelines of an event in washington. even so, the emerging shape of trump policy remains more accommodating toward israel than at any time since republican george w. bush occupied the white house. “it seems we are headed for a new policy with this administration that is different from its predecessor in how it deals with the palestinian leadership and the palestinian cause,” said wasel abu youssef, a member of the palestine liberation organization’s executive committee.  there has been no contact between the palestinian leadership and the trump administration so far, palestinian officials said. moderate, western backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas was among the first world leaders obama called on his first full day in office in 2009. a white house official insisted, however, that the administration intends to develop a relationship with the palestinian authority. all the same, many israeli officials do not read the white house’s settlements statement as a warning to israel or a reining in of netanyahu. not only does it conclude that settlements do not block peace prospects, it also says construction within established settlements is acceptable to washington. “bibi will be happy,” said an israeli diplomat, using netanyahu’s nickname. “he can put new settlements on hold and hold off the right wing by pointing to trump. at the same time, he can build as much as he wants within existing settlements.” in that regard, the lines drawn by the white house help netanyahu fend off demands from the far right in his coalition for sweeping steps, like annexing portions of the west bank. palestinians would be especially alarmed if trump decided to proceed with moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem, essentially recognizing the city as israel’s capital despite international insistence that its status must be decided in negotiations. the palestinians want east jerusalem, captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as the capital of their future state. trump and his aides have played down the prospects for a quick embassy move since he took office. some experts see a moderating influence in trump’s national security team. it has members such as secretary of state rex tillerson, a former exxon mobil chief executive with extensive contacts among gulf arab governments, and defense secretary jim mattis, a retired marine general. they will have to deal with other, sometimes ideologically driven advisers with close personal ties to trump. david friedman, trump’s former bankruptcy lawyer and now nominee as ambassador to israel, has raised funds for a west bank settlement and voiced doubt about palestinian statehood. kushner’s family has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the same settlement. aides may be moving circumspectly also in hope of keeping the door open if trump – who has touted his skills as a master dealmaker – decides to seek what he has called the “ultimate deal”: israeli palestinian peace.  to pursue such an initiative, the united states needs to be seen as an even handed mediator, while also overcoming the rigid disputes that have scuppered so many peace efforts over the years: settlements, borders, the status of jerusalem, what to do with palestinian refugees, and palestinian political divisions. the last, u.s. brokered round of peace talks collapsed in 2014. it remains to be seen whether the trump administration will be inclined to devote much attention to the israeli palestinian issue at a time when it is distracted by other priorities. in the middle east alone, the fight against islamic state and countering iran are higher on the agenda.  however, if trump at some point does opt to wade in where so many of his predecessors have failed, for netanyahu – who is looking for a reset of u.s. israeli relations – it might be a case of “be careful what you wish for”.

" the bullet riddled body of a news photographer was found in central mexico on friday, state officials, putting 2017 on track to become the deadliest year yet for journalists in the notoriously violent country. edgar daniel esqueda, 23, who worked with metropoli san luis and vox populi slp in the state of san luis potosi, was found in the state capital with at least three bullet wounds in the back of his neck, authorities said.  the news outlets where esqueda worked reported had reported his abduction from his home by gunmen on thursday morning.  san luis potosi s governor, manuel carreras, told a press conference an investigation was underway. he did not say whether  esqueda s murder was linked to his work as a journalist.  with esqueda s killing, 2017 could become the bloodiest  year yet for reporters in mexico, according to press freedom and journalists  advocacy group articulo 19. the photo journalist was the 11th reporter killed so far this year, the group said. that matched the total in 2016, which was the highest number on record in a country torn by runaway levels of criminal and drug related bloodletting. over the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in mexico, 38 of them under the current government of president enrique pena nieto.  reporters without borders and the committee for the protection of journalists (cpj) both rank mexico among the deadliest countries in the world for reporters. activists have repeatedly criticized mexican prosecutors for failing to fully investigate many journalists  murders, allowing the killers to operate with impunity. mexico s human rights commission has asked state authorities to provide protection for esqueda s family members, who were at home with the photographer when he was taken by force, according to articulo 19. witnesses who spoke with the group said esqueda asked his kidnappers for their identity when they broke into the home where he was asleep with his wife, and they responded that they were police officers. the state police force said via twitter that  there has not been any police action against a reporter in the capital.   criminals, sometimes connected with state actors, know that they can get away with killing journalists in mexico because of  chronic impunity for these crimes. until that changes, the violence will continue,  alexandra ellerbeck, the cpj s program coordinator for north america, said in a statement. esqueda had reported threats months ago to a government run human rights group in san luis potosi, one of his colleagues told reuters.

" brazil s scandal plagued political class voted on wednesday to set up a 1.7 billion reais ($542 million) fund with taxpayer money to finance election campaigns, making up for a dearth of private funding ahead of next year s general election. a ban on corporate donations coupled with the drying up of under the table contributions and kickbacks in the wake of the country s biggest corruption scandal have left lawmakers struggling to raise campaign funding. the lower house of congress approved a bill that had passed the senate and will take funds from pork barrel appropriations and government payments to buy tv and radio time for parties. the fund was meant to be part of improvements to brazil s discredited political system to reduce a proliferation of parties that has made it hard to govern latin america s largest nation without unwieldy coalitions based on self interest. the senate unanimously approved on tuesday a constitutional amendment that limits coalitions to parties with similar platforms, but it will not go into effect until the 2022 elections. more than 100 lawmakers are targeted by the car wash corruption investigation that uncovered a network of bribes from private companies seeking to win contracts or influence policies, and even implicated president michel temer and several of his cabinet ministers. critics of the campaign fund said it was aimed at providing funding for lawmakers seeking re election to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption.  it is shameful that this fund will be used by unethical politicians who should not be sitting here in congress,  said julio delgado, leader of the brazilian socialist party (psb).  not a single lawmaker under investigation has opposed it.  backers of the use of public money for campaigns argued that organized crime would step in to finance politicians if funding was lacking. the sprawling car wash graft investigation that convicted dozens of executives from brazil s main contractor companies has shut down the flow of undeclared payments to politicians.  what most worries them is where they will get money for their campaigns now that companies cannot donate and are not willing to engage in illegal contributions,  said lucas de arag o, partner at political risk consultancy arko advice. on the positive side, he said, congress set a threshold for parties to be able to access public funding and free tv time based on the votes they win, which will help reduce the number of parties, today totaling 35. (this version of the story corrects the fifth paragraph to say coalitions reform will not go into effect until the 2022 elections). ",0
" there is disagreement within president elect donald trump’s camp about the structure of the top u.s. intelligence agency when he takes office and it is unclear whether his national security adviser will prevail in advocating a reorganization, sources familiar with the matter said on thursday. at issue is the office of the director of national intelligence (odni), which congress created after the sept. 11 attacks to better coordinate the efforts of u.s. intelligence agencies to protect the united states. trump security adviser michael flynn, who as head of the pentagon’s defense intelligence agency under president barack obama sometimes clashed with other intelligence agencies, favors restructuring and paring back the odni, the sources said. but one source close to the trump transition cautioned that the outcome is not certain. “there is a general consensus that the odni is too big and grown too fast. some around him (trump) believe this, but whether they plan to address it or how, i just don’t know,” said the source, who like others requested anonymity to discuss the trump team’s internal deliberations. flynn has had a fraught relationship with the odni. after complaints over his management style at the defense intelligence agency, he was fired by director of national intelligence james clapper. a senior transition official told reuters on thursday that trump has picked former u.s. senator dan coats as his director of national intelligence   a sign trump does not plan to try to eliminate odni. a u.s. official familiar with coats’ views suggested he would not move precipitously to overhaul u.s. intelligence agencies. “any possible reforms to the structure of the intelligence community, he would approach with great caution and responsibility,” the official said. relations between trump and u.s. intelligence agencies are extraordinarily rocky even before he is sworn in on jan. 20. trump disparaged the spy agencies’ conclusions that russia was behind hacks of the democratic national committee and the campaign staff of his 2016 election opponent hillary clinton. clapper told congress thursday he was “even more resolute” that russia staged cyber attacks, rebuking trump’s skepticism. trump was scheduled to be briefed on friday on an intelligence report that reaches that conclusion. russia has denied the hacking allegations. “i think the president elect is more skeptical of the conclusions that are drawn from the raw data rather than the intelligence in the raw data that’s provided,” trump spokesman sean spicer told reporters on wednesday. coats, according to another u.s. official familiar with his views, said he knew a lot about europe and russia and may well “butt heads with trump over russia.” the wall street journal reported on wednesday that trump is working with top advisers to restructure and reduce the size of the odni. that report largely reflects the views of flynn, said a  source familiar with the retired lieutenant general’s thinking who declined to be identified. trump spokesman sean spicer on thursday rejected the report. “there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure,” spicer said. “all transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative.” a broad intelligence reorganization would require congressional action. congress created odni in a 2004 law that makes it the parent of 16 other u.s. intelligence agencies, ranging from the cia and the dia to the eavesdropping national security agency and the state department’s intelligence bureau. flynn, who served as a top military intelligence officer in afghanistan and iraq, is said by those familiar with his views to favor major changes at the cia as well. both on the battlefield and at the dia, flynn pushed for intelligence personnel to be moved out of compounds and offices and closer to front lines, where flynn believed they would be more effective intelligence collectors, said the source familiar with his views. flynn would like the cia to reorganize itself along these lines, the source said. the cia was just reorganized last year, however, to bring frontline spies and backroom analysts together in new units focused tightly on specific issues or regions. republican congressman mike pompeo, trump’s choice for cia director, is known to share flynn’s views about the need for restructuring at cia, the source said. but two other people familiar with trump transition discussions said pompeo has not been involved in talks about possible cia reorganization.

" british prime minister theresa may spoke on monday to u.s. president donald trump and agreed that “a window of opportunity”  exists to persuade russia to break ties with syrian president bashar al assad, may’s office said. a spokeswoman for the prime minister said trump had thanked may for her support following last week’s u.s. military action in syria against the assad regime. the white house later on monday said trump had spoken with may and separately with german chancellor angela merkel by telephone about the u.s. attack and thanked them for their support.  it said in a statement that may and merkel expressed support for the u.s. action and agreed with trump on the importance of holding assad accountable.   in a shift in washington’s strategy, u.s. missiles hit a syrian air base last week in retaliation for what the united states and its allies say was a poison gas attack by syria’s military in which scores of civilians died. the syrian government has denied it was behind the assault. trump had previously appeared disinclined to intervene against the syrian leader and the attack raised expectations that he might now be ready to adopt a tougher than expected stance with russia, assad’s main backer. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson is due to travel to moscow this week and the spokeswoman for may said the two leaders had agreed during their conversation that the visit was an opportunity to make progress toward a solution. “the prime minister and the president agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade russia that its alliance with assad is no longer in its strategic interest,” the spokeswoman said. “they agreed that u.s. secretary of state tillerson’s visit to moscow this week provides an opportunity to make progress toward a solution which will deliver a lasting political settlement.” the spokeswoman said the two leaders had also stressed the importance of the international community, including china, putting pressure on north korea to constrain the threat it poses.

" the special counsel investigation of links between russia and president trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent republican senator said on sunday. lindsey graham, who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference. “this investigation will go forward. it will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program. “and we all need to let mr. mueller do his job. i think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election, and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or co ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january. it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president. trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair.”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington. three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating, as well as mueller, whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the u.s. federal bureau of investigation (fbi). several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign, and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election. graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy, christopher steele, which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry.   on saturday, the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe, but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton.  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier. it bothers me greatly the way they used it, and i want somebody to look at it,” graham said. but he said the russia investigation must continue. “as a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis held talks with indian leaders on tuesday, vowing to jointly stamp out militant sanctuaries and seeking india s greater involvement in helping to stabilize afghanistan. the comments come as president donald trump s administration has stepped up pressure on pakistan for more action against militant groups operating from its soil that are blamed for attacks in india and neighboring afghanistan. islamabad denies giving material support to the militants and instead accuses its arch rival of trying to use afghanistan as a base for anti pakistan activities.  but mattis, the trump administration s first cabinet official to visit india, said the two countries would work together to fight terrorism.        there can be no tolerance of terrorist safe havens,  he said in a statement.  as global leaders, india and the united states resolve to work together to eradicate this scourge.    washington welcomed indian efforts to promote stability in afghanistan, he added. new delhi has committed $3 billion in development projects in afghanistan and trains afghan officers in india.  but it has not sent soldiers in the international effort to restore peace.  our engagement in afghanistan will continue, we shall expand our engagement,  indian defence minister nirmala sitharaman said, following talks with mattis.     defence ties between india and the united states have expanded rapidly, with new delhi buying u.s. weapons worth $15 billion over the last decade, moving away from traditional supplier russia. military experts say u.s. weapons transfers aim at bolstering indian capabilities to develop a counterweight against china s growing assertiveness in recent years. indian and u.s. negotiators are now trying to move forward with a deal to supply the indian navy with 22 sea guardian drone aircraft, whose june approval by the u.s. government was the first such clearance to a non nato ally.  india wants the unarmed drones to help its navy lengthen the duration of its surveillance in the indian ocean, where chinese naval ships and submarines make regular forays. expanding naval cooperation with india was a top priority, mattis said, adding that three way exercises involving the united states, india and japan boosted operational cooperation.  the united states has been critical of china s build up of military facilities in the south china sea. but new delhi turned down a u.s. suggestion of regional joint patrols with the indian navy, for fear of a chinese backlash.  china looms very large for both countries,  said dhruva jaishankar, a specialist on india u.s. relations at brookings india.   the strategic underpinning of india us defense ties is in the common concerns they have over china, over its revisionism.     the indian air force has also asked for 90 armed avenger predator drones that experts say could be deployed for cross border strikes, such as targeting militant camps india says exist on pakistan s side of disputed kashmir.  such a sale would need white house and congress approval, sources said. but pakistan and, possibly, china could see the move as destabilizing.  dronemaker general atomics is pleased the indian government has won approval for the surveillance version of the drone, said vivek lall, its chief executive for u.s. and international strategic development.  not only will this platform enhance india s capabilities in the areas of maritime domain awareness and security, but the interoperability with one of the u.s. s most important strategic partners will contribute to security across the region.   the two sides will also discuss lockheed martin s (lmt.n) offer to build f 16 fighter planes in india as part of prime minister narendra modi s drive to build a domestic military industrial base.  we look forward to sharing some of our most advanced defense technologies,  mattis said.  sweden s saab (saabb.st) is the other contender for the deal to supply at least 100 single engine combat planes.

" venezuela s opposition cried foul on monday over the ruling socialists  win in gubernatorial elections, raising the threat of more foreign sanctions following the vote in what the united states called  an authoritarian dictatorship.  president nicolas maduro s candidates took 17 governorships, versus five for the opposition, in sunday s nationwide poll, according to the pro government electoral board.  the socialists  strong showing came despite devastating food shortages, triple digit inflation, and a collapsing currency.  polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. dismayed leaders of the democratic unity coalition demanded an audit after citing a litany of abuses, including multiple voting, state food handouts on the day of the poll, forced attendance at gunpoint and suspicious phone and power outages. the opposition fell short of offering detailed evidence of outright fraud, however, and there were no conventional foreign observer missions to verify claims of vote rigging.  this is a process of electoral fraud without precedent in our history,  said opposition spokesman angel oropeza. an estimated 1 million voters were blocked from voting, he said, referring to claims the election board skewed results by relocating hundreds of polling places away from opposition strongholds.  many dispirited opposition supporters now see foreign pressure as their only real hope of hurting maduro ahead of next year s presidential vote. the united states condemned the elections as neither free nor fair and vowed to keep up pressure on maduro for the erosion of democracy in the south american opec nation.  as long as the maduro regime conducts itself as an authoritarian dictatorship, we will work with members of the international community and bring the full weight of american economic and diplomatic power to bear in support of the venezuelan people as they seek to restore their democracy,  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement. the trump administration has already imposed sanctions on maduro and top officials, including election board head tibisay lucena. washington has also struck at the government s ability to raise more funds via foreign debt. the european union could also take measures against maduro, who was narrowly elected to replace the late leader hugo chavez in 2013. french president emmanuel macron, who has also branded venezuela a dictatorship, expressed concern at claims of  serious irregularities  and  lack of transparency  in the gubernatorial vote.  france deplores this situation and is working with its eu partners to examine appropriate measures to help resolve the serious crisis,  the french foreign ministry said. venezuela s government, which insisted in advance of sunday s vote that it would demonstrate its commitment to democracy, still retains significant support in poorer, rural settings. and it seems unlikely that supporters of the elite led opposition, which has struggled to capitalize on discontent over the economy, will return to the streets en masse after months of grueling protests earlier this year. the protests failed to pressure the government into holding an early presidential election, freeing scores of jailed activists or accepting foreign humanitarian aid. at least 125 people died, while thousands were injured and arrested in violence.  obviously, this was a brutal fraud,  said david osorio, 21, who lost an eye when he was hit by a gas cannister in the clashes.  but i don t know if going back to the streets is best ... because the same will happen and many are simply not willing.  a few hundred opposition protesters massed in front of the electoral council in the southern bolivar state, where results were still not given by monday evening. the national guard used tear gas to scatter the crowd, according to a reuters witness.      various opposition leaders acknowledged disillusionment and people staying home had played a big role.  we shot ourselves in the foot,  legislator jose guerra said, noting record turnout of 74 percent in a 2015 congress vote, which the opposition won, versus 61 percent on sunday.  flanked by his powerful wife, soldiers, and red shirted party members, a jubilant maduro painted the opposition as sore losers.  when they lose they cry fraud. when they win they shout  down with maduro,  said maduro, 54. the opposition pocketed governorships including the turbulent andean states of merida and tachira and the oil producing region of zulia.  the government, which had previously controlled 20 governorships, took states across venezuela s languid plains and steamy caribbean coast. it won back populous miranda state, which includes part of the capital caracas, and also won in barinas, chavez s home state, where his younger brother retained the top job.

" tokyo governor yuriko koike, whose new party is challenging japanese prime minister shinzo abe s ruling bloc in the oct. 22 national election, said she would  100 percent  not run in the poll, the latest twist in a drama giving voters whiplash. speculation has persisted that koike, a former ldp member and defense minister, would resign to run for a seat in parliament needed to make a bid for the premiership.  i have been saying i will not run for the election from the beginning,  koike said in an interview with the yomiuri newspaper reported on tuesday.  i m 100 percent not running for the election.  she later repeated the comment to reporters.  if koike does not personally contest this election, then analysts believe she would hope her party positions itself to win the next national poll, and that she gains a voter boost from the 2020 tokyo olympics.  abe announced the snap election last week in hopes his liberal democratic party led coalition would keep its majority in parliament s lower house, where it held a two thirds  super majority  before the chamber was dissolved. but koike s new party of hope   launched just last week as a  reformist, conservative  alternative to abe s equally conservative ldp   has clouded the outlook amid signs voters are disillusioned with abe after nearly five years in power. koike s dilemma was whether to run for a seat now and face a backlash from voters for quitting as governor little more than a year since she defied the ldp to run successfully for the post, or risk letting a shot at the top job slip through her fingers. some analysts saw her decision not to seek a seat now as a sign koike thinks her party s momentum is fading.  she must have thought it would not be worthwhile abandoning the post of tokyo governor to become a head of an opposition,   said tetsuro kato, a professor emeritus at hitotsubashi university. koike has been getting negative media coverage for saying she would  exclude  candidates who do not agree with her party s policies   a stance seen as barring liberal members of the failed main opposition democratic party from joining. leaders of the democratic party   a fractious mix of conservatives and liberals   decided last week it would not run candidates of its own but let members run from koike s party. koike s comment was applauded by some as an effort to ensure policy consistency but by others as a dictatorial maneuver.  she s branding a very new party and has to make clear what it stands for, but the danger is that while abe owned the  arrogance of power  space, she is now vying for some of that,  said jeffrey kingston, director of asian studies at temple university japan.  abe s support rates fell earlier this year due to suspected cronyism scandals and many voters  perception that he had grown complacent and arrogant after nearly five years in office.  his rating later rebounded but dropped again to 37 percent in the latest poll by public broadcaster nhk. koike s party is insisting those who want to run on its ticket sign a policy pledge, including revising the pacifist constitution and exercising the right of collective self defense, or militarily aiding allies under attack defense, a document seen by reuters showed.  many liberals balk at those policies. koike s party on tuesday unveiled a list of 192 candidates for the lower house election. that compares with 233 seats needed for a simple majority.  the party plans to announce more candidates in the coming days, but a senior party member conceded that it will be a tall order to win a majority.   although (fielding) 233 candidates is a very high mountain, we would like to finish climbing it. on the other hand, in actuality, it would be considerably difficult for us alone to gain a majority even if we fielded 233,  said goshi hosono, a founding member of the party and former environment minister.   further complicating the outlook, liberals from the democratic party launched a constitutional democratic party of japan. the csdp could split the opposition vote and help abe s bloc keep its majority, but by how much is tough to predict.  koike is tough, she s resilient and she can tap into the fact that abe s negative ratings are pretty high and a lot of people out there are unhappy with him,  kingston said.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan on tuesday sharply criticized republican presidential candidate donald trump’s twitter post depicting democratic rival hillary clinton against a backdrop of cash and a star of david, saying anti semitic images have “no place in a presidential campaign.” “candidates should know that,” ryan, the highest ranking elected republican, said in an interview with radio station wtmj in milwaukee, two days before trump was due to meet house and senate republicans in washington. “i really believe he’s got to clean up the way his new media works,” he said, in a reference to trump’s social media efforts. the presumptive republican nominee has frequently used twitter to skewer his opponents and push his proposals. the radio station posted audio from the interview on its website, and the wisconsin congressman’s office provided a transcript of the session. ryan’s comments came a day after trump defended the tweet, saying he had not meant the six pointed star to refer to the star of david, which is a symbol of judaism. rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff’s badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a “plain star.” republican leaders were criticized in the u.s. media for not speaking out forcefully against the image attacking clinton, which appeared over the u.s. independence day holiday weekend. “if i had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this (trump) campaign, i’d have no time for anything else,” said ryan, who supports trump but has repeatedly spoken out against trump’s rhetoric, including his criticism of a mexican american judge. “my understanding is, this was done by staff not by he himself,” ryan said. “but more importantly, they’ve got clean this thing up.” trump is due to meet with house and senate republicans in washington on thursday. ryan did not say whether the tweet was likely to come up.  house republican leader kevin mccarthy told reporters that the meeting would mainly focus on the newly released republican agenda, which addresses six types of issue from poverty to tax reform. “but members will be free to talk about all different angles, and ideas, and probably some people will give their opinions and ideas on how to run the campaign,” mccarthy said. asked about his comfort level with trump, the california republican replied: “i always look for constant improvement.” ",0

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson’s visit to moscow this week will be an early test of whether the trump administration can use any momentum generated by a missile attack on a syrian air base to craft and execute a strategy to end the syrian war. even before trump ordered last week’s strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, tillerson’s visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues, including russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election, an apparent violation of an important arms control treaty, and seeing what cooperation, if any, is possible in the fight against islamic state. now, tillerson, a former oil executive with no diplomatic experience, is charged with avoiding a major u.s. confrontation with russia while exacting some concessions from moscow. those include getting rid of syrian president bashar al assad’s remaining chemical weapons and pressing assad to negotiate syria’s future. the kremlin said on monday tillerson was not scheduled to meet with russian president vladimir putin during his visit, a move that could point to tensions. it may also suggest that tillerson will instead follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov. the state department said last week a meeting had not been confirmed with putin, who met with tillerson when the texan headed exxon mobil. russia, along with iran, is assad’s primary backer, and its intervention in syria’s war has been crucial to ensuring his grip on power, although no longer over the entire country. tillerson said he had not seen hard evidence that russia knew ahead of time about the chemical weapons attack, which killed at least 70 people, but he planned to urge moscow to rethink its support for assad in the april 12 talks. “i’m hopeful that we can have constructive talks with the russian government, with foreign minister lavrov and have russia be supportive of a process that will lead to a stable syria,” tillerson told abc’s “the week” on sunday. the u.s. cruise missile strike on thursday, meant to dissuade assad from using chemical weapons again, gives tillerson more credibility with russian officials and will boost his efforts, observers and former officials said.   “the demonstration of the administration’s willingness to use force has the potential to add some leverage to the diplomacy,” said antony blinken, a deputy to former secretary of state john kerry. the u.s. strike   ordered less than three days after the gas attack   could make it clear to russia that the united states will hold moscow accountable for assad, blinken said. tillerson ought to be “very matter of fact” in his meetings, blinken said, sending russia a message that: “if you don’t rein him in, we will take further action.” tillerson said on thursday that russia had “failed in its responsibility” to remove syria’s chemical weapons under a 2013 agreement, which he argued showed russia was either complicit with the gas attacks or “simply incompetent.” securing a russian commitment on eliminating assad’s chemical weapons is likely to be first on his agenda, said evelyn farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the obama administration. the talks will be a major test of tillerson’s diplomatic skills. as a former chief executive at exxon mobil, he has experience doing business in russia, but no background in the often public negotiations that international diplomacy requires. it also is unclear if trump, who has expressed skepticism about multilateral institutions such as the european union and united nations, will have patience for the protracted negotiations that a comprehensive deal on syria would require. russia condemned the missile strike as illegal and putin said it would harm u.s. russia ties. moscow also said it would keep military channels of communication open with washington, but would not exchange any information through them. it was an unforeseen turn of events for trump, who praised putin repeatedly during last year’s election campaign and said he would like to work more closely with russia to defeat islamic state. just over a week ago, top administration officials were signaling that removing assad is no longer a u.s. priority. but one senior official said it was significant that russia suspended, and did not cancel, cooperation with the united states after the air strike. nor did lavrov cancel tillerson’s visit to moscow, suggesting russia may be willing to tolerate the single strike. as of this weekend, the talks were still on. “they’re going to try to draw a line around this incident,” said alexander vershbow, a former u.s. ambassador to russia during the george w. bush administration. “they are still not giving up on working with the trump administration.” the trump administration also wants to keep the focus in syria on defeating islamic state rather than opening a conflict with russia or syria’s government. another u.s. official said one hope is that moscow will see tillerson’s visit and a discussion about how to cooperate to stop assad’s use of banned weapons as a tacit acknowledgement of russia’s great power status, one of putin’s main ambitions. “the strikes aren’t necessarily a bad thing for russia,” said andrew tabler, a fellow with the washington institute for near east policy. “russia’s had a very hard time getting president assad to come to the negotiating table in any kind of meaningful way.” now, tabler said, the russians can point to more u.s. strikes as the price of further intransigence by assad.

" myanmar government forces found on sunday the bodies of 28 hindu villagers who authorities suspected were killed by muslim insurgents last month, at the beginning of a spasm of violence that has sent 430,000 muslim rohingya fleeing to bangladesh. the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) insurgent group denied killing the hindus saying it did not attack civilians. the latest violence in western myanmar s rakhine state began on aug. 25 when arsa militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing a sweeping government offensive in the north of rakhine state in response to those attacks.  the government of buddhist majority myanmar has said more than 400 people have been killed, most of them insurgents. it rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it is fighting  terrorists. members of the small hindu minority appear to have been caught in the middle. some have fled to bangladesh, complaining of violence against them by soldiers or buddhist vigilantes. others have complained of being attacked by the insurgents on suspicion of being government spies. the government said a search was mounted near ye baw kya village in the north of rakhine state after a refugee in bangladesh contacted a hindu community leader in myanmar. the refugee said about 300 arsa militants had marched about 100 people out of the village on aug. 25 and killed them.  twenty of the dead were female and eight were male children,  the government said.  they forced eight female villagers to convert to the islamic religion and took them to bangladesh,  the government said. a government spokesman, zaw htay, said the security forces were investigating. access to the area by journalists as well as human rights workers and aid workers is largely restricted and reuters could not independently verify the report. an arsa spokesman said he believed buddhist nationalists trying to divide hindus and muslims were behind the  lies  that arsa militants had killed the villagers.  arsa has internationally pledged not to target civilians and that remains unchanged no matter what,  the spokesman, who is based in a neighboring country and identified himself only as abdullah, told reuters through a messaging service. the violence in rakhine state and the exodus of refugees is the biggest crisis the government of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced since it came to power last year as part of a transition away from nearly 50 years of harsh military rule. bangladesh and aid organizations are struggling to help the rohingya refugees there, while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the north of rakhine state, where rights groups say nearly half of all muslim villages have been torched. the united states and the united nations have called for an end to the violence, unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone and for the right of those who have fled to go home safely.      suu kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. the chairman of the association of south east asian nations (asean), of which myanmar is a member, issued a statement urging all parties to avoid worsening the situation on the ground and calling for a  viable and long term solutions to the root causes of the conflict . muslim majority indonesia and malaysia have expressed concern about the situation, with malaysia in particular being critical of myanmar. in a rare show of disagreement in the 10 member grouping, foreign minister anifah aman later said malaysia disassociated itself from the statement as it misrepresented the  reality of the situation  and did not identify the rohingya as one of the affected communities. myanmar objects to the term rohingya, saying the muslims of rakhine state are not a distinct ethnic group but illegal immigrants from bangladesh.  this month, malaysia summoned myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over the violence in myanmar. it also  expressed grave concerns over such atrocities which have unleashed a full scale humanitarian crisis .

" vietnam has found faults with the central state bank of vietnam, including poor supervision of credit organizations and inefficiency in preventing corruption, the government said on saturday. the announcement, which was published on the government s website, came amid an intensifying crackdown on corruption that has pushed many state executives and government officials into the spotlight. the government inspectorate found the bank slow and not complying with regulations when publicizing its properties and revenues, the report said, without elaborating.  government officials have to reveal their incomes and properties to the public. inspectors also pointed out violations by sbv s banking supervision agency, a department in charge of overseeing and examining credit organizations, from 2010 to 2015.   credit organizations had several faults but during inspection, the supervising department did not promptly detect them to deal with and prevent them,  the government said. the inspectorate has called for the state bank governor to investigate groups and individuals behind the violations.  vietnam s crackdown on corruption and mismanagement, with a focus on inefficient state owned companies, earlier led to the rare dismissal of a member of the politburo and the sacking of a vice minister. four more officials from a scandal hit state oil firm are being prosecuted over links to investment losses in a local bank.

"as one of the most approachable presidents in history, president donald trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo. he s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture. as soon as the photo hit the internet, everyone noticed one shocking thing in it.the photo looks like every other fan shot out there, with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president. however, it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s.elijah and gianna lucas live in fresno, california but were in washington, d.c. on monday to attend a ceremony in honor of national peace officers  memorial day. like thousands of others, they sat in the crowd and listened to our commander-in-chief speak about the importance of police work in america and the sacrifice it often is, which has gone without recognition for eight years under barack obama. trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well, many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty.while obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it, trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name. this means more to elijah and gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father, who died while on duty on october 31, 2016. president trump holds fresno county sheriff s sgt. rod lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with lucas  children, elijah and gianna lucas, at the capitol in washington, d.c.i don t recall obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed, let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children. he did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims.what s seen in this shot of the president with fresno officer sgt. rod lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the trump had to be a part of this day for them, to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on october 31, 2016. they were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck lucas in the chest,  breitbart reports.  investigators determined no foul play was involved. rather, lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was  having a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired . in years past during police week, families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president. now that trump is in office, he s more than making up for that lost time under obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home, feel that they aren t forgotten.in an incredible moment at the same event on monday, held in front of the u.s. capitol in d.c., trump turned his speech to a 6-year-old boy named micah, who he saw in the audience. micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in phoenix, arizona. trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium, which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it.until trump took office, the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime. whenever a cop was killed, the past president wouldn t have even addressed it. however, that era officially ended on monday when trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying,  i want you to know that patriotic americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton crushed rival bernie sanders at the south carolina primary on saturday, propelling her into next week’s crucial “super tuesday” voting in 11 states on a wave of momentum. the rout of sanders solidified clinton’s status as the strong front runner to capture the party’s nomination for the nov. 8 election in her quest to become america’s first woman president. with nearly half of the votes counted in south carolina, clinton led sanders by a 50 point margin, dramatically reversing her 28 point loss in the state to president barack obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. the former secretary of state’s victory decisively  established her strength among black voters, a crucial democratic constituency who make up more than half of the party’s primary electorate in south carolina. after the win, clinton appeared to be looking ahead to a general election matchup with republican front runner donald trump, the billionaire whose campaign slogan is “make america great again” and has called for building a wall on the border with mexico. “despite what you hear, we don’t need to make america great again, america has never stopped being great,” she told cheering supporters in columbia after the win. “instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers.” the result was clinton’s third victory in the first four democratic contests, and raised more questions about whether sanders, the democratic socialist u.s. senator from vermont, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. “today you sent a message,” clinton said. “in america, when we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break.” sanders admitted defeat early in the night. “let me be clear on one thing tonight. this campaign is just beginning. we won a decisive victory in new hampshire. she won a decisive victory in south carolina. now it’s on to super tuesday,” sanders said in a statement.              the democratic race now becomes a broader national contest. eleven states, including six in the south with large minority populations where polls show clinton with big leads, will vote on super tuesday and four more over the next weekend. “tomorrow, this campaign goes national,” clinton said. clinton’s camp was hoping a big win in south carolina, after more narrow victories in iowa and nevada and sanders’ clear win in new hampshire, will set her up for a big night on tuesday, when about 875 delegates will be up for grabs, more than one third of those needed to win the nomination. sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and brought young people to the polls with his message of attacking income equality and reining in wall street, needs a breakthrough win in a key state in the next few weeks to keep his hopes alive. “the door is closing fast for bernie sanders,” unaligned democratic strategist chris kofinis said. “movement candidates are about momentum and excitement, and losses sap that momentum. that’s his problem right now.”      recognizing his steep odds in south carolina, sanders had spent most of the past week in states that will vote in march. as the results rolled in on saturday, he was scheduled to hold a rally in the “super tuesday” state of minnesota.

" president donald trump’s commission investigating voter fraud may request voter roll data from u.s. states, a federal judge ruled on monday, in a setback for groups that contend the effort could infringe on privacy rights. the judge said a lawsuit by the electronic privacy information center (epic) watchdog did not have grounds for an injunction in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  washington based u.s. district judge colleen kollar kotelly also pointed out that the commission was an advisory body that does not have legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the united states. trump, who set up the commission by executive order on may 12, has charged without evidence that millions voted unlawfully in the november presidential election.  republican trump won the electoral college, which tallies wins in states and determines the presidential winner. but he lost the popular vote to his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. “we look forward to continuing to work with state election leaders to gather information and identify opportunities to improve election integrity,” the commission’s vice chair kris kobach said in a statement after monday’s ruling. kobach is the secretary of state for kansas and a high profile advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification. civil rights groups and democratic lawmakers have said the commission could lead to new id requirements and other measures making it harder to vote. the panel, chaired by vice president mike pence, met for the first time last week. it ran headlong into controversy when kobach asked states to turn over voter information. the data included names, the last four digits of social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. some states refused, and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data.  the american civil liberties union has filed a separate lawsuit against the commission to ensure that it follows open government laws. “the commission’s efforts to gather personal data should not escape judicial review,” epic’s senior counsel alan butler said in a statement, adding the group would closely watch what the commission does next.

" cameroon has broken international law by forcibly deporting at least 100,000 nigerians who had fled there to escape islamist boko haram militants, human rights watch (hrw) said on wednesday. cameroon s minister of communications declined to comment on the report, which said the army had been detaining the refugees and torturing some of them, before the authorities pushed them back into neighboring northeast nigeria. human rights watch said the expulsions reported since 2015 were one of the largest illegal forced repatriations it had seen in recent years, and were in  flagrant breach  of global and cameroonian law. boko haram militants have killed tens of thousands in their fight to carve out an islamist state in northeast nigeria. the violence has forced hundreds of thousands to flee, many across the border into cameroon, chad and niger.      cameroon s army has been aggressively screening newly arriving nigerians at the border, subjecting some to torture and other forms of abuse, and containing them in far flung and under serviced border villages,  the report said.  this policy of blocking asylum seekers from accessing protection has made it easier for cameroon to deport them,  it said, adding that the u.n. refugee agency (unhcr) has been denied access. the unhcr said the report was broadly in line with its own understanding of the situation, though it could not confirm all the details in the paper.  forced returns in any context are of serious concern to us and in the case of cameroon and nigeria we have raised these concerns repeatedly and publicly,  said a unhcr spokesman. cameroon signed a treaty in march with nigeria and the unhcr to ensure that all refugee returns are voluntary but the rights group said cameroon s violations had continued.  they humiliated us like animals and beat us like we were slaves,  the report quoted one refugee as saying. his brother died from the resulting internal bleeding, he added. some deportees, including children, were so malnourished or sick they did not survive their return to nigeria, said hrw. nigeria is struggling to cope with millions of people dependent on emergency relief for food, shelter and medicine, victims of an eight year conflict in which at least 20,000 have been killed. at least 10.7 million people are in need of assistance in the region, mainly in nigeria but also in chad, niger and cameroon, according to the united nations.

" the u.s. embassy in liberia on wednesday defended the credibility of last month s presidential election there, amid allegations of irregularities and fraud that have delayed a run off poll. first round winner george weah, a former international football star, was initially set to face the runner up, vice president joseph boakai, last week to determine who will replace current term limited president ellen johnson sirleaf.  but the third place finisher, charles brumskine, contested the outcome of the first round, claiming gross irregularities had occurred and accusing nec officials of fraud, an allegation the body denies.  no accredited liberian, regional, or international observation group suggested that the cumulative anomalies observed reflect systemic issues sufficient to undermine the fundamental integrity of the electoral process,  the u.s. embassy said in a statement.   liberia s supreme court ordered the elections commission to fully examine brumskine s allegations last week, a decision likely to push back the run off date by weeks and even creates the possibility of the first round being re run. a number of first round candidates, including boakai, have publicly backed brumskine s challenge to the results and echoed his fraud allegations.  the dispute led johnson sirleaf, a nobel peace prize winner, to state in a radio address following the supreme court decision that liberia s democracy was  under threat , without elaborating.  efforts by any actors to impede the expressed will of liberia s people for personal ambition could risk goodwill and future investments in liberia by international partners,  the u.s. statement warned.   liberia, africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847, and maintains a special relationship with the united states. the west african timber and rubber producer is still trying to heal the wounds of one of the continent s most brutal civil wars, which ended nearly 15 years ago. a successful vote would be its first democratic transfer of power in more than seven decades.

" an indian court on thursday sentenced to death two men convicted of involvement in india s most deadly bombings, a series of blasts in the city of mumbai that killed 257 people in 1993, while two others were jailed for life. investigators said the bombs were ordered by india s most wanted man, gangster dawood ibrahim, to avenge the demolition of the historic babri mosque in north india by hindu hardliners in 1992, during a period of religious conflict. ibrahim is believed to be hiding in pakistan. pakistan denies that. the court sentenced feroz abdul rashid khan and taher merchant to death, while abu salem and karimullah khan were jailed for life, a lawyer for the federal police, deepak salvi, told reporters. a fifth man, riyaz siddiqui, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, salvi said. lawyers for the convicted men did not answer their telephones, and it was not immediately known if they would appeal against the sentences. legal proceedings against those accused of being involved in the bombings have resulted in more than 100 convictions, most of which are still winding their way through the legal system because of appeals and commutations of sentences. one suspect in the case, yakub memon, was hanged in 2015. in june, a court had ruled the five guilty of involvement in the blasts that shook india s financial hub more than two decades ago. a six man also found guilty at that time died in prison before sentencing.

" a suicide bomber blew himself up at a checkpoint near the main cricket stadium in the afghan capital kabul on wednesday, killing at least three people as a tournament was under way, officials said. interior ministry spokesman najib danesh said two police and one civilian were killed and five people wounded. local tolo news television quoted the afghan cricket board as saying all players were safe. the blast outside kabul international cricket stadium took place during a match in afghanistan s shpageeza cricket league, a t20 franchise tournament on the lines of the indian premier league and similar 20 over tournaments. a statement in bosnian on islamic state s amaq news agency said a suicide attack had been carried out on members of the afghan security forces in kabul ,  although it was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to the same incident. the shpageeza tournament, now in its fifth season, is one of a small number of western style sports competitions along with afghan premier league football that have grown up since a u.s. led campaign toppled the taliban in 2001. a small number of foreign players are also taking part in the competition. cricket, which spread from refugee camps in pakistan, has become one of afghanistan s most popular sports and the national team has become increasingly successful, raising the profile of the game.

" the german government has approved the sale of three thyssenkrupp submarines to israel and will provide financial support for the purchase, government spokesman steffen seibert told a regular news conference on monday. the estimated $2 billion deal is under police investigation  in israel over suspected corruption and several public officials and private citizens have been questioned in the case. the 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that prime minister benjamin netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented thyssenkrup marine system s local agent, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. the attorney has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with netanyahu. israel s justice ministry said in february that netanyahu himself was not a suspect. addressing israel s parliament, netanyahu told opposition lawmakers that the new deal with germany helped vindicate him.   how sad for you, that you have been staking your hopes on recycling the submarines story, but also understand that this story, too, has been sunk,  he said.  seibert said germany would make a contribution of up to 540 million euros to help finance israel s purchase. seibert said an inter governmental memorandum of understanding approving the deal would be signed later on monday.  i would like to thank (german) chancellor (angela) merkel and her government for this memorandum, which touches on a matter that is very important for israel s national security,  netanyahu said in his speech.

" mylan nl chief executive officer heather bresch will appear at a sept. 21 congressional hearing over price increases for its epipen emergency allergy treatment, the u.s. house of representatives oversight committee said in a statement on wednesday. mylan has been widely criticized, including by u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, for sharply raising the price of epipens, which are carried by people with life threatening allergies. mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of epipen auto injectors to $600. the price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008.  mylan spokeswoman nina devlin confirmed that bresch will attend the hearing. “heather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information,” said evercore isi analyst umer raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the committee.  a probe into epipen pricing by a u.s. senate subcommittee was announced on sept. 7. bresch is the daughter of u.s. senator joe manchin, a democrat from west virginia. the house panel co chairmen, republican representative jason chaffetz and democratic representative elijah cummings, noted there is “... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of epipens.” the committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the epipen market and speed approval by the food and drug administration (fda) of generic alternatives, according to the statement. in response to the furor, mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of epipen for $300. teva pharmaceutical industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to epipen, said last week that it hopes to gain u.s. approval by late 2017 or early 20018. epipen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto injected devices. the committee said it also planned to call as a witness dr doug throckmorton, the fda’s deputy director at the center for drug evaluation and research.

" the european union has suspended funding for cambodia s 2018 general election because the vote cannot be credible after the dissolution of the main opposition party, according to a letter sent to the national election committee on tuesday. the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) was dissolved by the country s highest court last month at the request of the government of prime minister hun sen after the arrest of opposition leader kem sokha for alleged treason.  an electoral process from which the main opposition party has been arbitrarily excluded cannot be seen as legitimate,  the letter said.  under these circumstances, the european union does not believe there is a possibility of a credible electoral process.  some western donors have condemned the cnrp dissolution as the most serious blow to democracy since an international peace deal and u.n. run elections in the early 1990s ended decades of war and the khmer rouge genocide that killed at least 1.8 million cambodians in the 1970s. a government spokesman said the eu decision would not affect the election, in which hun sen is expected to extend more than three decades in office that make him the world s longest serving prime minister.  this is their will,  spokesman phay siphan told reuters on tuesday.  we have our own money.   the european union and japan are the biggest donors to cambodia s election commission, which is in theory independent. asked if japan would also suspend aid for the election, the japanese embassy said it would continue to give assistance for electoral reform and would monitor the situation closely.  it is of utmost importance to have next year s national election reflect the will of the cambodian people,  hironori suzuki, a counselor at the embassy, told reuters by email. the united states last month said it would suspend funding for the election. it later said it would impose visa sanctions on those involved in the government s actions to undermine democracy.  kem sokha, leader of the cnrp, was arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with u.s. help. he has rejected the accusation as a political ploy. the european union in october warned cambodia it could face eu action over duty free access it enjoys under a deal for some of the world s poorest countries if the nation s human rights situation deteriorates further. cambodia s biggest donor and investor is now china, which has voiced support for the opposition crackdown, saying it supports government efforts to ensure stability and economic development.

" u.s. senator ted cruz of texas is getting a taste of the “new york values” he derided in iowa as republicans turn to the next big u.s. presidential contest in the home state of front runner donald trump. the new york billionaire lost the wisconsin republican primary on tuesday to cruz and is seeking to rebound in new york on april 19. he won the backing on thursday of former new york mayor rudy giuliani, who was irked by cruz’s values comments. “it’s new york city. we’re family. i can make fun of new york but you can’t,” giuliani, who led the city through the trauma of the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, told the new york post. “i support trump. i’m gonna vote for trump,” he said. ohio governor john kasich, running third in the republican race, chimed in with an ad called “values,” part of a seven figure ad buy in new york and pennsylvania, which votes on april 26. “new yorkers aren’t stupid and they certainly won’t fall for ted cruz’s lame soliloquies and flattery after he slammed their values,” said kasich spokeswoman connie wehrkamp. trump canceled a friday trip to california to focus on new york. he turned on cruz wednesday night during his first rally in the state since the double digit loss in wisconsin. “i’ve got this guy standing over there, looking at me, talking about new york values with scorn in his face, with hated, with hatred of new york,” trump said, drawing a chorus of boos. cruz credited his feb. 1 iowa caucuses victory in part to  his attacks on trump’s “new york values.” he told abc on thursday the phrase referred to the state’s liberal democrats. cruz took another hit in the bronx, where a group of high school students protesting his stance on immigration threatened a walkout if their principal did not cancel his appearance. “most of us are immigrants or come from immigrant backgrounds. ted cruz goes against everything our school stands for,” destiny domeneck, 16, told the new york daily news. school authorities complied, the newspaper reported on thursday.

" president donald trump will be presented with multiple options regarding the future of the iran nuclear deal ahead of an oct. 15 deadline to certify whether tehran is complying with the pact, secretary of state rex tillerson said on wednesday. tillerson did not disclose details about the kinds of options he will present to trump. he also declined to directly answer a question about whether he shared defense secretary jim mattis  assessment to congress on tuesday that iran was  fundamentally  in compliance with the accord.  we ll have a recommendation for the president. we re going to give him a couple of options of how to move forward to advance the important policy toward iran,  tillerson told reporters at the state department. a collapse of the 2015 deal, which trump has called  an embarrassment,  but which is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran, could trigger a regional arms race and stoke middle east tensions. a senior u.s. official said last month that trump was leaning toward not certifying that iran is complying with the pact. trump himself has said he already had made up his mind whether to keep the pact, but has declined to disclose his decision. if trump declines to certify iran s compliance, u.s. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran suspended under the accord. unlike mattis, who publicly suggested trump should consider sticking with the agreement, tillerson has been highly critical of the accord and said it must be changed. he has taken aim at the deal s so called sunset clauses, under which some of the restrictions on iran s nuclear program expire over time. tillerson on wednesday suggested that whatever path the united states chooses on the nuclear accord known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), it would only represent one component of america s broader policy toward iran.  the jcpoa represents only a small part of the many issues that we need to deal with when it comes to the iranian relationship,  he said.  so it is an important part of that, but is not the only part. and i ve said many times, we cannot let the iranian relationship be defined solely by that nuclear agreement.

" president donald trump signed an executive order on friday initiating a government wide review of the u.s. defense industry and suggest changes to strengthen it. the review is intended to identify and address potential weak points in the defense manufacturing base including  companies that could go out of business and leave gaps in the supply chain for u.s. weapons systems, said peter navarro, the white house national trade council director. the executive order asked for recommendations on possible  legislative, regulatory and policy changes that would improve and support the defense industry, calling it a “significant national priority”. “america’s defense industrial base is now facing increasing gaps in its capabilities,” navarro said. “there’s just one company in the u.s. that can repair propellers for navy submarines,” he added in a briefing with reporters. defense analyst howard rubel of the investment bank jefferies & co said the free market has so far done a reasonably good job. “we don’t want to invest in buggy whip suppliers just because there is only one (supplier).” he added that it is important to recognize that the united states can sometimes buy more cheaply from its allies. the review mandated by the executive order will be led by the pentagon and conducted in concert with the department of labor and the department of homeland security as well as other government agencies. skilled labor is also a big part of the huge military buildup trump has promised to project american power. industry has already shown initiative in addressing the skilled labor shortage, including in the metals trades, navarro said in his remarks.

" north korea’s nuclear threat looms large this week over the annual gathering of world leaders at the united nations in new york, where diplomats are eager to hear u.s. president donald trump address the 193 member body for the first time.  north korean diplomats will have a front row seat in the u.n. general assembly for trump’s speech on tuesday morning, which will touch on the escalating crisis that has seen trump and pyongyang trade threats of military action.  despite his skepticism about the value of international organizations and the united nations in particular, trump will seek support for tough measures against north korea, while pressing his “america first” message to the world body. “this is not an issue between the united states and north korea. this is an issue between the world and north korea,” trump’s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, said on friday. u.n. secretary general antonio guterres   who, like trump, took office in january   plans to meet separately with “concerned parties,” including north korean foreign minister ri yong ho, on the sidelines of the 72nd general assembly. “the solution can only be political. military action could cause devastation on a scale that would take generations to overcome,” guterres warned on wednesday.  a week ago, the 15 member u.n. security council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over north korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said u.n. sanctions had banned 90 percent of the asian state’s publicly reported exports, saying of pyongyang on friday: “this is totally in their hands on how they respond.” haley told cnn’s “state of the union” program on sunday that washington had “pretty much exhausted” its options on north korea at the security council. ri is due to address the general assembly on friday. some leaders will also push trump not to give up on a 2015 deal curbing iran’s nuclear ambitions in return for a lifting of u.n., u.s. and european sanctions, while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said it was time to “fix it   or cancel it.” the foreign ministers of iran, the united states, britain, germany, russia, china and france   the parties to the agreement   are due to meet on wednesday ahead of an october deadline for trump to tell congress if he believes tehran is sticking to what he has described as “the worst deal ever negotiated.” when asked on friday what moscow’s message would be for washington, russia’s u.n. ambassador, vassily nebenzia, said: “stay in the jcpoa (the nuclear deal).” a senior u.n. security council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “we are faced with real uncertainties with respect to north korea and it’s a bit dangerous ... to add another source of uncertainty with respect to iran.” iran’s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on sunday his country would not be bullied by the united states and would react strongly to any “wrong move” by washington on the nuclear deal.  iran and north korea will also feature heavily during a ministerial security council meeting on thursday, at the request of the united states, to discuss the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  while leaders and diplomats are also due to meet on longer running crises including libya, syria, south sudan, mali, central african republic, yemen and iraq, a last minute addition has been myanmar, where the united nations has branded violence against rohingya muslims as “ethnic cleansing.”  britain is due to host a ministerial meeting on monday to seek a way to get myanmar authorities to end a military offensive in the country’s rakhine state that has sent more than 400,000 minority rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh. following trump’s announcement that the united states would withdraw from a landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, several high level gatherings are planned on the sidelines of the general assembly to bolster the deal. “climate change is a serious threat,” guterres told reporters. “hurricanes and floods around the world remind us that extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and severe, due to climate change.” u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson appeared to hold the door open for the united states to remain in the paris climate accord “under the right conditions.” “the president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,” tillerson said on cbs’ “face the nation” program on sunday.  trump will seek to boost support for reforming the united nations, which he once called “a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” the united states is the largest u.n. contributor and trump has complained that washington pays too much. “the united nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it’s run more efficiently and effectively,” mcmaster said on friday.

" the republican national committee spokesman sean spicer will serve as u.s. president elect donald trump’s press secretary in the white house when he takes office next month, trump announced on thursday. to round out his communications team, the president elect  appointed loyalists from his upstart presidential campaign. hope hicks, trump’s sole spokeswoman when he began what was considered a longshot candidacy in june 2015, will be director of strategic communications. jason miller was appointed director of communications and dan scavino was named director of social media. spicer, 45, served as rnc spokesman during trump’s presidential campaign, alongside party chairman reince priebus, who stood by trump amid furious opposition from establishment republicans and was rewarded with the chief of staff position. acerbic and professional, spicer, a navy reserve commander, has been openly critical of media coverage of republican candidates and the president elect, but insists the future u.s. leader has a high regard for press freedom. “we understand and respect the role that the press plays in a democracy. it is healthy, it’s important. but it’s a two way street,” spicer told politico recently, before bashing the news outlet for what he said was exclusively negative coverage. spicer, who has been a spokesman for the trump transition team, has a long background in public affairs. he led a turnaround in the rnc’s public affairs operation after taking over as communications director in 2011. he beefed up social media operations, built an in house tv production team and created a rapid response effort to reply to attacks. spicer worked in president george w. bush’s administration as the assistant u.s. trade representative for media and public affairs. before that, he was communications director for the republican conference in the u.s. house of representatives. spicer has tried to reassure news organizations that trump will not try to ban them from covering him, as the president elect sometimes sought to do during the election campaign. but spicer and other trump aides have indicated the new president would shake up the status quo in white house dealings with the media, including re examining the need for daily televised news briefings and the practice of assigned seating in the briefing room. “i think we have to look at everything,” spicer told fox news when asked about the briefings. “and so i don’t know that it needs to be daily. i don’t know that they all need to be on camera.”  ",0
" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on sunday: aides to trump attack the credibility of the nonpartisan agency that will analyze the costs of a replacement for obamacare, as the white house seeks to quell opposition from many conservative republicans. two days before u.s. attorney preet bharara was fired, trump tried to call the high profile new york prosecutor in what a white house official says was an effort to “thank him for his service and to wish him good luck.” german chancellor angela merkel is controlled and cautious, a physicist from east germany who takes her time making decisions and has never relished the attention that comes from being europe’s most powerful leader. trump is a wealthy real estate magnate from new york who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight. on tuesday, they meet for the first time. when trump unveils his budget for the 2018 fiscal year on thursday, conservative republicans will be cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup. but more moderate republicans are less enthusiastic and worry they could be forced to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly. white house economic adviser gary cohn says the federal reserve “has been doing a good job” and the trump administration respects its independence, even if the u.s. central bank raises interest rates this week.

" mexico said on tuesday the trans pacific partnership (tpp) could form the basis for bilateral trade deals between signatories, and saw a bigger role for china on world trade after u.s. president elect donald trump vowed to withdraw from the accord. on monday, trump set out plans for his first day in office, including withdrawing from tpp. he called it a “potential disaster” for the united states, which he argues has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs due to poor trade policy. mexico’s economy minister ildefonso guajardo, who has just returned from meetings with policymakers at the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit in lima, said if washington stepped back from free trade, it would open the door to china. “if one power exits a space, you can bet another will step in,” he told reporters at an event in mexico city. chinese president xi jinping also attended the apec meeting, where he told the world “here we are” on free trade and pledged to keep opening its economy to other countries, guajardo said. mexico has said it wants to press ahead with tpp regardless of whether the united states ratifies the 12 nation accord signed in february, though guajardo said the existing agreement could form the basis for bilateral deals. the minister also said mexico could weigh the merits of the china backed regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep), a rival pact that excludes the united states. “mexico has to have a means of integrating itself with the asia pacific (region),” guajardo said. trump has also threatened to ditch the north american free trade agreement (nafta) between mexico, united states and canada, raising pressure on mexico to reduce dependency on the united states, where it sends 80 percent of its goods exports. latin america’s second biggest economy runs a sizeable trade deficit with asia’s main trading nations, especially china. however, the government could face resistance from mexican manufacturers to opening up to china, as the two countries compete directly in many sectors to export to the united states.

" the head of the u.s. senate’s armed services committee, john mccain, has proposed $7.5 billion of new military funding for u.s. forces and their allies in the asia pacific, where tensions have been rising over china’s territorial ambitions. the funds, $1.5 billion a year for five years to 2022, could be used to boost u.s. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and to help allies and partner countries increase their capabilities, an aide to mccain and a u.s. military official said. the funding proposal was contained in a white paper issued by mccain last week entitled “restoring american power.” his committee is expected to discuss it at a budget hearing on tuesday. “senator mccain believes the united states must sustain its enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of the asia pacific region,” a spokesman for mccain, dustin walker, said.  “the asia pacific stability initiative ... would ... make u.s. regional posture more forward learning, flexible, resilient, and formidable,” he said. “these funds would boost operational military construction, increase munitions procurement, enhance capacity building with allies and partners, and expand military exercises and other training activities.” an official in the administration of new u.s. president donald trump, who took office on friday, said he believed mccain’s proposal was “very much in general alignment with the administration’s goals in the region.”  trump has vowed to take a tougher line with china and to build up the u.s. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of “sequestration” legislation. a u.s. military official, who did not want to be identified, said the funds could go to construct new military runways in countries such as australia and the philippines and to make up a shortfall of munitions that the head of the u.s. pacific command, admiral harry harris, complained of last year. “there’s a shortfall in the total number of munitions and also a quality gap,” the official said, adding that more sophisticated missiles were needed in the region to counter china’s “anti access, area denial” strategy.  on monday, the new u.s. administration raised the prospect of worsening tensions with china when it vowed to prevent beijing from taking over territory in international waters in the south china sea, something chinese state media has warned would require washington to “wage war.” ",0

" members of colombia’s marxist farc guerrillas will meet u.s. secretary of state john kerry in cuba, a spokeswoman for colombia’s government peace negotiators said on sunday, adding a twist to a historic visit to the island by u.s. president barack obama. the meeting with kerry on monday will be the first time a u.s. secretary of state has met the negotiators from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, who have been talking peace with the colombian government in havana for more than three years. “at around 4 p.m. (2000 gmt), the meeting between kerry and the farc delegation will take place,” after the colombian government delegation meet him, the spokeswoman said. a source at colombia’s office of the high commissioner for peace said the rebels and colombian government negotiators would also go to an exhibition game between major league baseball’s tampa bay rays and cuba’s national team on tuesday. that game will be attended by obama, who on sunday became the first sitting u.s. president to visit cuba in nearly 90 years. but farc negotiator pastor alape said he was not aware of an invitation to attend the baseball game. he said that before meeting with kerry, the rebels would meet the u.s. special envoy for colombian peace talks, bernard aronson, to agree on an agenda.  the united states sees the colombian peace talks hosted in havana as an example of how restoring normal relations with cuba can help its wider goals in latin america. latin america’s longest war has killed some 220,000 people and displaced millions of others since 1964. the government and rebels are attempting to reach a deal that would be placed before colombian voters for approval, with a u.n. mission supervising rebel disarmament.  colombian president juan manuel santos and farc leader  rodrigo londono, better known by the nom de guerre timochenko, had set a self imposed march 23 deadline to reach a comprehensive pact but have since conceded that goal may not be reached. washington designated the farc as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, and many of its leaders have been indicted in the united states on charges of cocaine trafficking.

" myanmar wants to continue working with the united nations on human rights but its investigator must be fair, the foreign ministry said on thursday, a day after special rapporteur yanghee lee was barred from visiting the country.  myanmar is still cooperating with the special rapporteur mechanism,  said ministry of foreign affairs spokesman kyaw moe tun.  but ms yanghee lee s undertakings don t have impartiality and objectivity,  he said, adding that myanmar had asked the united nations to replace her with someone who knows myanmar well and is both fair and impartial. lee had been due to visit myanmar next month to assess human rights across the country, including alleged abuses against rohingya muslims in rakhine state, but on wednesday she said she    had been barred from visiting for the rest of her tenure. she called for stronger international pressure to be exerted on myanmar s military and said in a statement that the ban suggested something  terribly awful  was happening in the country. more than 650,000 rohingya have fled into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by muslim insurgents on the myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping counter offensive by the army and buddhist vigilantes.  surveys of rohingya refugees in bangladesh by aid agency medecins sans frontieres have shown at least 6,700 rohingya were killed in rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on aug 25, the aid group said last week. the u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place.  myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing, blaming most of the violence and torching of rohingya villages on the rohingya insurgents who attacked the security forces. lee had planned to use her visit to find out procedures for the return of rohingya refugees, and to investigate increased fighting in kachin state and shan state in northern myanmar, where the army is battling autonomy seeking ethnic minority insurgents. kyaw moe tun, who is director general of the foreign ministry s international organizations and economic department, said a statement released by lee after her last visit in july  was not objective and not impartial .  if she comes again and does that, it is not easy to cooperate with us and have a positive attitude,  he said. lee said in july that activists and journalists continued to be followed and questioned by state surveillance agents, and that her visit was beset by official snooping and access restrictions. the office of myanmar leader aung san suu kyi said at the time that it was  disappointed  with lee s end of mission statement, which contained  many sweeping allegations and a number of factual errors . it did not give any details and did not directly address the issues of access or surveillance.

" china said on thursday it had the right to bar people from hong kong, a day after a british activist was denied entry to the former british colony, and that it had complained to britain after it demanded an explanation. hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. but critics have accused the government of bending to the will of communist party leaders in beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest. british foreign secretary boris johnson said he was  very concerned  that benedict rogers, a co founder of the conservative party s human rights commission, was denied entry to hong kong on wednesday and demanded an  urgent explanation  from hong kong and china. it came a week before a sensitive communist party leadership meeting starts in beijing. johnson also said hong kong s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were  central to its way of life . rogers has been a vocal critic of china ruled hong kong s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader joshua wong. he believes the decision to bar him was made by chinese officials after the chinese embassy in london had warned him earlier, through a british member of parliament, that he wouldn t be allowed in. chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to hong kong.  the central chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,  hua said.  allowing or not allowing people in is china s sovereignty ... hong kong affairs are a purely internal matter for china.  she said china had lodged a solemn representation with britain, meaning an official complaint. when asked about the incident on a radio talk show, hong kong leader carrie lam agreed.   ultimately, under the basic law (hong kong s mini constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,  lam said.  asked if immigration controls fell under hong kong jurisdiction, lam said:  it has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.  if you say everything falls under hong kong s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the basic law says.  rogers, speaking to reuters shortly after arriving in london, said beijing s statement confirmed his assumption that the decision to boot him out was made not by hong kong but by chinese authorities. he described the interference in hong kong s immigration controls as  very alarming  and  a very serious threat to  one country, two systems .   china has now revealed its hand. the world ought to have woken up a long time ago, but i think now they really ought to wake up to what this means for  one country, two systems ,  he said.  i m very sad for what this means for hong kong.  the former head of hong kong s civil service turned pro democracy activist, anson chan, said the case was a  serious breach  of the basic law. article 154 of the basic law says hong kong  may apply immigration controls on entry  of foreigners into hong kong.  the immigration department must have sought instructions from on high,  she told reuters.  they (beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on hong kong ... you will not be allowed in.  amnesty international s east asia director, nicholas bequelin, suggested china s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into hong kong.   in china if you re critical of the political system, you re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing  one country, two systems  should protect against.  in response to a reuters  request for comment on whether china was involved in rogers  denial of entry, hong kong s immigration department said it did not comment on individual cases. china has admitted asking a group of british mps to cancel a visit to hong kong in 2014 during the massive pro democracy protests, of which joshua wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days. hong kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 tiananmen square protests in beijing and a danish sculptor, jens galschiot, who made a tiananmen sculpture.

" the mayor of stockton, california, was arrested on thursday on a felony eavesdropping charge stemming from a strip poker game he is accused of surreptitiously recording at a summer camp he hosts for disadvantaged inner city children, prosecutors said. mayor anthony ray silva, 41, was also charged with three misdemeanor counts   contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child endangerment and furnishing alcoholic beverages to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. silva is accused of using his cellphone to make an audio recording of conversation among several young people, including a 16 year old boy, who were playing strip poker with the mayor inside his cabin at the camp. prosecutors said in a media statement it was evident that the participants, who were naked, were recorded against their will. amador county district attorney todd riebe said those present besides the mayor included two to three females and three males, all ranging in age from 18 to 20. the criminal complaint further accuses silva of supplying alcohol to six underage youths. prosecutors said some were camp counselors. the incidents, according to prosecutors, took place last august at the stockton silver lake camp in amador county, which lies in california gold country on the edge of the sierras northeast of stockton. in addition to hosting unprivileged children at the city leased camp each summer, silva has served as president of the boys & girls clubs of stockton for the past six years. silva’s lawyer, mark reichel, told reuters his client “will be vindicated” and suggested the case was politically motivated, noting that the mayor, a republican, faces a tough election run off in november against a democratic city councilman. asked whether silva was playing strip poker with youths from his camp, reichel replied, “i highly doubt it.” reichel added, “i can’t wait to fight them in court, so we can expose the epidemic of kids at summer camp playing strip poker.” silva was elected mayor of stockton, a city of about 300,000 east of san francisco, in november 2012, months after the municipality filed for bankruptcy. the city emerged from bankruptcy protection in february 2015. silva, who is not married, was arrested by fbi agents thursday morning at the camp and released on $20,000 bond later in the day.  his next court date is aug. 18. if convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison.

" ukrainian officials, security monitors and kiev s foreign backers warned on wednesday that moscow s decision to withdraw from a ukrainian russian ceasefire control group could worsen the fighting in eastern ukraine. on monday, the russian foreign ministry said it was recalling officers serving at the joint centre for control and coordination (jccc) in ukraine, accusing the ukrainian side of obstructing their work and limiting access to the front line. ukrainian defence minister stepan poltorak and security chief olekshandr turchynov said the decision, coupled with a recent surge in fighting in the eastern donbass region, suggested russia had switched to a more offensive strategy.  we cannot rule out that they withdrew their officers in order to start stepping up not only military provocations but also military operations,   turchynov said.  we will strengthen our positions at the front.   the ukrainian armed forces are currently prepared for a change in the situation,  poltorak told journalists. a russia backed separatist insurgency erupted in 2014 and the bloodshed has continued despite a ceasefire that was meant to end the conflict. more than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near daily basis. a spokesman for the organisation for security and co operation in europe, which works with the jccc to monitor the much violated minsk peace agreement, said:   we are concerned about any step that might lead to a further deterioration of the security situation in the region, affecting both the smm (osce special monitoring mission) and the civilian population.   fighting between ukrainian troops and separatists has climbed to the worst level in months, the osce said this week, after the shelling of a frontline village wounded civilians and destroyed or damaged dozens of homes. russia denies accusations from ukraine and nato it supports the rebels with troops and weapons, but the u.s. envoy to peace talks, kurt volker, said moscow was answerable for the violence.   russia withdrew its officers from jccc   a ceasefire implementation tool   right before a massive escalation in ceasefire violations. ukraine just suffered some of the worst fighting since february, 2017. decision for peace lies with russia,  volker tweeted on tuesday. germany and france, which have spearheaded international efforts to resolve the conflict, expressed concern. a germany foreign ministry spokesman said  it could have severe consequences for civilians in the conflict zones.   we call on the russian authorities to reconsider this decision and hope that the ukrainian authorities will guarantee access to ukrainian territory to russian representatives of the joint center (jccc),  said alexandre giorgini, deputy spokesman for the french foreign ministry. created in 2014, the jccc is made up of ukrainian and russian officers, who are meant to work together to ensure the safety of osce monitors and help implement the minsk ceasefire.

" two years after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across paris, france officially ended a state of emergency, replacing it with the introduction of a new security law which critics say undermines civil liberties. the new anti terrorism law, effective from wednesday, gives police extended powers to search properties, conduct electronic eavesdropping and shut mosques or other locations suspected of preaching hatred.  some dread that now that we are out the state of emergency there could be a drop in vigilance, it is the opposite,  french prime minister edouard philippe told journalists during a short visit to police officers guarding the eiffel tower in paris.  the level of threat is high everywhere in the world,  he said, referring to the attack in new york on tuesday where a pickup truck driver killed eight people. the new legislation transposes some of the measures contained in the state of emergency rule into law, although with some modifications. one measure will allow the interior ministry, without approval from a judge, to set up large security perimeters in case of an identified threat, restricting movement of people and vehicles and with power to carry out searches inside the area. conservative politicians warn the regulations are not going far enough while human rights groups and members of the left fear police misconduct.  france has become so addicted to the state of emergency that it is now injecting several of these abusive measures into ordinary law,  human rights watch said before parliament backed the legislation last month. france s human rights watchdog, an independent body, has said it is concerned about breaches of rights of muslims. the french council of the muslim faith, the official interlocutor with the state in the regulation of muslim religious activities, said it would remain vigilant about the bill s implementation. however, the concerns expressed by such rights groups have had little resonance with the public so far. a poll conducted in early october showed more than 80 percent of support for the bill. the government says the state of emergency has helped intelligence agencies to thwart more than 30 attacks.  president emmanuel macron said on tuesday islamist militancy remained the biggest security threat to france.

" there were stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members only, jacket and tie clubs and fundraisers at the four seasons, the st. regis and the mandarin oriental.      in the world of jeb bush, the campaign for the 2016 republican presidential nomination has at times been a whirl of private planes and high end affairs, according to the federal filings of bush’s campaign and his super pac, right to rise, which can raise unlimited funds for bush as long as it does not coordinate directly with him.  it is not unusual for u.s. presidential candidates to fly private or even sometimes stay in luxury hotels. but some disgruntled donors say they are unhappy with bush’s large outlays, which also include big spending on staff and tens of millions of dollars in ad buys.  eleven of 16 major donors contacted by reuters questioned whether it was money well spent, especially given how the one time frontrunner has stumbled badly in the polls and is now facing questions about whether he should withdraw from the race.   in contrast to bush, senator ted cruz, who is running second in national polls of republican voters, favors cheaper accommodation options like holiday inn and often flies on budget carriers, campaign finance filings through the third quarter show.  several members of the bush camp vigorously rejected the donor critiques. bush spokeswoman kristy campbell said, “we are running a national campaign that is competing everywhere and we have made investments that have allowed us to do what serious campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections.”  ad tracking firm smg delta says bush’s campaign and right to rise have spent $82 million on ads, significantly more than the three leading candidates in the republican race: donald trump ($5 million); senator ted cruz ($11 million) and senator marco rubio ($49 million). the tracking firm’s data is more up to date than what has been reported so far in the federal filings.  “there is no return on investment on the bush ad buys, zero,” said one high dollar donor who asked not to be named, pointing to how the ads have done little, at least so far, to lift bush in the polls or dent his opponents.  on sunday, donors will learn just how much bush has spent from his $100 million plus war chest. that’s when republican and democratic candidates and their super pacs release their latest campaign finance reports. what is known so far is that bush and right to rise spent at least $82 million, both in operating expenditures through the third quarter of 2015 and on ad spending through this month.    the campaign finance reports also show that between june 2015, when bush formally announced his candidacy, and september, the bush campaign spent $1.2 million on private planes versus the roughly $700,000 spent during the same period by democratic frontrunner hillary clinton.      cruz spent $158,000 on private planes, and rubio $293,300. trump flies around the country in his own boeing 757.       the former florida governor’s spending pattern illustrates the limits of campaign donations: even in an era when candidates can receive unlimited sums from wealthy donors, money doesn’t guarantee success.      “they are burning money,” said a second major donor, who, like all the other high dollar donors interviewed, asked not be named for fear of displeasing the bush family.  “look, this is not the election cycle to be spending like a silver spoon establishment candidate,” said a third donor. “it just doesn’t look right,” the donor said, referring to the way income inequality has emerged as a key theme in the 2016 election.  ambassador jeanne phillips, a member of the right to rise governance committee, laughed off the criticism.  “i’ve known jeb for 30 years, so the idea that jeb would allow anyone around him to be frivolous with money is hilarious, it’s ridiculous. the man is the most conservative, fiscally responsible person i’ve ever worked with.”  bush’s campaign committee paid for all lodging on the campaign trail and the vast majority of private air charter, while right to rise paid for nearly all the known ad spending.      money donated by both large and small donors kept the bush camp traveling in style. there were stays at luxury hotels including the wilshire in beverly hills, the viceroy in florida, the st. regis in dana point, california, and the w in stamford, connecticut, the campaign finance filings show.  the filings do not offer a complete picture. it is not clear for example, how many nights were spent at each of the hotels or indeed whether it was bush himself who stayed or staff members.  bush isn’t the only candidate spending at high end hotels, but it’s a high proportion of his overall hotel spending. he spent $125,000,or 70 percent of his total hotel spending between june and september on hotels defined as luxury or “upper upscale” luxury hotels by str global, which tracks supply and demand data in the hotel industry.  cruz and rubio each spent less on luxury hotels and a smaller proportion of their overall lodging expenses on them, at roughly 56 percent and 61 percent, respectively, federal filings through the third quarter show. trump flies home nearly every night so he can sleep in his own bed.      the bush campaign and his super pac also spent more than $400,000 on renting facilities and catering at posh venues, including the union league club and the upscale beachfront 1 hotel south beach in miami, where the super pac spent $60,000 last year. rubio and cruz spent roughly $265,000 and $185,000 respectively.      bush defenders said the spending on high end venues was simply how the donor world operated.  “if you can hold an event at a fancy hotel and raise millions, then it’s well worth holding it at a swanky hotel” said charlie spies, counsel for right to rise.  spies said right to rise had negotiated “below market” rates with vendors and consultants, including an overall compensation cap for staff.        nevertheless the bush camp has spent more on staff and consultants than any of the leading candidates. starting roughly in the spring, bush paid out about $8 million. cruz spent just $2 million; rubio, just under $2 million; and trump, $1.7 million.  overall, trump, cruz, and rubio have spent a small fraction of the $82 million bush has reported paying out. cruz spent $18.5 million and rubio outlayed $32 million, according to the filings made so far.  bush is certainly not the only candidate to spend big on the trail. wisconsin governor scott walker, for instance, ran an expensive campaign and burned through nearly $10 million before quitting after three months.      bush’s prospects were far brighter last summer. trump had yet to join the race and bush was making headlines for the size of his war chest. his super pac had just cracked its goal of raising more than $100 million in just six months — an unprecedented haul in american politics.      to celebrate, jeb’s parents and family welcomed their large network of well heeled donors to their oceanside compound in kennebunkport, maine, where attendees were treated to rides in private trolley cars, lobster rolls and group photos with the sprawling bush clan.  (this version of the story was refiled to clarify spending in paragraph 25 to show it was by both the campaign and super pac)  ",0

" president elect donald trump accepts the u.s. intelligence community’s conclusion that russia engaged in cyber attacks during the u.s. presidential election and may take action in response, his incoming chief of staff said on sunday. reince priebus said trump believed russia was behind the intrusions into the democratic party organizations, although priebus did not clarify whether the president elect agreed that the hacks were directed by russian president vladimir putin.  “he accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in russia, so that’s not the issue,” priebus said on “fox news sunday.” it was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the republican president elect’s team that trump had accepted that russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election.  trump had rebuffed allegations that russia was behind the hacks or was trying to help him win, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by china or a 400 pound hacker on his bed. with less than two weeks until his jan. 20 inauguration, trump has come under increasing pressure from fellow republicans to accept intelligence community findings on russian hacking and other attempts by moscow to influence the nov. 8 election. a crucial test of republican support for trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks.  a u.s. intelligence report last week said putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and support trump. the report, commissioned by democratic president barack obama in december, concluded vote tallies were not affected by russian interference, but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the vote in other ways. after receiving a briefing on friday from leaders of the u.s. intelligence agencies, trump did not refer specifically to russia’s role in the presidential campaign. in a statement, he acknowledged that “russia, china, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the democrat(ic) national committee.” trump spokesman sean spicer told reuters the president elect’s conclusions remained the same and that priebus’ comments were in line with friday’s statement. priebus’ wording did not appear to foreshadow the dramatic reversal of trump’s apparent russia policy that experts say would be required to deter further cyber attacks. “it will take a lot more than what we heard on television today to make putin cool it,” the expert added. “in fact, there may not be anything that can deter putin from pursuing a course he’s bet his future and russia’s on,” said a u.s. intelligence expert on russia, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic political positions. the expert added that putin’s “multifaceted campaign of cyber attacks and espionage, propaganda, financial leverage, fake news and traditional espionage” had expanded in the united states since the election, “and it will be a shock if it does not escalate in france, germany and elsewhere this year.” priebus, the former republican national committee chairman trump tapped as white house chief of staff, said trump planned to order the intelligence community to make recommendations as to what should be done. “action may be taken,” he said, adding there was nothing wrong with trying to have a good relationship with russia and other countries. two senior republican senators urged trump to punish russia in response to u.s. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the election. appearing on nbc’s “meet the press,” senators lindsey graham and john mccain said evidence was conclusive that putin sought to influence the election   a point that trump has refuted. “in a couple weeks, donald trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy,” graham said. “you should let everybody know in america, republicans and democrats, that you’re going to make russia pay a price for trying to interfere.” on saturday, trump wrote on twitter that having a better relationship with russia was a “good thing.” u.s. representative devin nunes, the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee, said three u.s. presidents had tried and failed to be friends with putin. “i’m just not sure it’s possible,” nunes said on the “fox news sunday” program. “i’ve cautioned his administration to be careful with putin, as he remains a bad actor.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell agreed it was not unusual for a new president to want to get along with the russians. he added on cbs, however, that the russians remained a “big adversary, and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election.” obama, who himself tried to “reset” relations with russia after he took office in 2009, told nbc he did not think he had underestimated the russian president. “but i think that i underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that i think are accelerating,” he said in an interview with “meet the press” broadcast on sunday.

" the republican controlled texas senate gave preliminary approval on tuesday to a bill that restricts bathroom access for transgender people, endorsing a piece of legislation denounced by civil liberties advocates as discriminatory. final senate adoption of the bill was possible later on tuesday or wednesday. the measure would then be sent to the state house of representatives, where passage during a 30 day special legislative session that ends in mid august is less certain despite a republican majority in that body as well. the preliminary vote in the senate was 21 10, with one democrat crossing the aisle to vote with the republican majority in favor of the measure, senate bill 3. enactment in texas, the most populous republican dominated state, could give momentum in other socially conservative states for additional action on an issue that has become a flashpoint in the u.s. culture wars. the texas measure requires that all restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities “must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a person’s birth certificate,” as opposed to their gender identity. the measure also would overturn local ordinances affirming transgender bathroom rights in such cities as austin, san antonio and dallas.  supporters, including republican lieutenant governor dan patrick, a staunch social conservative, have said the proposed bathroom restrictions promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children. momentum for so called bathroom bills stalled earlier this year when a similar law in north carolina was partially repealed in march. the original law prompted boycotts by a number of athletic organizations and businesses that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. opponents in texas warned of a similar backlash. “the state of texas cannot afford discriminatory acts,” democratic senator borris miles said during debate on the bill. the bill’s sponsor, republican senator lois kolkhorst, said there was no solid evidence showing that enacting the bill would hurt the state’s economy. “perhaps we will find that this one bill will lead to more economic activity,” she said. business leaders, socially progressive clergy and police chiefs of several major texas cities have called on lawmakers to halt the bathroom bill, saying it does not protect the public. civil rights groups said there were already laws on the books protecting people from sexual assaults and voyeurism, and that enactment of sb 3 would further endanger transgender people, who are more prone to be victims of violence. the texas senate previously passed a bathroom bill during the regular legislative session that ended in may, but the measure died in the house, under pressure from pro business republicans. texas house speaker joe straus, a moderate republican who steers that chamber’s agenda, has said such measures are unnecessary and raise worries of economic harm.

" republicans in the u.s. house of representatives on friday introduced a measure intended to prevent gun sales to people on government watch lists, only to draw demands from democrats for stronger proposals and a warning of possible new protests. a week after democrats ended a 25 hour sit in on the house floor to call for gun legislation after the june 12 mass shooting in orlando, florida, house majority leader kevin mccarthy, a republican, said lawmakers will vote next week on a measure giving government authorities three days to convince a judge that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. “it is a responsible measure that confronts this threat while protecting the rights of law abiding citizens,” house speaker paul ryan said in a statement. but in a friday conference call, house democrats reached “a clear consensus” to oppose the measure, calling it the handiwork of the national rifle association, an aide said. similar legislation, backed by the nra, was blocked by democrats in the senate last week.  democrats also called for two amendments: one to allow the u.s. attorney general to decide without court approval whether someone on a watch list could buy a gun and another to expand existing background checks to all commercial gun sales including those at guns shows. democratic representatives john lewis of georgia and john larson of connecticut, who led last week’s sit in, asked for a meeting with ryan to request votes on the amendments, which consist of legislation originally sponsored by republican peter king of new york. ryan agreed to meet with the democrats next tuesday, republican and democratic aides said. “if these amendments are not allowed, then members will have further discussions about possible actions to take in response to this refusal to allow a vote on commonsense gun legislation,” said another house democratic aide. ashlee strong, a ryan spokeswoman, said the house speaker “looks forward to meeting with congressmen lewis and larson to discuss the important action the house will take to prevent terrorist attacks.” the new republican proposal, which would apply to anyone who has been suspected of violent extremism within the past five years, would require authorities to show probable cause that a would be buyer “will commit an act of terrorism” or violates existing prohibitions on undocumented immigrants, fugitives, convicts and people with mental illness. the gun provisions were tucked into a bill aimed at stepping up efforts against terrorism, including what the legislation referred to as “radical islamist terrorism.” some republicans have criticized democrats for avoiding such terms to describe events like the orlando shooting, where a gunman pledging allegiance to islamic state killed 49 people last month. donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, said recently that president barack obama should resign for not having used “radical islam” in a statement responding to the orlando massacre, in which police identified the shooter as a u.s. citizen born in new york to afghan immigrants. the nra said it was reviewing the legislation, while the brady campaign to prevent gun violence said the legislation proposed by house republicans was a publicity stunt.

" the powerful former leader of mexico s largest teacher s union, elba esther gordillo, will be let out of jail under house arrest more than four years after her detention on embezzlement charges, government and judicial sources said on friday. gordillo, 72, was unexpectedly arrested in 2013 in the first year of president enrique pena nieto s government, in what appeared to show the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) taking a stand against corruption. but the attorney general (pgr) this week stopped fighting gordillo s lawyer s attempts to get her out of prison, and a tribunal approved, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. the judicial source said that in a matter of hours or days she would be allowed to go home. the decision to let gordillo see out her trial under house arrest came as the political party she founded, the new political alliance party (panal), said it would back the pri in the 2018 election.

" u.s. president elect donald trump on friday said he was considering imposing a lifetime ban on u.s. military procurement officials going to work for defense contractors, a move that could dramatically reshape the defense industry. three days after publicly rebuking boeing co over the cost of the next generation air force one presidential aircraft, trump floated the idea of such a ban at a rally for republican supporters in baton rouge, louisiana. “i think anybody that gives out these big contracts should never ever, during their lifetime, be allowed to work for a defense company, for a company that makes that product,” trump said. “i don’t know, it makes sense to me.” he added that he “got the idea yesterday” as he thought about “massive” cost overruns for military equipment but needed to “check this out” first before making any decisions. trump said such a ban would make “a big, big difference because the purchasing in this country is out of control, for everything, not only military.” the president elect’s idea was met with deep skepticism within the u.s. defense establishment procurement and weapons program management jobs have long been a good alternative career path within the pentagon for military officers who did not win coveted command jobs. a u.s. defense official, speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity, said such a ban would likely discourage people from taking procurement jobs in the pentagon and cause more attrition. “the reason a lot of people go in and stay in is because it makes for a nice transition later to a civilian job. it could make people want to avoid that,” the official said after being asked about trump’s announcement. current rules prohibit pentagon employees from working on the same acquisition matter in the private sector, said andrew hunter, a former pentagon official now at the center of strategic and international studies, a washington think tank. but an industry wide ban on hiring former pentagon officials could backfire badly, he said. “no one is going to want to take those jobs. you’re going to have the worst of the worst, because no one with any particular talent is going to want a career where they are going to be banned for life for doing what they were trained to do,” said hunter, who is director of the center’s defense industrial initiatives group. congressional aides also told reuters they were skeptical that such a ban could be enacted. trump singled out lockheed martin’s f 35 stealth fighter jet program for criticism at the louisiana rally, saying it was “totally, totally, like, uncontrollably over budget.” the f 35 is the pentagon’s costliest arms program. the defense department expects to spend $391 billion to develop the plane and buy 2,443 of the supersonic, stealthy new warplanes in the coming decades. costs per plane are expected to fall below $100 million as production ramps up.

" the white house said in a letter on friday that a tweet by president donald trump on thursday was the formal answer to a request by the house of representatives intelligence committee for information about records of conversations with fired fbi director james comey. the letter to republican representative mike conaway, who is leading the panel’s investigation into russian interference to the 2016 election, and representative adam schiff, the committee’s top democrat, said: “in response to the committee’s inquiry, we refer you to president trump’s june 22, 2017, statement regarding this matter.” the house panel said on june 9 it had written to don mcgahn, the white house counsel, asking about the existence of any recordings or memos covering comey’s conversations with trump and asked that copies of the materials be provided to the panel by june 23. trump wrote on twitter on thursday, a day before the deadline, that he did not know if there were recordings of his conversations with comey, but he did not make or have any such recordings. conaway told reporters friday morning that trump’s tweet was not a sufficient response. schiff said in a statement on thursday that trump’s twitter comment stopped short of denying the white house had tapes or recordings and said the white house must respond in writing.

" republicans in congress unveiled a fiscal 2018 budget plan as a first step to major u.s. tax reform on tuesday, only to face the same divisions between conservatives and moderates that helped killed their efforts to replace obamacare.   the $4 trillion spending blueprint, released by the house of representatives budget committee, could become a new flashpoint for republican in fighting because it links future tax cuts for businesses and individuals with $203 billion in mandatory spending cuts that would reduce benefits for the poor. the republican push to repeal and replace the affordable care act, widely known as obamacare, collapsed in the senate late on monday after a tug of war between party moderates who wanted to preserve healthcare benefits for lower income americans and conservatives who wanted to scale them back. on tuesday, house republicans disagreed over the budget proposal in terms that could foreshadow a replay of the senate healthcare debacle when lawmakers turn to tax reform. representative mark meadows, chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, said the budget measure would not get enough conservative votes to pass the house without bigger cuts to programs that the government is required to fund by law. “it’s still short of what it needs,” meadows told reporters. on the other side, representative charlie dent, a leader of the moderate tuesday group, called for an agreement with democrats to establish higher spending levels for discretionary programs. “if we move too much in the mandatory area, then it will make tax reform that much more difficult to get. it’s that basic,” dent told reuters. house and senate approval for a fiscal 2018 budget agreement would unlock a vital legislative tool called reconciliation that allows republicans to pass tax legislation in the senate with a simple majority. but the senate’s inability to pass healthcare legislation   even with reconciliation raised questions about how useful the strategy really is.  one corporate lobbyist said some senate republicans privately question the reconciliation approach backed by house leaders, saying it appears to be “poisoning the well” in the senate by alienating democrats who might otherwise support tax legislation.  republicans have only a 52 48 senate majority and can afford to lose no more than two votes on republican only legislation, with vice president mike pence providing the tie breaking vote. democrats were delighted by the republicans’ failure on healthcare and called for bipartisan discussions. “using a partisan approach for the major issues of our time — healthcare and tax reform – is a prescription for trouble,” senator ron wyden, top democrat on the senate finance committee, said at a tax reform hearing on tuesday. senator orrin hatch, the panel’s republican chairman, acknowledged that republicans would also have difficulty passing tax reform legislation, even using reconciliation.  “it’s going to be difficult to do. hopefully, we can get that done,” hatch told reporters.  the senate is under no obligation to accept the house budget language that would ultimately tie tax reform to mandatory spending cuts in the same piece of legislation. senator john thune, chairman of the senate republican conference, said senators will decide whether to add the same language to their own budget resolution. after six months in power, president donald trump has yet to score a major legislative victory, though financial markets have rallied since his election on expectations of pro business measures, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. pence, speaking to a gathering of retailers in washington on tuesday, reiterated that trump plans to slash the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. but the failure of the healthcare bill in the senate created uncertainty in financial markets, with the dollar hitting its lowest level against the euro in more than a year on tuesday. “the healthcare bill not coming through raises some continued concerns about the ability of washington to push through favorable fiscal policies,” said lisa kopp, head of traditional investments at u.s. bank wealth management. the s&p 500 stock market index has gained about 15 percent since trump’s nov. 8 election, while the benchmark dow jones industrial average has posted one record high after another on optimism of a trump tax reform and other pro business policies. the budget committee will hold a hearing on the budget resolution on wednesday. representative diane black, the panel’s chair, said the measure has the votes to reach the house floor.

" president donald trump plans to nominate j. christopher giancarlo to lead the commodity futures trading commission, the regulator tasked with policing the massive over the counter derivatives market, the white house said on tuesday. giancarlo, a republican, has been acting chairman of the cftc since jan. 20 and was widely expected to be tapped for the permanent position of chairman. he became a cftc commissioner in 2014. the nomination comes just one day before giancarlo is expected to give a major policy address at the annual futures industry association conference in boca raton, florida, where he plans to lay out his regulatory vision for the agency. the cftc won broad new powers from the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law to regulate the swaps market, which until then had been largely unpoliced. giancarlo previously served as executive vice president of financial services group gfi group inc. throughout his tenure as a cftc commissioner, giancarlo has been critical of the way the agency has implemented many of the new rules required by dodd frank. he issued a white paper in 2015, for instance, which accused the cftc’s regulatory framework of driving global traders away from the united states, fragmenting the marketplace and increasing liquidity risk. he has dissented on a number of other major policy areas, including a proposal requiring automated traders to hand over sensitive code without a subpoena   something giancarlo said “would strip owners of intellectual property of due process of law.” as chairman, giancarlo is likely to focus his energy on scaling back rules that he believes are overly burdensome to help boost economic growth   a vision that is also shared by jay clayton, trump’s pick to head the cftc’s sister regulator, the securities and exchange commission. in a speech monday before the institute of international bankers, giancarlo criticized those who have dwelled heavily on preventing a repeat of the financial crisis, saying the impact has been to “sideline capital from productive uses.” if confirmed as chairman, however, giancarlo could face some initial challenges getting his agenda adopted. currently, the five member panel is down to two commissioners   giancarlo and sharon bowen, a democrat. if the two disagree on a decision, the measure cannot pass.  giancarlo acknowledged this challenge in his speech monday, saying the agency cannot proceed on a controversial position limits rule without a full commission.  trump has not yet nominated anyone for the remaining three positions.

" germany s social democrats (spd) agreed to open exploratory talks on forming a government with chancellor angela merkel, party leader martin schulz said, providing a chance to end a rare period of political deadlock in europe s largest economy. the decision is a painful about face for the center left party, whose members fear it risks losing its identity and sustaining further electoral defeats if it signs up for another  grand coalition  with merkel s conservatives. the spd, merkel s junior coalition partner since 2013, was punished by voters in september with its worst election result since world war two. it initially planned to go into opposition, but was persuaded to consider a new coalition after merkel failed to form a three way government with two smaller parties. schulz said the spd had a responsibility to consider backing the government to contribute to germany s stability. but he promised party faithful he would take a new approach to keep the spd s identity stronger in coalition than previously. he would strive for a  different kind of governing culture  in which ministers communicated more directly with citizens, and demand more healthcare and education spending.  we won t just keep doing as we ve been doing now and there won t be a continuation of the grand coalition we ve had until now in the form that we knew it.  merkel welcomed the spd s decision during a speech at a congress of the csu, the arch conservative bavarian sister party of her christian democrats, in nuremburg. she urged quick action on forming a stable government, 11 weeks after the vote.  i have great respect for this decision when i look at the path the social democrats have taken since sept. 24,  she said.  we have a huge responsibility to form a stable government.  merkel, who met with french president emmanuel macron in brussels on friday, said germany needed to ensure its ability to work with france to strengthen the european union.  a coalition with the spd is merkel s only realistic chance of securing a fourth term in office without a new election,    after both her conservatives and the spd suffered punishing losses in september. spd leaders hope to sell the about face to skittish members by forcing merkel s conservatives to concede a raft of popular worker friendly measures in exchange for their support, either for a coalition or a minority government. schulz said talks would not begin in earnest before early january. party members must still ratify any plan to return to government, meaning a final result could still be months away, even as much of the continent looks to germany for leadership on euro zone governance reform and security policy. the spd s desire to extract meaningful concessions could slow things further, particularly if the parties seek common ground on immigration. the spd wants to retain the right for successful asylum seekers to bring their families to germany, but merkel s conservative bavarian allies, fearing defeat in regional elections next year, are equally adamant it should be scrapped. a poll for ard television showed that 61 percent of voters would support a renewed  grand coalition  between the conservatives and the spd.

" the british and scottish executives have made progress in talks on how to share powers after brexit, they said on monday, but edinburgh still objects to the central government s proposed law on withdrawing from the european union. scotland, which has a semi autonomous parliament and executive with powers over specific policy areas, has been seeking assurances from the united kingdom s central government over the status of those powers after brexit. the sides held talks in london on monday along with representatives of wales, which also has devolved institutions.  we have been able to make some progress, including agreeing general principles that should ensure the role of the scottish parliament in any potential uk  or gb wide frameworks,  said michael russell, scotland s brexit minister, after the talks. the british government s minister for scotland, david mundell, said the parties had moved in a positive direction.  we have taken a major step today by agreeing a set of principles on how we will move forward with the powers returning to the uk from brussels,  he said. but russell also said that the scottish executive, which is run by the scottish national party, still objected to the conservative british government s proposed eu withdrawal bill currently making its way through the uk s central parliament. the bill, a pillar of the central government s strategy for delivering an orderly brexit, is designed to convert all existing eu laws into domestic ones so that there is clarity after the separation occurs in march 2019. but it has raised hackles in edinburgh and cardiff, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, because it does not make clear what the status of those devolved powers will be after brexit.  we remain unable to recommend the scottish parliament consent to the eu withdrawal bill as currently drafted and will not be able to do so until the power grab is removed from the bill,  said russell.  i have and will continue to press for the amendments suggested by ourselves and the welsh government to be accepted, removing the power grab and providing a clear solution that respects devolution.  under britain s constitution, the uk parliament must seek consent from the scottish and welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap with their devolved powers.  while edinburgh and cardiff do not have veto powers over the brexit bill, ignoring their wishes would mark a new low in already tetchy relations with london. that could give an incentive to the uk government to incorporate at least some of the scottish and welsh amendments to avoid the embarrassment of a constitutional clash.

" indian prime minister narendra modi called for a closer security relationship between his country and the united states on wednesday, in an address to the u.s. congress stressing the importance of warming ties between the two countries. he dedicated much of the speech to the importance of fighting terrorism, thanking congress for u.s. support after a pakistan based military group’s rampage in mumbai killed 166 people in 2008. “the fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. and the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight,” modi told a rare joint meeting of the senate and house of representatives. “we have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it. the need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation,” modi said. he leavened the speech to lawmakers, the first such address by an international leader since pope francis’ in september, with jokes about congress’ bitter partisan divide and yoga. but modi used it to make serious points about india’s neighbor and arch rival pakistan and regional concerns about chinese expansionism. “i commend the members of the u.s. congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains,” he said, not mentioning either country by name.     modi is on the u.s. leg of an international tour. on tuesday, he met with president barack obama at the white house, where the two leaders said india agreed to work toward joining the paris agreement on climate change this year and discussed security and cyber security issues. the visit, two years after modi became prime minister, capped an improving relationship between new delhi and the united states. before he was elected, modi was barred from even entering the country because of concerns about his handling of 2002 riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly muslims. today, he is one of the international leaders most popular in washington, where modi’s government is seen as a counterbalance to china. he and obama have a warm personal relationship. “we are now standing shoulder to shoulder in ways that no one could have imagined a generation ago,” representative eliot engel, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, said at a reception for modi after the address.  in a 45 minute speech interrupted by cheers and at least eight standing ovations, the 65 year old indian leader said deeper u.s. indian security cooperation should isolate anyone who harbors, supports or sponsors terrorists. although he did not mention pakistan, that line was greeted with applause from the lawmakers, many of whom are increasingly frustrated with what they see as islamabad’s failure to crack down on militants behind attacks on american troops in afghanistan. modi also stressed that india is committed to helping rebuild a peaceful and stable afghanistan. amid heightened tensions over china’s assertive pursuit of territory in the south china sea, modi said a stronger u.s. india partnership could boost peace and prosperity “from asia to africa and from the indian ocean to the pacific.” he did not mention china. “it can also help ensure security of the sea lanes and commerce and freedom of navigation on seas,” modi added. democrats leaped to their feet when modi referred to the recent climate change summit. but republicans in the house chamber remained seated, reflecting the u.s. political divide over the issue. house speaker paul ryan greeted modi at his office before his speech. after the indian leader’s remarks, he attended lunch with congressional leaders and a reception with members of the house foreign affairs and senate foreign relations committees.

" philippine president rodrigo duterte s honeymoon period may be over, but his deadly anti drugs campaign will not wane, his office said on monday, after a fall in ratings that his opponents said showed public disillusionment with his rule. duterte has enjoyed strong opinion poll numbers since winning the presidency in last year s elections but heavy scrutiny of his war on drugs, which has killed thousands of filipinos, appears to have impacted his ratings. trust and satisfaction in duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall.  the honeymoon period of the president is usually for a year, so this is expected,  duterte s communications secretary, martin andanar, said in a radio interview, adding it should motivate the government to deliver on its overall objectives.  the social weather stations survey was conducted between september 23 27, two days after thousands of filipinos rallied to denounce duterte s drugs war and his authoritarian leadership style. the high death toll has stoked international alarm, although domestic polls have shown filipinos are largely supportive of his tough measures to fight crime and drugs. police say they have killed 3,900 drug suspects during their anti narcotics operations and deny executions have taken place, as human rights groups have alleged. but the campaign has been under the microscope of late, due largely to the high profile killing by police of a 17 year old student on aug. 16, which led to a senate probe. a murder investigation is under way.  police said he was a drug suspect killed because he opened fire on them while resisting arrest, but security camera footage showed him in police custody. his family insists he was executed. staunch critics of duterte were quick to take advantage of a survey slump they said reflected public discontent and scepticism about his drugs war.    it s very encouraging to know that the filipino people are beginning to see the light,  said senator antonio trillanes, a fierce opponent who has recently accused duterte of concealing assets when he was davao city mayor.   they are now seeing duterte for who he really is: a lying, rude, amoral, corrupt and oppressive former mayor who is totally incompetent about governance at the national level.  presidential spokesman ernesto abella also said the honeymoon was over, but duterte was not motivated by popularity ratings and was  bent on making sure that he addresses the three campaign themes which is crime, corruption and illegal drugs . duterte s office frequently cites polls, including sws, as a sign of his public support. peace and order are also one of the cornerstones of the 72 year old leader s economic agenda, which aims to lift the country s growth to 7 8 percent during his six year term.    senator risa hontiveros said the ratings dip showed duterte s  authoritarian style of governance is losing its appeal and support .  the writing on the wall is simple and clear: president duterte cannot govern based on fear, lies and killings,  hontiveros said in a statement.

" pakistani police on monday exhumed the bodies of a young couple believed to have murdered by their families in a so called honor killing, an investigator said. zeeshan siddiqui said abdul hadi, 25, already married with three children, and his 21 year old cousin hussaini bibi ran away together a month ago and had yet to marry. the couple had settled in a rented house in the southern city of karachi.  their landlord informed the police after the couple went missing. the house had bloodstains and signs of murder.  questioning of their relatives led police to a graveyard where the bodies were exhumed, said the officer, who suspected the two families colluded in the killing.   honour killings  are mostly carried out by relatives over the perceived damage to their honor when a girl decides to marry someone of her choosing or refuses to marry someone her family would pick. the couple were from the kohistan tribal district of northwest pakistan. in 2012, four women and a girl were ordered to be killed by a tribal council in kohistan after a cell phone video of them dancing and singing apparently in a wedding became public.

" president barack obama made his first visit to a u.s. mosque on wednesday, in an effort to allay the fears of americans accustomed to pop culture portrayals of muslims as terrorists, and to reassure muslim american youth about their place in the nation. obama, declaring that attacks on islam were an attack on all religions, decried the “inexcusable political rhetoric” against muslims from donald trump and other republican presidential candidates. “we have to understand that an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths,” he said at the mosque outside of baltimore, which he said had received threats twice in the past year. “when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up.” trump, the republican front runner, called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states after authorities described a california couple who killed 14 people last december as radicalized muslims inspired by islamic state militants. obama’s visit was aimed at showing americans another side of islam. before he spoke, cub scouts who attend a school run by the mosque carried the american and maryland state flags into the prayer hall, a plain room save for a three rows of window panes, 99 in all, each depicting one of the names of allah in arabic. “think of your own church or synagogue or temple, and a mosque like this will be very familiar,” said obama, who, following islamic custom, took off his shoes to enter the hall. the children led the audience, with some men in prayer caps and most women in head scarves, in the pledge of allegiance. a man and a woman recited a verse from the koran about tolerance and inclusion. obama, a christian, outlined the tenets of islam, and gave a brief history of muslims in america. he noted that founding father thomas jefferson specifically mentioned muslims when he spoke about the american right to freedom of religion. “thomas jefferson’s opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a muslim, so i was not the first,” said obama, who has long been accused of secretly being a muslim, to a roar of laugher. “i’m in good company,” he said. obama asked a row of muslim american military service members to stand, as well as ibtihaj muhammad, a member of the u.s. fencing team who will be the first american olympian to compete in a hijab, or head scarf, in this year’s rio olympics. the president touched on pop culture depictions of muslims as terrorists. “our television shows should have some muslim characters that are unrelated to national security, obama said. turning to extremist groups such as islamic state and what he characterized as perverted versions of islam portrayed by them, obama urged regular muslims to “show who you are. to use a little christian expression   let your light shine.” later, he told a crowd of cheering children, who had packed the mosque’s gymnasium to watch his speech on large screens, that one day they too could become president. obama urged young muslims not to embrace a worldview that required them to choose between faith and patriotism. “you fit in here. right here,” he said. “you’re not muslim or american. you’re muslim and american.” ",0
" qatar s arab critics are targeting a new pressure point in their feud with doha   the tiny country s ruling family   permitting state linked media outlets to portray two little known qatari princes living abroad as distinguished statesmen.  the publicity, in which the two men are lauded by media in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as talented decision makers capable of solving the rift, is widely seen as a dig at the prestige of doha s current leadership. despite saudi arabia and the uae insisting they do not seek regime change, the publicity appears aimed at upping pressure on doha, which they accuse of long meddling in their own domestic affairs. saudi arabia, the uae, bahrain and egypt cut political and trade ties with qatar on june 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch foe iran   charges doha denies. the two men hailing from a branch of the ruling al thani family, silver haired sheikh abdullah bin ali based in london but now living in riyadh, and his younger nephew sheikh sultan bin suhaim, now feature regularly on saudi and uae channels. praising saudi king salman and his powerful son crown prince mohammed bin salman, they both called this week to convene a meeting of the qatari ruling family to  discuss the crisis.    because of the government s current policy that allowed hateful and bitter people to infiltrate qatar and to spread their poison everywhere, we have now reached the abyss,  sheikh sultan, based in paris, said in a statement carried by uae based sky news arabia tv. while the princes do not expressly present themselves as replacements to emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani, analysts believe their sudden prominence is designed to undermine him   an uphill task for men few qataris had heard of until recently.  for such a strategy to work, you need to find an alternative that already has a popular base,  said jean marc rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the geneva centre for security policy.  the move is eye catching because it appears to test a gulf taboo: while many gulf ruling families, including the al thani of qatar, have a record of palace intrigue, fellow dynasties in neighboring states rarely interfere in each other s internal family politics for fear of attracting intrusion in return.  the crisis has pressured qatar s economy, squeezing company revenues and forcing costly rerouting of trade and air transport that once ran easily through their neighbors  skies and waters. doha has responded by stepping up trade with turkey and iran, handing diplomatic gains to two countries with whom riyadh and its allies vie for regional influence. qatar s refusal to accede to 13 demands, including that it shutter popular news channel al jazeera, downgrade ties with tehran and expel islamist leaders from doha, may have driven its adversaries to train their sights on the ruling family.  an environment where qatar becomes a permanent partner for iran and turkey would be viewed as highly problematic for the leadership in riyadh and abu dhabi,  said ayham kamel of the eurasia group consultancy.  the arab quartet is still focused on pressuring qatar to concede on parts of the 13 demands, but qatari intransigence is encouraging these states to consider other options.

" qatar s foreign minister said on wednesday that his country was willing to negotiate an end to a gulf diplomatic rift but had seen no sign that saudi arabia and other countries imposing sanctions on doha were open to mediation. kuwait and the united states are trying to heal a bitter dispute between qatar and four arab countries that has damaged business ties and disrupted travel for thousands of citizens in the six nation gulf cooperation council. egypt, saudi arabia, bahrain and the united emirates severed political and trade ties with the small gas rich country on june 4, accusing it of supporting terrorism. doha denies the charges. a visit this week to the uae and qatar by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov showed no signs of having eased tensions among the gulf arab powers.  qatar maintains its position that this crisis can only be achieved through a constructive dialogue ... but the blockading counties are not responding to any efforts being conducted by kuwait or other friendly countries,  qatari foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani told reporters in doha on wednesday at a news conference with his russian counterpart.  the uae s ambassador to the united states, yousef al otaiba, in an interview with u.s. based magazine the atlantic on monday, said his country would negotiate with qatar so long as doha did not set any preconditions for talks. sheikh mohammed said on wednesday qatar planned to bolster trade with russia, one of the world s biggest gas exporters, and that qatar could no longer rely on neighboring states to support its economy or guarantee food security. lavrov said if face to face negotiations started, russia would be ready to contribute to the mediation and that it was in russia s interest  for the gcc to be united and strong .

" the united states suggested on tuesday it could cut u.s. aid to pakistan or downgrade islamabad s status as a major non nato ally to pressure the south asian nation to do more to help it with the war in afghanistan. a day after president donald trump committed to an open ended conflict in afghanistan and singled out pakistan for harboring afghan taliban insurgents and other militants, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said washington s relationship with pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism.  we are going to be conditioning our support for pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,  tillerson told reporters.  u.s. officials are frustrated by what they see as pakistan s reluctance to act against groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring afghanistan. pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting u.s. and afghan government forces in afghanistan. tillerson said the united states could consider withdrawing pakistan s status as a major non nato ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u.s. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve.  we have some leverage that s been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non nato alliance partner   all of that can be put on the table,  he said. in a televised speech on monday offering few specifics, trump promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government and he singled out pakistan for harboring militants. u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america s longest military conflict.   (for a graphic on u.s. troops and contractors in afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6cxq)  the afghan government welcomed trump s speech, but the taliban said it would make the country a  graveyard for the american empire.      successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan, which has a porous border with afghanistan. washington fumes about inaction against the taliban, but pakistan has cooperated on other u.s. counterterrorism efforts, including against al qaeda and islamic state militants. the pakistani foreign ministry said it was  disappointing that the us policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the pakistani nation  in fighting terrorism.   as a matter of policy, pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,  it said.      a senior u.s. official said on tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. trump also called for pakistan s great rival india to play a bigger role in afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for pakistan s generals.      trump s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,  said zahid hussain, a pakistani security analyst. the united states has little choice but to use pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan, giving islamabad considerable leverage. u.s. officials fret that if pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize afghanistan and endanger u.s. soldiers.     defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the u.s. military s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, general joseph dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to afghanistan.  when he brings that to me, i will determine how many more we need to send in,  mattis told reporters in baghdad.  it may or may not be the number that is bandied about.  u.s. officials have said trump has given mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in afghanistan. the u.s. air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following trump s decision, its top general told reuters on tuesday. most u.s. troops in afghanistan work with a nato led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al qaeda and islamic state fighters.

" u.s. customs & border protection (cbp) has informed u.s. airlines that they can once again board travelers who had been barred by an executive order last week, after it was blocked nationwide on friday by a federal judge in seattle, an airline official told reuters. in a conference call at around 9 p.m. est (0200 gmt), the u.s. agency told airlines to operate just as they had before the order, which temporarily had stopped refugees and nationals from seven muslim majority countries from entering the united states. individuals from those states who have proper visas can now board u.s. bound flights, and airlines are working to update their websites to reflect the change, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. the judge’s temporary restraining order represents a major challenge to u.s. president donald trump’s action, although his administration could still appeal the ruling and have the policy upheld. judge james robart, a george w. bush appointee, made his ruling effective immediately on friday, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted straight away. he is expected to issue a full written ruling over the weekend. cbp and washington based trade group airlines for america did not immediately comment.

" u.s. democratic senator al franken returned to congress on monday to begin what he called a process of rebuilding trust shattered by allegations he had groped or inappropriately touched women, vowing “this will not happen again.” “i know that i am going to have to be much more conscious when in these circumstances, much more careful, much more sensitive and that this will not happen again going forward,” he told reporters outside his office on capitol hill. franken has been accused of sexual misconduct by leann tweeden, a radio broadcaster who in 2006 appeared with franken in an entertainment tour for u.s. troops serving in war zones. prior to winning his senate seat, franken was a well known comedian, television writer and author. another woman, lindsay menz, accused franken of touching her buttocks when they were being photographed at the minnesota state fair in 2010. a contrite franken appeared on monday before a throng of reporters gathered outside his office as the senator vowed to get back to work following a week long senate thanksgiving break. “i know there are no magic words that i can say to regain your trust and i know that’s going to take time. i’m ready to start that process and it starts with going back to work today,” franken said, apparently addressing his minnesota constituents back home. franken, first elected in 2008, is not due to run for a third senate term until 2020. following sexual misconduct allegations against movie producer harvey weinstein, additional complaints have been made regarding other big names in entertainment and in politics, notably republican u.s. senate candidate roy moore of alabama,                                                                           and representative john conyers of michigan. all three men have denied the allegations, which reuters has not been able to verify, and conyers has stepped down as senior democrat on the house of representatives judiciary committee.    in november, 2008, franken barely won election in a race so close that it took vote recounts and court rulings before he finally was declared the winner the following july. because of the closeness of his race and his background in entertainment and not government service, franken came to the senate refusing most media interviews. he kept a low profile while he tried to demonstrate to constituents that he was serious about his new political career. eight years later, franken is again having to prove himself with minnesotans. noting that his supporters had “counted on me to be a champion for women,” franken again apologized for his behavior. in response to a reporter’s question, he said he would be “open” to making public the findings of a senate ethics probe once that process is complete.

" springer nature, which publishes science magazines nature and scientific american, said on wednesday it had pulled access to a small number of articles in china to comply with regulations, adding that it viewed the move as regrettable but necessary. the decision comes after britain s cambridge university press (cup) said in august it had removed from its website in china about 300 papers and book reviews published in the china quarterly journal, after a request from the chinese government. cup, the publishing arm of elite cambridge university, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles, following an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. in a statement, germany based springer nature said that less than one percent of its content had been  limited  in mainland china.  this action is deeply regrettable, but has been taken to prevent a much greater impact on our customers and authors,  it said.   this is not editorial censorship and does not affect the content we publish or make accessible elsewhere in the world. it is a local content access decision in china done to comply with specific local regulations,  it added. the financial times said at least 1,000 springer nature articles had been blocked in china, containing sensitive key words like taiwan, tibet and cultural revolution. under president xi jinping, beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and strengthened communist party authority over academia and other institutions. beijing said in september that chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products were legal. china s state council information office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours.  in not taking action we ran the very real risk of all of our content being blocked,  springer nature said.  we do not believe that it is in the interests of our authors, customers, or the wider scientific and academic community, or to the advancement of research, for us to be banned from distributing our content in china.  cambridge university press had said it had blocked articles on topics including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests, the 1960s cultural revolution and tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country.

" the russian foreign ministry said u.s. officials had broken into residences at russia s consulate in san francisco, and threatened retaliation over what it called an illegal act. russian staff left the consulate last month, after washington ordered moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties, part of a series of tit for tat actions during a thorny phase in bilateral relations. since then, u.s. officials had occupied administrative parts of the compound, but on monday they entered residential areas that the departing staff had locked, the ministry said in a statement late on monday.   despite our warnings, the u.s. authorities did not listen to reason and did not give up their illegal intentions,  it said.  we reserve the right to respond. the principle of reciprocity has always been and remains the cornerstone of diplomacy.   footage aired repeatedly on russian state television showed what the broadcaster said were u.s. officials breaking locks that had sealed off parts of the compound and entering the buildings. the  intruders  had taken over the whole premises including the consul general s residence, the ministry said.  therefore, we understand that americans, breaking into our diplomatic buildings, have de facto agreed that their missions in russia may be treated likewise.  a state department spokeswoman denied on tuesday that u.s. officials had broken into the residences, saying diplomatic security and representatives of the department s foreign missions office had walked through the spaces to ensure they had been vacated by an oct. 1 deadline. spokeswoman heather nauert said the united states had  graciously  given the russian government more time to leave the buildings after discovering they had families and individuals  living in this sort of office type space.   once we learned that, we then offered them extra time there to pack up their items and leave,  nauert said.  so we permitted them living in the apartments until oct. 1. and their time was up.  we did not break locks. no fbi (was) involved,  she added.  this is diplomatic security along with the foreign missions office. what they do is they just walk through, look around. the purpose of that is to make sure that people are no longer living there. and they conducted and they completed it.  in san francisco, a department of state diplomatic security guard answered the door at the russian consulate, a six storey brick building surrounded by a modest security fence and manicured hedges in the city s pacific heights neighborhood. the guard declined to comment and left the building in a black suv. a sign on the front door said the consulate was closed and gave a new mailing address. the state department guard left the consulate front door open, behind a closed gate, and sounds of activity could be heard inside, but no one responded to repeated calls by a reporter. russian president vladimir putin last month accused washington of  boorish  treatment of russia s diplomatic premises on u.s. soil, ordering the foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of russia s property rights. the dispute began late last year when former u.s. president barack obama expelled 35 russian diplomats on accusations of russian meddling in the election that took donald trump to the white house. trump took office in january, saying he wanted to improve ties with russia, while putin also spoke favorably of trump. but the allegations of interference in the vote, which moscow has denied, have persisted as an investigation by u.s. authorities has widened.  in july, moscow ordered the united states to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in russia by around 60 percent, to 455.

" russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on sunday he believed his u.s. colleagues were ready to continue dialogue with moscow on complex issues despite bilateral tensions. lavrov, who met u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on the sidelines of an international gathering in manila, said the first thing that tillerson asked about was russia’s retaliation to new u.s. sanctions against moscow. “he was primarily interested ... in details of those decisions that we grudgingly made in response to the law on anti russian sanctions,” lavrov said. the meeting was their first since president donald trump reluctantly signed into law the sanctions that russia said amounted to a full scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. “we provided an explanation,” lavrov said, referring to russia’s decision to take over a summer house compound in moscow leased by the u.s. embassy and an order to slash u.s. diplomatic presence in russia. lavrov said he also cited president vladimir putin who, in an interview to russian tv last week, explained moscow’s need to retaliate to the u.s. sanctions over its role in the ukrainian crisis and recently expanded to punish russia for meddling in the u.s. presidential election. lavrov described his talks with tillerson as lengthy and said they covered a wide range of topics, from the nuclear issue on the korean peninsula to coordination plans between russia and the united states to withstand attacks. “we felt the readiness of our u.s. colleagues to continue dialogue. i think there’s no alternative to that,” lavrov said. the two sides agreed that russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov and under secretary thomas a. shannon would continue discussing complex issues on the bilateral agenda. speaking on rossiya24 state tv, lavrov also said tillerson told him the united states’ special representative on ukraine, kurt volker, a former u.s. envoy to nato, would meet a senior aide to putin, vladimir surkov, “in the nearest future”.  “we would be interested to see what impression the u.s. special envoy has on the current state of affairs,” lavrov said. washington sent volker to ukraine last month to assess the situation in the ex soviet republic, where a 2015 ceasefire between kiev’s forces and russian backed separatists in the eastern part of the country is regularly violated. washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to improved relations between russia and the united states.

" the u.s. department of justice on friday called for the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging president donald trump violated the constitution by accepting foreign payments at his hotels. the lawsuit, filed in january, said trump violates the constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day to day control to his sons. in a filing in manhattan federal court on friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case   an ethics non profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker   do not have legal standing to sue.  the government also said payments to trump’s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president. “plaintiffs’ broad brush claims effectively assert that the constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses,” the department said in its court filing. a spokesman for ethics watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, one of the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the lawsuit said businesses such as hotel bookers are injured when foreign governments try to “curry favor” with trump by favoring his own enterprises. it said this had even occurred since trump took office, when china granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the “one china” policy of his white house predecessors. the doj on friday said any payments to trump’s restaurants in new york, a city with 24,000 restaurants, have not caused enough specific harm to plaintiffs to give them the ability to sue.   u.s. district judge ronnie abrams, an appointee of former democratic president barack obama, oversees the litigation.

" president elect donald trump plans to nominate former labor secretary elaine chao to head the transportation department, a source with knowledge of the decision said on tuesday. the source, who requested anonymity, confirmed the pick to reuters. chao, the wife of republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, served as labor secretary under president george w. bush and was the first asian american woman to hold a cabinet position. the formal announcement was expected tuesday afternoon. although trump spoke on the campaign trail about wanting to “drain the swamp” in washington, more than half of trump’s nine key appointments so far have been accomplished washington insiders, such as chao. chao will face a number of big decisions at the agency that regulates the nation’s vehicles, airplanes, railroads, pipelines, ports and highways   including how to proceed on self driving cars on u.s. roads, the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, over people and whether u.s. fuel efficiency standards should be revised. there are dozens of other pending regulatory issues the next administration will face, including railroad safety and staffing rules, requiring event data recorders in all u.s. vehicles and whether to set rules for airlines requiring they give more passengers with disabilities seats with extra leg room and whether to ban or restrict phone calls made on personal phones on u.s. flights. she may also take a leading role in trump’s plans to rebuild u.s. infrastructure. trump has called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years to rebuild airports, bridges and other projects, but it is unclear how much of the funding would come from the federal budget. mitch bainwol, chief executive of the alliance of automobile manufacturers, a trade group that has urged the trump administration to conduct a sweeping review of auto regulations, praised chao as a “superb choice.” he said the next administration will make important decisions on self driving cars and how to maximize “the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy.” former u.s. house speaker newt gingrich praised chao’s expected nomination. she will be a “great secretary of transportation. she really understands the federal government can lead rebuilding our infrastructure,” he wrote on twitter. house democratic leader nancy pelosi said democrats want to work with chao on fixing infrastructure but “will not allow republicans to use an infrastructure bill as a trojan horse for undermining workers’ wages and handing massive tax breaks to big corporations.”  chao is a former deputy transportation secretary and sits on the boards of wells fargo & co (wfc.n), ingersoll rand co [ircom.ul], news corp (nwsa.o) and vulcan materials co (vmc.n). a chinese immigrant, chao arrived in the united states at age 8. her father, james s.c. chao, is founder of the foremost group, an international shipping company.

" former u.s. vice presidential nominee sarah palin on tuesday said her husband is still in the intensive care unit of an alaska hospital with multiple injuries, including broken bones and a collapsed lung, two days after a serious snowmobile accident. todd palin, 51, suffered multiple broken ribs, a broken shoulder blade and clavicle, as well as knee and leg injuries. he was back in surgery to repair several fractures, sarah palin said in a statement on social media on tuesday. “knowing todd, once he’s cognizant, he’ll probably ask docs to duct tape him up and he’ll call it good,” she said. “he’s tough.” an attorney for sarah palin declined to comment. a representative for the hospital where todd palin is said to be receiving treatment could not be reached. the accident on sunday forced sarah palin to cut short a campaign trip for donald trump, the front runner in the race for the republican party’s presidential nomination. palin, who has endorsed trump, had been scheduled to campaign for him on monday in the villages, a central florida retirement community of more than 100,000 residents which has its own newspaper and radio station.  florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on tuesday for the nov. 8 general election. trump campaign officials said palin, 52, was returning to alaska to be with her husband and they looked forward to her return to the campaign trail soon. sarah palin was republican senator john mccain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election won by democrat barack obama.

" republican and democratic lawmakers on tuesday introduced legislation that would require border agents to obtain a warrant before searching data held on electronic devices belonging to americans. the bill comes amid rising concern among civil liberties advocates about the effect on privacy of border searches of social media information, photos and email held on phones and laptops, which have grown in frequency in recent years and do not require a warrant.  president donald trump’s administration has fanned those concerns as it has sought to implement “extreme vetting” security checks to restrict the flow of immigrants and refugees into the united states, an effort that has included consideration of a requirement that visitors share their social media passwords.  in addition to foreign visitors, media reports in recent months have suggested digital data of americans re entering the country has also been subject to added scrutiny. numbers maintained by the department of homeland security show border searches of phones have spiked in recent years, and official documents show the agency is able to extract data from some mobile devices, including those protected by passwords. generally, u.s. law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant before it can search electronic devices of an american. a unanimous 2014 u.s. supreme court decision affirmed that a search and seizure of an arrested person’s cell phone was unconstitutional without a warrant. but a so called “border search exception” allowed federal authorities to conduct searches within 100 miles (160 km) of a u.s. border without a warrant. the protecting data at the border act would seek to limit the exception by requiring a warrant before searching devices at the border that belong to a u.s. citizen of permanent resident, except in some emergency circumstances. it would not apply to foreigners with valid u.s. visas who are entering the country or people who are applying for u.s. visas. the bill would also bar officials from delaying or denying entry into the united states if a person refused to share passwords, personal information numbers, social media or online account information or access credentials. democratic senator ron wyden and republican senator rand paul sponsored the legislation, while democratic representative jared polis and republican representative blake farenthold introduced the bill in the house. despite attracting bipartisan sponsors, it was not clear whether the measure would be able to earn enough republican support to advance in the republican controlled congress. “a border stop shouldn’t be an excuse for extreme surveillance such as downloading the entire contents of your phone,” said greg nojeim, senior counsel at the center for democracy & technology, a washington civil liberties organization that supports the legislation.

" u.s. president donald trump asked lawmakers on tuesday to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, taking aim at healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor in an austere budget that also boosts the military. republicans who control the u.s. congress   and the federal purse strings   will decide whether to make politically sensitive cuts, and the proposal is unlikely to be approved in its current form. although it is not expected to survive on capitol hill, the proposal puts numbers on trump’s vision of a government that radically cuts assistance to lower income americans. the biggest savings would come from cuts to the medicaid healthcare program for the poor, which are embedded in a republican healthcare bill passed by the house of representatives. trump wants lawmakers to cut at least $610 billion from medicaid and more than $192 billion from food stamps over a decade. he seeks to balance the budget within 10 years.  the committee for a responsible federal budget, a nonpartisan policy organization, said the plan relied on gimmicks, unrealistic cuts and “rosy assumptions” of economic growth that would reach 3 percent annually by the end of trump’s first term.  the congressional budget office projects the economy to grow at an annual pace of 1.9 percent over that period.  the white house said its proposed tax cuts would help fuel higher growth and pay for themselves by generating an additional $2 trillion in revenue over 10 years. lawrence summers, a former economic adviser to democratic president barack obama, said the trump administration was double counting that money by saying it would help close budget deficits while also offsetting the revenue lost by cutting tax rates.  “it appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly 40 years i have been tracking them,” summers wrote in the washington post. mick mulvaney, trump’s budget office director, said his office made other assumptions that were probably too conservative. “we stand by the numbers,” he said. federal aid to states would shrink by 3 percent, though the cuts would fall most heavily on states that backed trump's democratic rival hillary clinton in the 2016 election. states that voted for clinton would collectively face a drop of 4.8 percent, while those that backed trump would see assistance cut by 1.2 percent. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2qhwnlv) there is some new spending in trump’s plan for fiscal year 2018, which starts in october.       the pentagon would get a spending hike, and there would be a $1.6 billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with mexico, which was a central promise of trump’s presidential campaign.     trump’s proposal foresees selling half of the u.s. emergency oil stockpile, created in 1975 after the arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes. the announcement surprised oil markets and briefly pulled down u.s. crude prices.    republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts, the cornerstone of the trump administration’s economic agenda.     but the effort has stalled as the white house grapples with the political fallout from allegations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. mulvaney said the plan is the first one in a long time to pay attention to taxpayers. “you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it,” he told reporters. republican leaders in the house said lawmakers would be able to find common ground with the budget plan. senator bernie sanders, who ran a populist campaign during the democratic presidential primary, said the budget showed that trump’s campaign promises to stand up for working people was “just cheap and dishonest campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes,” sanders told a news conference. while the plan boosts defense spending by $54 billion, it falls short of campaign promises for a “historic” hike in military spending amid plans to rebuild the u.s. navy. that is only 3 percent more than former president barack obama had sought in his long term budget plan. the president would reduce nearly a third of funding for diplomacy and foreign aid including global health and food aid, peacekeeping and other forms of non military foreign involvement. “if we implemented this budget, you’d have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk,” said republican senator lindsey graham. “this budget is not going to go anywhere.” trump upheld his promise   for the most part   that he would not cut medicare and social security, two expensive safety net programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms. those programs may not come out of capitol hill unscathed, however. house majority leader kevin mccarthy, a fellow republican, said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them. the white house proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, better known as food stamps, to work. most government departments would see steep cuts, particularly the state department and the environmental protection agency.   treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the budget plan will boost economic growth by fostering capital investment and creating jobs for workers who gave up their job hunts during tough times.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe is considering increasing energy imports from the united states, two sources familiar with the plan told reuters, as he prepares to meet president donald trump, who has complained about japan’s trade surplus. japan is putting together a package of plans for japanese companies to invest in infrastructure and job creation projects in the united states for abe to take to the feb. 10 meeting with trump in washington.  another idea is to offer to increase liquid natural gas (lng) imports from the united states, a source in the ruling coalition told reuters. another option, if abe determines that trump is most concerned about the trade gap, is to increase imports of u.s. shale oil or gas on top of the investment package, according to a top executive at a major japanese corporation who is close to abe. japanese officials have been scrambling to respond to trump’s scattershot comments since he took office.  he has threatened to impose a tax on car imports from mexico, criticized japan’s trade gap with the united states and most recently accused japan, along with china and germany, of devaluing their currencies to the detriment of u.s. companies. “(abe) wants to know what’s the most important thing for trump,” said the executive, who declined to be identified. “if it is the trade surplus that trump cares the most about, for instance, then we could come up with a few possible solutions,” including importing more u.s. shale oil or gas.  abe’s approach toward trump would be “not accommodating, not opposing”, he said. utilities would be resistant to buying more u.s. shale gas because they have already committed to buying large amounts and japan’s demand for energy is falling, an executive at a japanese gas importer told reuters on condition of anonymity.  prices for lng in asia lng as have fallen by almost a fifth this year amid a supply glut. japan is the world’s biggest buyer of the gas cooled to liquid form for transport on ships and takes in nearly a third of global shipments. once seen as a panacea for japan’s energy crisis after the fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 led to the shutdown of most reactors in the country, u.s. shale gas is now just one of many options for japan to meet its needs. japan took in its first shipment of shale gas in liquid form this month and more shipments are likely to come as more export terminals start shipments this year and next. the yomiuri newspaper said on thursday abe’s growth and jobs initiative would include a plan for japan and the united states to jointly develop a $450 billion “infrastructure market”, into which the japanese government and companies would invest $150 billion over 10 years.

" venezuela s supreme court has progressively dismantled the rule of law, becoming an instrument of president nicolas maduro s government in what amounts to a coup against the constitutional order, an international human rights group said on tuesday. the collapse of the judiciary has left victims of torture, killings and disappearances and their families without recourse to justice after months of violent street protests, the international commission of jurists (icj) said. it called on the u.n. human rights council to take action.  we have seen a judiciary that has essentially lost its independence and become a tool of a very authoritarian executive branch,  sam zarifi, icj secretary general, told a news briefing.  this breakdown of the rule of law has also severely obstructed accountability (and) essentially made it impossible to bring to justice those responsible for gross violations of human rights,  he said. the venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. foreign minister jorge arreaza on monday rejected as  baseless  a u.n. report that found excessive use of force by its security forces and other violations. four months of demonstrations in which at least 125 people were killed have all but stopped due to fatigue among protesters and disillusionment at seeing the ruling socialist party cement vast powers despite the concerted opposition push. the icj said the top court had undermined human rights and infringed the constitution through a series of rulings since december 2015. in two rulings in march 2017, the supreme court of justice  effectively claimed legislative powers for itself, depriving the national assembly of its constitutional powers and granting sweeping arbitrary powers to the executive,  it said.  these decisions amount to a coup d tat against the constitutional order and have ushered in a new reign of arbitrary rule,  zarifi said. judges on the supreme court are mainly from the socialist party or former officials of the government of maduro or both, the geneva based jurists  group said.  judges who have demonstrated independence and ruled against the executive branch have faced retaliation and punishment,  zarifi said. maduro denies accusations of a power grab, saying his actions, which include the creation of an alternative constituent assembly that has granted itself law making powers, aim to restore peace after months of protests and violence. the new constituent assembly  at this point acts as a body outside of the rule of law. it is able to legislate and create law and new regulations in the country without accountability,  zarifi said. the icj report,  the supreme court of justice: an instrument of executive power , was issued on the sidelines of the u.n. human rights council. u.n. human rights chief zeid ra ad al hussein said on monday that venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation.  the evidence that s there, of course it is not adjudicated, but certainly suggests room for investigating crimes against humanity,  zarifi said. such crimes are defined as grave and systematic violations including torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings that are part of a state s policy, he said, adding:  those indicators are all there in venezuela.  carlos ayala, a venezuelan lawyer and icj commissioner based in caracas, told the briefing:  the situation is worsening on a daily basis because of hyper inflation (and) the lack of access for the majority of the population to medicines and health care.  more than 600 civilian students are currently being tried before military courts in venezuela, more than 1,000 young persons, students, are in jail because of the demonstrations.

" taiwan s president tsai ing wen has accepted the resignation of premier lin chuan, the ruling party said on monday, a departure that had been widely expected because of the president s falling public support. taiwan presidents often shuffle premiers in response to dips in popularity. lin had faced mounting pressure to step down as tsai s popularity plummeted to 29.8 percent by august, a private foundation survey has shown. when she took office in may 2016, her approval rating was as high as 70 percent.  the president has accepted his resignation after sincere talks,  tsai s democratic progressive party (dpp) said in a statement.  under taiwan s system, the president is the more important office, holding the jobs of commander in chief and head of state. the prime minister is appointed by the president to lead the cabinet. tsai is likely to be looking ahead to her 2020 re election campaign. frozen relations with china, a backlash over pension reforms and a revised labor rule, among other controversies, have put pressure on her to replace lin, in preparation for that campaign. lin said the party had  reached a point where we must embark on the next stage of the mission .  so i ve resigned to pave the way for the president to re organize her team and resources for that purpose,  he said. the presidential office said a new premier would be announced on tuesday. william lai, the popular mayor of the southern city of tainan and a leading dpp figure, is widely expected to replace lin.  a lai premiership would not necessary help the president to improve her ratings, some analysts said.  they need a reboot, because current ratings for both are low,  said alex huang, a professor of tamkang university, taipei, referring to tsai and lin, adding that it must have been a hard decision for tsai because of their friendship.  lin is sort of biting the bullet to clear the path ahead for the president and the next premier,  huang said. some representatives of the opposition kuomintang (kmt) have expressed scepticism that tsai would build an effective partnership with lai, if he did replace lin.  i d like to see how they both work together,  said lai shyh bao, a kmt legislator.  both tsai and lai have reputations for being overbearing and domineering.  lin has been criticized not just by legislators from the opposition, but also from his own dpp. tsai had praised him as  a great communicator  when she introduced him last year. lin, a close confidant of the president who retains her trust, could become the next central bank governor when current governor perng fai nan retires next year.

" u.s. president donald trump spoke by phone on friday with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi to discuss qatar and the need for gulf unity, a senior administration official said. it was the fourth call trump has had with a regional leader since gulf allies severed diplomatic ties with qatar on monday over long standing allegations that doha is courting iran. during his phone calls, trump has emphasized a desire for gulf unity in the wake of the crisis but has made clear he sees a need for qatar to improve its behavior, said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. trump got to know many gulf leaders during his trip to saudi arabia last month during which he attended a summit of gulf cooperation council nations. the united arab emirates, saudi arabia, egypt and bahrain broke off ties with qatar over its ties to iran, which they deem the region’s biggest external threat, and supporting islamist groups, seen as the biggest internal danger. trump antagonized iran this week in a statement offering prayers for the victims of attacks claimed by islamic state militants that killed at least 12 people in tehran. he said that “states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.” ",0
" the united states will expand its program helping the thousands of people fleeing violence in el salvador, guatemala and honduras, u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on wednesday. the announcement follows backlash from democrats in the u.s. congress who called on the obama administration to halt its deportations of families who fled the three crime infested central american countries and entered the united states without documentation. the expanded refugee admissions program would offer “a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,” kerry said in a speech at the national defense university. president barack obama previously said the united states would take in 3,000 refugees from latin america by october this year. a state department spokesperson said the administration does not have plans to take in more than 3,000 refugees from the region, but it may adjust the number “should conditions require.” he said the u.s. government would work with the united nations and non governmental organizations to identify people  in need of refugee protection. he specifically mentioned those targeted by criminal gangs, including human rights activists. “we also continue to explore additional options, including for those who may be at imminent risk of harm,” kerry said. once the united nations high commissioner on human rights refers a potential refugee to the united states for resettlement, the case is reviewed at a resettlement support center, according to the state department.    the united states operates nine centers globally, but only one is in the western hemisphere   in quito, ecuador. the state department spokesperson said the quito center operates a branch office in san salvador, el salvador.  kerry did not say whether the united states would deploy any federal workers to the region or had plans to open additional centers.  the department of homeland security has received more than 6,000 applications from minors in central america, some of whom have begun to arrive in the united states as refugees, secretary of homeland security jeh johnson said on jan. 4. he said he expected the pace of child refugee arrivals to increase.

" facebook said on wednesday its efforts to fight fake news during germany s national elections included taking down tens of thousands of fake profiles in the final month of the campaign. richard allan, facebook s vice president of public policy for europe, middle east africa, said the silicon valley based company mounted an array of efforts to ensure the social media network was not used as a platform to manipulate public opinion.  these actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election   but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people s news feeds,  the facebook executive said in a statement. news feed is the central feature in user profiles whereby they can see updates from people they follow. chancellor angela merkel s christian democratic union secured victory in sunday s balloting with fewer votes than expected, forcing her to enter complicated coalition talks with various parties to form a new government. the company said it made a stronger push to remove fake accounts when it observed suspicious activity following widely reported foreign interference in the french and u.s. presidential elections over the past year. besides seeking to encourage civic participation and voter education efforts, it also worked closely with authorities, including the federal office for information security (bsi), to monitor security threats during the campaign.   studies concluded that the level of false news was low,  concluded allan, a former british member of parliament who, in addition to his work for facebook, has been a member of the house of lords since 2010. a variety of german political experts and social media watchers had given the campaign largely a clean bill of health in terms of any wide scale efforts to swing votes in the run up to voting day.

" democratic new york city mayor bill de blasio scored a decisive victory on tuesday in his bid to secure a second four year term in charge of the united states’ biggest city. with more than 75 percent of the city’s voting precincts reporting, de blasio, 56, had won nearly 65 percent, a margin of 35 percentage points over his republican opponent, state assemblywoman nicole malliotakis, according to new york city’s board of elections. the new york times and other media called the race for de blasio. de blasio, who held a comfortable lead in opinion polls leading up to election day, had been widely expected to cruise to victory in a city of 8.5 million people dominated by democratic voters.  a progressive liberal, de blasio in the past week campaigned with u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont, an independent. sanders backed de blasio’s call for a tax hike on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in albany. the mayor has positioned himself as one of the most vocal critics of republican president donald trump, who has received strong disapproval ratings from voters in his native city. daisy taberas, 71, who immigrated from peru 48 years ago, said she voted for de blasio because of her concerns over trump’s stance on immigration. “i like the way (de blasio) works with children in the schools, and he’s trying to protect the city and he cares about immigration,” taberas said after casting her ballot at a manhattan polling site.  de blasio has taken heat for problems in the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the united states. the mayor, who has faced complaints over rising disruptions and delays on the subway system, has emphasized that it is run by a state controlled authority, not the city. he has also been plagued by accusations of a pay to play culture within city hall. a former donor, jona rechnitz, recently testified at the corruption trial of a union boss that he established a direct line to the de blasio administration after raising money for the mayor’s election campaign in 2013. after years of investigation, federal prosecutors said in march they would not charge de blasio, a point he reiterated on the campaign trail. the mayor campaigned on his efforts to increase affordable housing, establish universal pre kindergarten for 4 year olds and maintain the city’s historically low crime rates.

" the u.s. senate on wednesday took up a measure to repeal regulations adopted by the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc. the senate began debate on wednesday evening under a provision that allows congress to repeal recently approved federal regulations. under the rules approved by the federal communications commission in october under then president barack obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. earlier this month, the fcc temporarily blocked those rules from taking effect, a victory for internet providers such as at&t inc comcast corp and verizon communications inc that had strongly opposed the measure. a final senate vote on the measure is expected on thursday, but it was not clear when the u.s. house of representatives might take up the measure. “congress needs to repeal these privacy restrictions in order to restore balance to the internet ecosystem and provide certainty to consumers,” said senator jeff flake, a republican who sponsored the measure. but democratic senator bill nelson said that broadband providers build profiles “about our children from birth. this is a gold mine of data – the holy grail so to speak. it is no wonder that broadband providers want to be able to sell this information to the highest bidder without consumers’ knowledge or consent. and they want to collect and use this information without providing transparency or being held accountable.”  the american civil liberties union also criticized the proposal to undo the rules. “with this move, congress is essentially allowing companies like comcast, at&t, and verizon to sell consumers’ private information to the highest bidder,” aclu general counsel neema singh guliani said earlier this month. fcc chairman ajit pai, nominated by republican president donald trump to serve a second five year term on the commission, said earlier this month that consumers would have privacy protections even without the obama administration internet provider rules.     republican commissioners, including pai, said in october that the rules would unfairly give websites like facebook, twitter inc or google the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers and thus dominate digital advertising. websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the federal trade commission.  democratic senator edward markey said “just as phone companies cannot sell information about americans’ phone calls, an internet service provider should not be allowed to sell sensitive consumer information without affirmative consent.” ",0

" a bipartisan senate proposal to shore up obamacare insurance marketplaces would cut the u.s. deficit by $3.8 billion over the next decade and would not substantially change the number of americans with health insurance, a nonpartisan arm of congress said on wednesday. legislation introduced last week by republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray would restore for two years subsidies to private insurers to help lower income people buy insurance. president donald trump this month cut off those subsidies. the bill also would provide states more flexibility to change some rules in the 2010 affordable care act, the signature legislative achievement of the republican trump’s democratic predecessor, barack obama. the nonpartisan congressional budget office previously estimated that various republican proposals to repeal and replace obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose health insurance. in contrast, the cbo on wednesday said reinstating the subsidies, as called for in the alexander murray bill, would not substantially alter the number of insured. the cbo also estimated that the fix would not impact 2018 health insurance rates because they are already set. health insurers said they raised premiums on average 20 percent to make up for the lost federal subsidies. the cbo said it expected 2019 health insurance premiums to be lower with the insurer payments than without them. while the alexander murray legislation would reduce the federal deficit, the cbo previously found that eliminating the subsidies, called cost sharing reductions, would raise the federal deficit by $194 billion over a decade. because premiums would rise in the absence of the subsidies, the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low income americans. about 20 million americans obtained insurance through obamacare and the law helped drive the u.s. uninsured rate to a record low, but republicans have called it an unwarranted government intrusion in a healthcare system that represents a fifth of the u.s. economy. it is unclear whether the alexander murray bill will ever come to a vote in congress. trump has sent mixed signals about it, initially supporting it last week and then opposing it. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would not bring it up without trump’s support. trump has derided the insurer payments as a “bailout” and has vowed to let obamacare “implode.”  “it does not bail out insurance companies, it does benefit consumers, it does benefit taxpayers to the tune of $3.8 billion,” alexander said on wednesday on the senate floor. insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people.     trump, who as a candidate promised to get rid of obamacare, has been frustrated by the inability of a congress led by his own party to pass a bill to repeal and replace it, and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law. house of representatives speaker paul ryan has signaled his opposition and on wednesday said his chamber would not take up the matter or try again to pass broader republican legislation to repeal and replace obamacare this year. with broad democratic backing and the support of a dozen republican senators, the alexander murray bill has sufficient backing to exceed the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100 seat senate, if mcconnell allows it to come to a vote. two prominent republicans in the house and senate on tuesday announced a competing obamacare fix that is more conservative and appears to address many of the trump administration’s objections to the alexander murray proposal.  the proposal by republican senator orrin hatch, chairman of the senate finance committee, and republican representative kevin brady, chairman of the house ways and means committee, includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to buy health coverage under obamacare. ryan told reuters in an interview he favored the hatch brady proposal.

" the leader of germany s social democrats (spd) pledged to have u.s. nuclear weapons withdrawn from german territory if, against the odds, he defeats angela merkel to become chancellor next month. addressing a campaign rally in trier late on tuesday, spd leader martin schulz also said he, unlike merkel, would resist demands by u.s. president donald trump for nato members to increase their defense spending.  trump wants nuclear armament. we are against this,  schulz said, apparently trying to differentiate his party from merkel s more hawkish christian democratic union (cdu).  as chancellor, i will commit germany to having the nuclear weapons stationed here withdrawn from our country,  he said. about 20 u.s. nuclear warheads are thought to be stationed at a military base in buechel, in western germany, according to unofficial estimates. the u.s. embassy in berlin said it does not comment on nuclear weapons in germany. taking advantage of trump s extreme unpopularity in germany, schulz also said he would use the money merkel had earmarked for increased military spending for other purposes.  what to do with our money is the central question of this election,  he said, referring to a 30 billion euro tax surplus.  trump demands that 2 percent of gdp, 30 billion euros, should go to military spending, and merkel agreed to that without asking german citizens.  germany and other nato members had already pledged to raise their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product before trump was elected. while most of them have increased spending on their militaries, only a few have reached the 2 percent goal, and germany is not one of them. most recent polls show schulz s party polling at around 24 percent, some 14 percentage points behind merkel. most expect a booming economy and low unemployment will carry her into a fourth term in sept. 24 elections. however, with germans historically wary of using military force since world war two, schulz s message may resonate among the spd s core voters. after 12 years in office, merkel has become increasingly confident on the global stage. she has pushed for germany to become more militarily self reliant, partly in response to trump s hinting that he might abandon nato allies if they do not spend more on defense. earlier this year, merkel said the times when germany could rely on others to defend it were  to some extent in the past  .

" nato is set to agree on thursday to increase its afghanistan training mission by some 3,000 troops, alliance officials said, after the united states switched tack in long running efforts to defeat taliban militants and end the conflict. fresh nato personnel will not have a combat role but the alliance hopes more soldiers can train the afghan army and air force to complement u.s. president donald trump s strategy to send more american counter terrorism troops to the country.  we have decided to increase the number of troops ... to help the afghans break the stalemate, to send a message to the taliban, to the insurgents that they will not win on the battleground,  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg told a news conference on tuesday. nato defense ministers are expected to approve the deployment in the latter part of a two day meeting that starts on wednesday. the troops would be deployed from the start of 2018, a nato official said. the west says it is determined to stabilize a country facing resurgent rebels 16 years after the united states sought to topple the taliban rulers who had harbored the al qaeda militants behind attacks on new york and washington. stoltenberg said an attack on tuesday on a television station in kabul underlined the importance of fighting militants and supporting afghan security forces. islamic state claimed responsibility for the assault, without giving evidence. trump s envoy to nato, ambassador kay bailey hutchinson, said the u.s. goal was to show taliban militants they could not win in military combat.  trump s strategy in afghanistan, unveiled in august, rests on providing more troops, a stronger afghan army, support from regional allies such as india and a harder line with pakistan. u.s. officials say pakistan provides refuge and support to the taliban and other extremist groups, which pakistan denies.  we d like to see pakistan come in, in a positive effort to help stabilize afghanistan,  hutchinson said. there have been several attempts in recent years to broker a settlement between the western backed government in kabul and the taliban, but all have failed. without the militants at the table, experts say it is hard to envisage a peace settlement. nato allies have already promised almost $3 billion to help the united states fund the afghan military until 2020, which is developing an air force to complement its ground forces.  troop contributions had rested on nato allies seeing more details about trump s strategy, diplomats said. the nato contribution would boost the training mission, called resolute support, to around 16,000 troops, stoltenberg said. about half the additional troops would come from the united states and the rest from nato allies and partner countries. u.s. army general john nicholson, the commander of the resolute support mission and of u.s. forces in afghanistan, said in february that a few thousand more troops would make a difference. about 11,000 u.s. troops are serving in afghanistan, the pentagon said in august, including almost 7,000 in resolute support, according to nato data. under trump s new strategy, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said in september that more than 3,000 additional u.s. troops would be deployed to afghanistan. taken together, the new deployments could take the total number of western troops in the country to above 20,000, according to current and projected troop numbers   well below a 2011 peak of more than 100,000.

" sri lankan police arrested 19 people after a clash between  extremists  from the majority buddhist and minority muslim communities in which four people were injured, a spokesman said on saturday. tension has been growing between the two communities this year, with some hardline buddhist groups accusing muslims of forcing people to convert to islam and vandalizing buddhist archaeological sites. some buddhists nationalists have also protested against the presence in sri lanka of asylum seekers from mostly buddhist myanmar s persecuted rohingya muslim minority. police said the late friday violence in the southern coastal town of ginthota was triggered by rumors and fake messages on social media.  this was a clash between a small fraction of extremists in the both ethnic groups,  police spokesman ruwan gunasekera told reuters.  one of those arrested was a woman who falsely spread news that muslims were about to attack a buddhist temple, he said.  we ve decided to arrest those who have been spreading false messages and rumors on social media.  later police said all 19 suspects have been remanded until nov. 30 and a local curfew had been imposed in the clash area for 12 hours to 0600 hours (0300 gmt) on sunday.  law and order minister sagala ratnayaka said  some political groups are now on a desperate mission to turn this minor brawl into a sinhala muslim clash .   i urge the public not to be misled by their false propaganda,  he said. additional police battalions, elite police forces, the anti riot squad and the military were called late on friday to bring the situation under control.  buddhists make up about 70 percent of sri lanka s population of 21 million, compared with about 9 percent for muslims. president maithripala sirisena s government, after coming under fire from rights groups and diplomats for not doing enough to crack down on hardline buddhist groups, acted against anti muslim attackers in june this year.  that response came after more than 20 attacks on muslims, including arson at muslim owned businesses and petrol bomb attacks on mosques, were recorded in two months. in 2014, three muslims were killed in riots stirred up by hardline buddhist groups.

" president donald trump’s doubts about the war in afghanistan has led to a delay in completing a new u.s. strategy in south asia, skepticism that included a suggestion that the u.s. military commander in the region be fired, u.s. officials said on wednesday.  during a july 19 meeting in the white house situation room, trump demanded that his top national security aides provide more information on what one official called “the end state” in a country where the united states has spent 16 years fighting against the taliban with no end in sight.  the meeting grew stormy when trump said defense secretary james mattis and joint chiefs of staff chairman joseph dunford, a marine general, should consider firing army general john nicholson, commander of u.s. forces in afghanistan, for not winning the war.  “we aren’t winning,” he told them, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  related coverage commentary: steve bannon is right on afghanistan commentary: the road to afghanistan peace does not lie in kabul in addition, once the meeting concluded, trump’s chief strategist, steve bannon, got into what one official called “a shouting match” with white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster over the direction of u.s. policy.  some officials left the meeting “stunned” by the president’s vehement complaints that the military was allowing the united states to lose the war.  mattis, mcmaster and other top aides are putting together answers to trump’s questions in a way to try to get him to approve the strategy, the officials said.  the white house had no comment on the accounts of the meeting.  another meeting of top aides is scheduled on thursday.  although trump earlier this year gave mattis the authority to deploy u.s. military forces as he sees fit, in fact the defense secretary’s plans to add around 4,000 more u.s. troops to the 8,400 currently deployed in afghanistan are being caught up in the delay surrounding the strategy, the officials said.  “it’s been contingent all along informally on the strategy being approved,” a senior administration official said of the troop deployment.  trump has long been a skeptic of lingering u.s. involvement in foreign wars and has expressed little interest in deploying military forces without a specific plan on what they will do and for how long.  officials said trump argued that the united states should demand a share of afghanistan’s estimated $1 trillion in mineral wealth in exchange for its assistance to the afghan government.  but other officials noted that without securing the entire country, which could take many years, there is no way to get the country’s mineral riches to market, except to iran. trump complained that the chinese are profiting from their mining operations, the officials said.

" president donald trump met monday at the white house with leaders of construction, carpenters, plumbers and sheet metal unions, the white house said. according to the white house, participants included north america’s building trades unions president sean mcgarvey, laborers’ international union of north america president terry o’sullivan, smart sheet metal workers’ union president joseph sellers, united brotherhood of carpenters president doug mccarron and mark mcmanus, president of the united association that represents plumbers, pipefitters, welders and others. the union meeting also included several local union officials and follows a gathering of 12 chief executives of large companies at the white house to discuss revitalizing the u.s. manufacturing economy. earlier this month, trump held separate meetings with teamsters president jim hoffa and afl cio president richard trumka in new york. on monday, trump signed an order to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership trade agreement, a deal that was harshly criticized by organized labor. “this is a group i know well,” trump said at the meeting with union members, noting as a businessman he hired thousands of union workers for construction projects. not all major unions were invited to monday’s event. a spokesman for the united steelworkers union, wayne ranick, said the union was not invited. “we are always interested in such discussions given that 100,000s of our members work in manufacturing and (are) affected by trade,” he said in an email. trump sparred with a local steelworkers union president chuck jones in december over the number of jobs united technologies corp agreed to save at a carrier plant in indiana. nearly all major unions endorsed trump’s rival, hillary clinton, during the presidential election campaign. during the campaign, trump appealed to blue collar workers in midwestern states vowing to bring jobs back from mexico, which helped him win crucial states like ohio, michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania. a cnn exit poll said trump carried 42 percent of voters in union households compared with 51 percent for clinton. he did far better among union members than republican presidential nominee mitt romney did in 2012.

" myanmar s army unearthed the bodies of 17 hindu villagers on monday, taking to 45 the number authorities suspect were killed by muslim insurgents last month at the onset of a wave of violence that has sent 436,000 refugees fleeing to bangladesh. the bodies have been found since sunday buried outside a village in rakhine state in western myanmar, where bloodshed erupted on aug. 25 when rohingya muslim insurgents launched coordinated attacks on about 30 police posts and an army camp. the united nations has described a sweeping military response to those attacks as  ethnic cleansing  aimed at driving rohingya out of buddhist majority myanmar. myanmar rejects that, saying it is fighting terrorists.   there is no ethnic cleansing. there is no genocide,  myanmar s u.n. ambassador hau do suan told the u.n. general assembly in new york on monday.  the leaders of myanmar who have long been striving for freedom and human rights would not espouse such policies.   we will do everything to prevent ethnic cleansing and genocide,  the diplomat said.  it is the responsibility of every government to fight against terrorism and protect innocent civilians. we condemn all human rights violations and violent acts.  myanmar said before the mass graves were found that more than 400 people had been killed, most of them insurgents. members of myanmar s small hindu minority appear to have been caught in the middle. some have fled to bangladesh, complaining of violence against them by soldiers or buddhist vigilantes. others have complained of being attacked by the insurgents on suspicion of being government spies. a search was launched on the weekend after a refugee in bangladesh contacted a hindu community leader in myanmar to say insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) marched about 100 people out of their village on aug. 25 and killed them, the government said. twenty eight bodies were found on sunday.  this afternoon, a suspicious place was found about 400 meters northeast of the mass grave where the remains of hindus were found yesterday,  the army said in a statement.  seventeen bodies of men were retrieved.  the government has not speculated as to why the hindus were killed. the army said the security forces and hindu community leaders would continue the search. access to the area by journalists as well as human rights workers and aid workers is largely restricted. an arsa spokesman denied his group had killed the hindus, saying buddhist nationalists were trying to divide hindus and muslims.  arsa has internationally pledged not to target civilians and that remains unchanged, no matter what,  the spokesman, who is based in a neighboring country and identified himself only as abdullah, told reuters through a messaging service. the violence in rakhine state and the refugee exodus is the biggest crisis the government of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi has faced since it came to power last year in a transition from nearly 50 years of military rule.     myanmar regards the rohingya muslims as illegal immigrants from bangladesh and communal violence has flared periodically for decades. most rohingya are stateless. in bangladesh, the head of the u.n. refugee agency said the rohingya seeking shelter from  unimaginable horrors  faced enormous hardship and risked a dramatic deterioration in circumstances unless aid was stepped up.  they (have) seen villages burned down, families shot or hacked to death, women and girls brutalized,  u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi told a news conference in dhaka after visiting camps near the border on the weekend.  solutions to this crisis lie with myanmar , he said, though for now, the world had to help and aid should be  rapidly stepped up . a reuters reporter in bangladesh said refugees were still arriving, with about 50 seen on monday. the crisis has also threatened to drive a wedge into the association of south east asian nations, with muslim majority malaysia disavowing a statement on the myanmar situation from the bloc s chairman, the philippines, on the grounds it misrepresented  the reality  and did not identify the rohingya as one of the affected communities. myanmar, which is a member of the regional grouping, objects to the term rohingya, saying the muslims of rakhine state are not a distinct ethnic group. this month, malaysia summoned myanmar s ambassador to express its grave concern over  atrocities  there.

" hurricane irma poses a bigger menace to power supplies in florida than hurricane harvey did in texas because irma is packing near 200 mile per hour winds (320 km/h) that could down power lines, close nuclear plants and threats to leave millions of homes and businesses in the dark for weeks. irma s winds rival the strongest for any hurricane in history in the atlantic, whereas harvey s damage came from record rainfall. even as houston flooded, the power stayed on for most, allowing citizens to use tv and radio to stay apprised of danger, or social media to call for help.  when harvey made landfall in texas it made it fully inland and weakened pretty quickly. irma, however, could retain much of its strength,  said jason setree, a meteorologist at commodity weather group. irma has killed several people and devastated islands in the caribbean.  current forecasts put almost the entirety of the florida peninsula in the path of the storm, which made landfall in the caribbean with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h). the threat of the category 5 storm, at the top of the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale, is grave enough that electricity generator florida power & light (fpl) plans to shut its two nuclear power plants in the state, and officials warned that it may have to rebuild parts of its power system, which could take weeks.  most florida residents have not experienced a major storm since 2005, when total outages peaked around 3.6 million during hurricane wilma. some of those outages lasted for weeks. setree compared the projected path of irma to hurricane matthew in 2016, which knocked out power to about 1.2 million fpl customers in october. fpl, a unit of florida energy company nextera energy inc, restored service to most customers affected by matthew in just two days. but fpl spokesman chris mcgrath said:  with a storm as powerful as irma, we want customers to prepare for damage to our infrastructure and potentially prolonged power outages.  he said it was too soon to speculate on the number and location of customers irma could affect.  in a statement this week, fpl estimated about half of its near five million customers   particularly in the trio of populous southeast counties miami dade, palm beach and broward   had not experienced a major hurricane since 2005.  should irma s worst fears be realized, our crews will likely have to completely rebuild parts of our electric system. restoring power through repairs is measured in days; rebuilding our electric system could be measured in weeks,  fpl chief executive eric silagy said. fpl, florida s biggest power provider, said it had invested nearly $3 billion since 2006 to strengthen its grid, including placing 60 main power lines underground and installing nearly five million smart meters and other devices. other publicly traded utilities in the sunshine state, including units of duke energy corp, southern co and emera inc, said in statements that they had also invested in intelligent, self healing devices. smart meters allow utilities to see outages as they occur, rather than waiting on customer calls, and utilities also use automated devices that can reenergize lines without damage that were taken offline because of contact with trees or other objects, said jay apt, director of the carnegie mellon electricity industry center in pittsburgh. olivia ross, a spokeswoman for centerpoint energy, which serves the greater houston area, said these devices helped the utility keep the lights on for more people in the aftermath of harvey as some issues were resolved remotely. but such devices can only do so much. harvey s outages were limited to 312,000 customers, of which centerpoint was responsible for about 109,000, as it quickly lost force after landfall and turned into a tropical storm. by contrast, ross noted, hurricane ike in 2008 caused 2.1 million of centerpoint s customers to lose power when it hit the texas coast near houston.

" u.s. president barack obama called incoming philippines president rodrigo duterte on tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries’ alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the white house said. u.s. officials have signaled that washington is ready to work with duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. obama’s deputy national security adviser, ben rhodes, told a washington seminar earlier on tuesday that the u.s. administration was aware there was some “controversy” surrounding duterte and “statements that drew attention in the past,” but he did not elaborate. obama offered his congratulations to duterte as the “presumptive president elect.” he won the largest share of the votes in a may 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. obama “highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,” the white house said. washington hoped “to build on progress made with the last administration” in the philippines, rhodes said. “this is a new government and we’ll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,” he said when asked about the election, adding that washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. he has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of u.s. national security interests given china’s increasingly assertive stance in asia and maritime disputes in the south china sea. duterte’s vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. rhodes noted u.s. support for manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with china in the south china sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater u.s. military presence in the philippines.  “we believe that now as much as ever it’s important that the u.s. and philippines are seen working together,” he said. the u.s. stance on duterte could echo its approach toward india’s prime minister narendra modi. at one point, modi was unable to obtain a u.s. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the white house when he became prime minister.

" republican efforts to overhaul the u.s. tax code have hit a snag in the house of representatives, where infighting over spending cuts is delaying adoption of a legislative tool they need to move a tax bill forward. the house budget committee canceled plans to send a budget resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, lawmakers said on tuesday, as conservative republicans pushed to add hundreds of billions of dollars in mandatory spending cuts to the blueprint. house and senate passage of a budget resolution is vital to president donald trump’s pledge to deliver on tax reform this year because the document would free republicans to circumvent democratic opposition in the senate. but the push to cut programs including medicaid and food stamps, which benefit the poor, could lead to a stalemate. trump administration officials and republican leaders in congress are working separately to agree on a tax bill that can be unveiled in september. “no budget, no tax reform,” said representative mark walker, who chairs the republican study committee, a group of more than 150 conservative lawmakers. “that’s why there should be a sense of urgency to get this done pretty quick.” their aim is to cut mandatory programs that are required by law and viewed as principle drivers of deficit spending. the result could be legislation containing lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations alongside reduced benefits for the poor.  lawmakers say there is republican agreement on topline discretionary spending levels of $621.5 billion for defense and $511 billion for non defense programs. representative jim jordan, a leading member of the conservative house freedom caucus, is pushing to cut as much as $400 billion over a decade from a range of programs that benefit the poor. freedom caucus chairman mark meadows said he wanted another $295 billion in cuts on top of that.  “it has to be linked to tax reform, because we believe tax reform is going to happen,” jordan said in an interview.  the budget committee canceled its plans this week after the chairmen of several other panels pushed back against efforts to include $250 billion in spending cuts. “the end game is to get a budget out of the committee,” house budget committee chairwoman diane black told reporters. “i do see a viable path. and i am going to continue to push.”  ",0

" u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley on thursday described russian interference in u.s. elections as “warfare.” u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that russia used cyber enabled means in an attempt to help president donald trump win the white house, an allegation the kremlin has denied. “we have to be so hard on this and we have to hold them accountable,” haley said during a panel discussion with former secretaries of state madeleine albright and condoleezza rice held by the george w. bush institute in new york on thursday.  “when a country can come interfere in another country’s elections that is warfare. it really is, because you’re making sure that the democracy shifts from what the people want,” she said. “this is their new weapon of choice and we have to get in front of it.” congressional committees and special counsel robert mueller are investigating alleged russian interference in the election, including whether there was any collusion between trump associates and moscow. trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and associates and russia.

" president donald trump’s administration is exploring hardening its approach toward pakistan to crack down on pakistan based militants launching attacks in neighboring afghanistan, two u.s. officials tell reuters.  potential trump administration responses being discussed include expanding u.s. drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading pakistan’s status as a major non nato ally, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. other u.s. officials are skeptical of the prospects for success, arguing that years of previous u.s. efforts to curb pakistan’s support for militant groups have failed, and that already strengthening u.s. ties to india, pakistan’s arch enemy, undermine chances of a breakthrough with islamabad.  u.s. officials say generally they seek greater cooperation with pakistan, not a rupture in ties, once the administration finishes a regional review, due by mid july, of the strategy guiding the 16 year old war in afghanistan.  the discussions include officials from across the trump administration, including the white house and the defense department, both of which declined comment on the review before its completion. precise actions have yet to be decided. but pakistan’s embassy in washington warned against “scapegoating” pakistan to explain the stalemate in afghanistan, pointing instead to afghanistan’s own troubled internal dynamics. it also noted past pakistani efforts to battle militants and expressed willingness to work with the united states and afghanistan on border management. “singling out pakistan and pinning the entire blame on pakistan for the situation in afghanistan is neither fair nor accurate, nor is it borne out by the ground realities,” said abid saeed, press minister at the embassy. experts on america’s longest war argue that militant safe havens in pakistan have allowed taliban linked insurgents a place to plot deadly strikes in afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives.  although long mindful of pakistan, the trump administration  in recent weeks has put more emphasis on the relationship with islamabad in discussions as it hammers out a regional strategy to be presented to trump, who took office in late january, one official said. “we’ve never really fully articulated what our strategy towards pakistan is. the strategy will more clearly say what we want from pakistan specifically,” the u.s. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. other u.s. officials question whether any mix of carrots and sticks can get islamabad to change its behavior. at the end of the day, washington needs a partner, even if an imperfect one, in nuclear armed pakistan, they say. the united states is again poised to deploy thousands more troops in afghanistan, an acknowledgment that u.s. backed forces are not winning and taliban militants are resurgent. without more pressure on militants within pakistan who target afghanistan, experts say additional u.s. troop deployments will fail to meet their ultimate objective: to pressure the taliban to eventually negotiate peace. “i believe there will be a much harder u.s. line on pakistan going forward than there has been in the past,” hamdullah mohib, the afghan ambassador to the united states, told reuters, without citing specific measures under review.  kabul has long been critical of pakistan’s role in afghanistan.  pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militants safe haven on its territory. it bristles at u.s. claims that pakistan’s spy agency, the inter services intelligence (isi) directorate, has ties to haqqani network militants blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in afghanistan. a senior pakistani government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, doubted the trump administration would press too hard, saying: “they don’t want to push pakistan to abandon their war against terrorism.” pakistani officials point towards the toll militancy has taken on the country. since 2003, almost 22,000 civilians and nearly 7,000 pakistani security forces have been killed as a result of militancy, according to the south asia terrorism portal, which tracks violence. but the pentagon, in a report to congress released on tuesday, explicitly accused elements of pakistan’s government of supporting afghanistan focused militant groups, including the taliban and haqqani network, who it said retained “freedom of action” within pakistan.  it called pakistan “the most influential external actor affecting afghan stability.” pakistan won the status as a major non nato ally in 2004 from the george bush administration, in what was at the time seen in part as recognition of its importance in the u.s. battle against al qaeda and taliban insurgents. the status is mainly symbolic, allowing limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u.s. military hardware. yanking the title would be seen by pakistan as a major blow. some u.s. officials and experts on the region scoff at the title. “pakistan is not an ally. it’s not north korea or iran. but it’s not an ally,” said bruce riedel, a pakistan expert at the brookings institution think tank.  lisa curtis, prior to becoming senior director for south and central asia at the national security council, co authored a report with husain haqqani, pakistan’s former ambassador to washington, in which they recommended the trump administration warn pakistan the status could be revoked in six months.  “thinking of pakistan as an ally will continue to create problems for the next administration as it did for the last one,” said the february report, published by the conservative hudson institute think tank. it was unclear how seriously the trump administration was considering the proposal. the growing danger to afghanistan from suspected pakistan based militants was underscored by a devastating may 31 truck bomb that killed more than 80 people and wounded 460 in kabul.   afghanistan’s main intelligence agency said the attack   one of the deadliest in memory in the afghan capital   had been carried out by the haqqani network with assistance from pakistan, a charge islamabad denies. washington believes the strikes appeared to be the work of the haqqani network, u.s. officials told reuters. u.s. frustration over the haqqani’s presence in pakistan has been building for years. the united states designated the haqqani network as a terrorist organization in 2012. u.s. navy admiral mike mullen, then the top u.s. military officer, told congress in 2011 that the haqqani network was a “veritable arm” of the isi. any u.s. pivot in its approach would be sharply different than the one taken at the start of the obama administration, when u.s. officials sought to court pakistani leaders, including army chief general ashfaq kayani. david sedney, who served as obama’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for afghanistan, pakistan and central asia from 2009 to 2013, said the attempt to turn islamabad into a strategic partner was a “disaster.” “it didn’t affect pakistan’s behavior one bit. in fact, i would argue it made pakistan’s behavior worse,” sedney said. more drones, cash cut off pakistan has received more than $33 billion in u.s. assistance since 2002, including more than $14 billion in so called coalition support funds (csf), a u.s. defense department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter insurgency operations. last year, the pentagon decided not to pay pakistan $300 million in csf funding after then u.s. secretary of defense ash carter declined to sign authorization that pakistan was taking adequate action against the haqqani network.      u.s. officials said the trump administration was discussing withholding at least some assistance to pakistan. curtis’ report singled out the aid as a target. but u.s. aid cuts could cede even more influence to china, which already has committed nearly $60 billion in investments in pakistan.  another option under review is broadening a drone campaign to penetrate deeper into pakistan to target haqqani fighters and other militants blamed for attacks in afghanistan, u.s. officials and a pakistan expert said. “now the americans (will be) saying, you aren’t taking out our enemies, so therefore we are taking them out ourselves,” said the pakistan expert, who declined to be identified. pakistan’s army chief of staff last week criticized “unilateral actions” such as drone strikes as “counterproductive and against (the) spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence sharing being diligently undertaken by pakistan.” ",0

" the u.s. senate banking committee’s top two lawmakers unveiled a bipartisan piece of legislation on wednesday designed to prevent a prolonged vacancy on the federal body that determines how large insurance companies are regulated. the proposed legislation by senate banking chairman mike crapo and ranking member sherrod brown would permit roy woodall, the independent insurance expert on the financial stability oversight council (fsoc), to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed, or for an additional 18 months. the fsoc is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms, including insurers, as systemic, a tag that carries additional oversight by the federal reserve.  the panel has designated a number of insurers, including prudential financial inc, american international group inc and metlife.  metlife fought the designation in court and won.  the other two still carry the designation, though prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded. a two thirds majority vote of fsoc’s sitting members is needed to rescind a designation. woodall, who previously voted against designating metlife and prudential, is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise. but his six year term expires in september.  as there is no federal insurance regulator, woodall is effectively the most important figure in u.s. regulation of large insurers. the fsoc is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin. all of the fsoc’s other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms, or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy.  but due to a quirk in the dodd frank law, woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires   a problem that could leave a gap on the fsoc. wednesday’s proposed bill will provide “much needed clarity regarding the independent insurance member’s term,” crapo said.  brown added that the fix represents a “commonsense” bipartisan measure. it is also backed by a large list of other republicans and democrats on the panel    a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in congress.

" republicans generally agree that politicians should not enrich themselves while running the country. yet most think it is okay for president donald trump to do so.  democrats largely support the idea of government run healthcare. but their support plummets when they learn that trump once backed the idea.  at a time of already deep fissures among american voters on political, cultural and economic issues, trump further polarizes the public as soon as he wades into the debate, according to the results of a reuters/ipsos poll. the poll suggests any effort to reach a consensus on key policy issues could be complicated simply by trump’s involvement.  the survey from feb. 1 to march 15 of nearly 14,000 people asked respondents to consider a series of statements trump has made on taxes, crime and the news media, among other issues. in many cases, the data showed that people will orient their opinions according to what they think of trump.  republicans, for example, were more likely to criticize american exceptionalism – the notion that the united states holds a unique place in history   when told that trump once said it was insulting to other countries. they were more likely to agree that the country should install more nuclear weapons, and they were more supportive of government spending for infrastructure, when they knew that trump felt the same way.  democrats moved in the opposite direction. they were less supportive of infrastructure spending, less critical of the judiciary and less likely to agree that urban crime was on the rise when they knew that those concerns were shared by trump.  “i’m basically in disagreement with everything he says,” said howard house, 58, a democrat from jacksonville, florida, who took the poll. “i’ve almost closed my mind to the guy.”  trump is not the first president to polarize the public. a 1995 poll by the washington post found that democrats appeared to favor legislative action when they thought it was then president bill clinton’s idea, and a 2013 survey by hart research associates showed that both positive and negative attitudes about the 2010 affordable care act intensified when called by its other name, obamacare.  but previous presidents were more popular than trump at this point, according to the gallup polling service, and they may have been better positioned to address the public divide because of it. gallup had trump at a 42 percent approval rating on tuesday. he was as low as 35 percent last week.  that leaves trump facing a largely disapproving electorate, even as the white house signals that in the coming months it wants to pass a sweeping tax reform package, a large infrastructure plan, and perhaps try again to supplant the affordable care act.  the white house said that trump has tried to reach out to those who did not support him during the campaign in an attempt to build political consensus.  “the door to the white house has been open to a variety of people who are willing to come to the table and have honest discussions with the president about the ways we can make our country better,” a white house spokeswoman wrote in an email.  the hyper partisan era of trump  poll respondents were split into two groups. each received nearly identical questions about statements trump has made in recent years. one group, however, was not told the statements came from trump.  the poll then asked if people agreed or disagreed with those statements. in a few cases, trump made little to no impact on the answers. but most of the time the inclusion of his name changed the results.  a series of questions about conflicts of interest produced the biggest swings.  some 33 percent of republicans said it was okay if “an official” financially benefits from a government position. however, when a separate group was asked the same question with trump’s name added in, more than twice as many republicans – 70 percent – said it was okay.  when interviewed afterward, some respondents said they knew they were making special exceptions for trump.  susie stewart, a 73 year old healthcare worker from fort worth, texas, said it came down to trust. while most politicians should be forbidden from mixing their personal fortunes with government business, stewart, who voted for trump, said the president had earned the right to do so.  “he is a very intelligent man,” stewart said. “he’s proved himself to be one hell of a manager. a builder. i think he has the business sense to do what’s best for the country.”  on the other side of the political spectrum, house, the democrat from florida and a hillary clinton supporter, said he also made an exception for trump. but in this instance it meant that house disagreed with everything trump supported.  if trump said the sky was blue, “i’m going to go outside and check,” he said.  it is impossible to say exactly what motivates people to answer a certain way in a political poll, said john bullock, an expert in partisanship at the university of texas at austin.  some respondents may have looked past the question and answered in a way that they thought would support or oppose trump, bullock said.  but he said it was also likely that others simply have not thought deeply about the issue and are looking to trump as a guide for how to answer.  “they think of him either as a man who shares their values or someone who manifestly does not,” bullock said.

" a swiss federal court has dismissed the asylum appeal of a woman convicted in spain of supporting the basque separatist group eta, but said she was now free to remain in switzerland after madrid dropped her sentence. the case of nekane txapartegi, who said she was tortured while in custody in spain before fleeing in 2007, has drawn considerable attention in switzerland, with members of a  free nekane  movement staging rallies in zurich and other cities. the united nations  special rapporteur on torture and amnesty international had also urged swiss authorities not to extradite txapartegi to spain. on friday the swiss court said the asylum issue was no longer relevant because spain s high court had ruled that her sentence   initially 11 years in jail, later reduced to 3 1/2 years   had reached its statute of limitations.  as with every european citizen, ms. txapartegi may stay in switzerland within the rules of free movement,  a spokesman for the state secretariat for migration said. switzerland is not in the european union but eu citizens can settle there provided they are in gainful employment or can prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves. swiss authorities arrested txapartegi in zurich in april 2016 after they discovered she had been living under an assumed name in switzerland since 2009. they agreed in march this year to extradite her but freed her in september after the spanish decision to drop her jail sentence. txapartegi had told swiss authorities she was tortured into confessing support for eta while in spanish custody. the swiss federal office of justice said at the time she  could  not credibly show that she was actually tortured . on friday the swiss court said that, given the conditions prevailing in spain at the time of her arrest, she may well have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse, but said it no longer needed to evaluate her claims. eta, which killed more than 850 people in a decades long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons.

" hillary clinton said on friday that if elected to the white house she would create an oversight panel to protect u.s. consumers from large price hikes on long available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices. clinton, the democratic presidential candidate, would seek to give the panel an “aggressive new set of enforcement tools,” including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an “unjustified, outlier price increase” on a long available or generic drug, her campaign said. “over the past year, we’ve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long standing, life saving treatments with little or no new innovation or r&d,” clinton said in a statement. if clinton defeats republican rival donald trump in the nov. 8 election, she would need the support of the u.s. congress to implement key measures of her proposal, which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago. even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies, it could be difficult to get republican lawmakers on board, morningstar analyst damien conover said, adding that a “republican congress would push back hard on this.” clinton’s campaign cited turing pharmaceuticals llc’s raising the price of its aids drug daraprim (pyrimethamine) and mylan nv’s repeated steep price increases on epipen for severe allergy sufferers as “troubling” examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. conover said clinton’s plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall. drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies. the arca pharmaceutical index of large u.s. and european drugmakers rose 0.30 percent on friday, in line with gains for the broad stock market. shares of mylan fell 4.6 percent to $40.00 on the nasdaq. the nasdaq biotech index slipped 0.40 percent. the decline was slight compared to the more than 4.7 percent drop in the index seen on sept. 21, 2015, when clinton blasted “price gouging” in the specialty drug market on twitter, responding to reports that turing had acquired daraprim, an older antibiotic, and then hiked its price by 5,000 percent.  soon afterward, clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs, including allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs.  her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out of pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. it aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products, and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising. dr. peter bach, the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at new york’s memorial sloan kettering cancer center, said clinton’s announcement on friday was a “flag” for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes. “it’s a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition,” bach said, saying the campaign was focusing on a “sub category” of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug. bach said he was contacted by the clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity. the oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase, the manufacturer’s production cost and the treatment’s relative value to patients and public health, clinton’s campaign said. terry haines, head of political analysis for evercore isi, said clinton’s proposed panel had little hope of getting through congress.  but clinton, if elected, might be able to achieve price reform via changes to medicare’s prescription drug benefit, known as medicare part d, if she works with congress to reform the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, haines said. in that event, haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come “under sustained headline risk in 2017 as aca reforms are discussed.”         in cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition, clinton’s administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the united states. dr. aaron kesselheim, an associate professor at harvard medical school, called it a “bold idea” to get the federal government “involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets.” until recently, there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the u.s. food and drug administration. although the wait time has shortened, there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the u.s. market, kesselheim said. “having the government get involved as a long term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market,” he said. kesselheim has testified before congress about high cost generic and long available drugs and spoke to clinton’s campaign about his research as it developed its proposals.

" a bipartisan group of u.s. senators reintroduced legislation on thursday to repeal all restrictions on travel to cuba, this time attracting far more co sponsors in a sign of growing support for u.s. cuban detente even as its future looks uncertain. the freedom to travel to cuba act was introduced in 2015 by eight republican and democratic co sponsors but never made it to the floor. the latest measure attracted 55 co sponsors. while efforts to ease the decades old u.s. embargo against cuba have been gathering strength and 55 votes would be a majority in the 100 member senate, that number falls short of the 60 needed to advance the legislation. there was no indication the chamber’s republican leaders would allow the measure to come up for a vote. republican president donald trump threatened during his 2016 election campaign to reverse a normalization of ties with the communist run, caribbean island initiated in 2014 by democratic president barack obama. trump’s administration is reviewing u.s. policy toward the country’s former cold war foe. obama eased trade and travel restrictions, fueling a boom in american visits to cuba, although tourism was still not officially allowed. on wednesday, more than 40 u.s. travel companies and organizations urged trump not to roll back expanded u.s. travel to cuba.  “it is americans who are penalized by our travel ban, not the cuban government,” said u.s. republican senator jeff flake, who with democratic senator patrick leahy led the group that co sponsored the bill. flake added that lifting the ban would give americans more freedom but also benefit the cuban people. “this is certain to have positive benefits for the island’s burgeoning entrepreneurial and private sector.” the number of u.s. visitors rose 74 percent last year, boosting business for cuban hotels, bnbs, restaurants and taxis but also u.s. cruise operators and airlines that entered the market over the past year. “we applaud senators flake and leahy for their leadership in supporting the american and cuban people by eliminating archaic, outdated policy,” said james williams, president of the washington based engage cuba group.  there is still strong congressional opposition to any ending of cuba’s isolation, led by anti castro cuban american lawmakers including republican senator marco rubio and democratic senator robert menendez. they say the united states should not make travel to cuba easier before the havana government moves toward democracy.

" a u.n. human rights expert voiced alarm on friday that u.s. president donald trump might allow torture in interrogations, warning that it “lays down the gauntlet” for other countries to follow suit. trump said in late january he felt “absolutely” that the practice of waterboarding   a form of simulated drowning   worked as an intelligence gathering tool. he also said he would defer on the issue to defense secretary jim mattis, who disagrees with him about its usefulness. u.n. special rapporteur on protecting human rights ben emmerson told the u.n. human rights council that, hearing trump extol torture as a weapon against terrorism shortly after his inauguration “was enough to make my blood run cold”. making his final public comments after six years in the independent post, emmerson later told reporters that trump was the first democratically elected head of state to positively advocate torture.  “that is a state of affairs which lays down the gauntlet, it lays down a precedent.” emmerson, a british barrister and international criminal justice expert, said that trump’s comments showed a “staggering level of ill preparedness to govern.”  emmerson also told reporters that rescinding former president barack obama’s executive order to close the u.s. detention facility at guantanamo bay in cuba would be a “grave retrograde step”. the center was a “legal black hole” for security suspects in custody without charge, he said. the u.s. delegation to the 47 member state forum in geneva did not take the floor to respond. emmerson also said senior officials from george w. bush’s administration should be prosecuted for allowing torture, emmerson added. officials responsible for the secret detention, rendition and torture programs run by the cia included “those in the most senior positions” under bush, he said. gina haspel, a veteran clandestine central intelligence agency (cia) service officer who ran one of the agency’s “black site” prisons set up after the 9/11 attacks, has been named deputy director of the u.s. spy agency. concerns have also been raised about trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, former republican senator dan coats, and his record on the previous u.s. use of so called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. “if one of the most powerful nations in the world, a permanent member of the security council, is once again prepared to abandon our collective values on the pretext of defending them, then one is left to wonder whether anything at all has been achieved in the last 15 years,” emmerson said.

"style technothriller. but if pyongyang’s technicians continue at their current pace, experts say it is becoming ever more likely.  one thing is certain: north korea is plowing considerable resources into building its nuclear capability. and it is clearly making progress – even if tuesday’s failed missile test shows it still has a long way to go.  japanese officials said what appeared to be a conventional musudan rocket, which theoretically has the ability to reach japan and the u.s. territory and military base of guam, exploded either as or shortly after it left its launcher. north korea is estimated to have some 20 to 30 of the missiles – first deployed in 2007, but yet to be launched successfully.  what north korean leader kim jong un wants, most analysts believe, is simple – a rocket that can fire a nuclear warhead at least to regional targets. his ultimate ambition, however, is to be able to hit u.s. cities on the west coast, most likely from a submarine that could hide itself at sea.  north korea has been steadily improving its rockets – which can also carry conventional explosives – for decades. it detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 but most experts believe it has yet to build one small enough to be placed on a missile. having the credible ability to do all of that and get the missiles to sea could take well over a decade, perhaps considerably more.  once it happens, however, it will be a strategic game changer. at worst, u.s. cities on the west coast would have to deal with the prospect, however remote, that they might be struck by a north korean atomic weapon. at the very least, a north korea armed with nuclear submarines would hugely complicate the calculus for any u.s. president handling a crisis on the korean peninsula itself.  that, of course, is exactly the plan.  the fact that pyongyang has conducted so many tests this year, some experts believe, suggests kim is pushing his scientists harder than ever to deliver working rockets and warheads. north korea is believed to have tagged the expertise of russian cold war era scientists, and while its capabilities on both fronts lag well behind established nuclear states such as russia and china, it is already believed to be well ahead of iran.  in april, south korean and u.s. officials said a north korean submarine successfully launched a ballistic missile that traveled some 18 miles — a major step forward.  technical experts say tv footage appeared to show a solid fuel rocket successfully launching from underwater, essentially the same system used by western forces to achieve the same goal.  when she testified before the senate armed services committee in april, the incoming head of the u.s. northern command – responsible for defending the mainland united states – delivered a stark warning.  “the north korean threat is real,” u.s. air force general lori robinson – previously head of u.s. air forces in the pacific – told lawmakers. “for now, it’s a medium range but they are trying very hard to be able to hit the homeland.”  it’s impossible to know exactly how much money and expertise the north koreans are expending. the scale of the effort, however, is seen as large – in many ways, the same level of commitment the united states gave to the manhattan project to build the world’s first atomic bomb during world war two. pyongyang’s reason is clear: building that kind of credible ability to strike is seen as central to the long term survival of the kim dynasty and its ruling party.  earlier this month, at the first meeting of its ruling party in 36 years, kim said north korea was a responsible nuclear weapons state and would never use its weapons – unless it were threatened. that seemed a clear warning to outside powers, particularly washington, to steer clear of any attempts to destabilize or attack the regime.  getting a submarine based deterrent would be a very big deal – and not just because it might allow the north koreans to move the launch point much closer to the target. submarines are central to what nuclear weapons states call a “second strike” capability, the ability to launch missiles even in the aftermath of an overwhelming and perhaps surprise preemptive attack.  the united states, russia, britain and france all retain what they call a “continuous at sea deterrent,” at least one submarine offshore at all times ready to fight back even if the homeland and all other military forces are completely taken out. israel is also believed to have the ability to mount nuclear cruise missiles on its dolphin class conventional submarines, while china is now moving quickly towards new ballistic missile submarines for its own at sea deterrent.  this technology isn’t new – the united states and russia developed it in the late 1950s based in part on plans originally developed to hit nazi german u boats in the dying days of world war two. there is no good reason it should not eventually work for north korea, too.  if and when it does, pyongyang is likely to try to keep its submarines very close to its coasts—and its home defenses—at first. still, once the first nuclear armed submarine exists, japan and the united states might feel political pressure to destroy it.  that would come with considerable risks. the north is known to have huge volumes of conventional artillery based along the south korean border, much of it in range of seoul and its 10 million residents. the risk of those weapons inflicting massive casualties is one of the key factors that has deterred multiple u.s. administrations from considering the kind of preemptive strike on pyongyang’s weapons programs that the united states has threatened against iran.  the korean war – frozen by its 1953 cease fire but never otherwise resolved – may not be over yet.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump’s odds at winning the white house improved significantly after his decisive victory in tuesday’s primary in new hampshire, online betting site ladbrokes plc said on wednesday. trump’s odds for winning the presidency in the november election are now 9/2, compared to 7/1 following the iowa caucuses last week. iowa kicked off the parties’ process of nominating their presidential candidates and in the republican race, the real estate tycoon placed second. his chances of victory in november are now 18 percent, up from 13 percent, putting him second to democrat hillary clinton, whose odds of winning the presidency were even, or 50/50, on wednesday. clinton was roundly beaten by bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, in new hampshire. her odds of winning the presidency slipped from 4/5, or a 56 percent chance at the white house, seen immediately after the iowa caucuses. clinton, a former secretary of state, has for long been the front runner to win the democratic nomination but has been challenged by a surge of support for sanders. “new hampshire couldn’t have worked out much better for trump,” said matthew shaddick, head of political odds at ladbrokes. “this might be bad news for the republican party, but it’s not much better for us bookmakers, who are facing some huge payouts on the one time 100/1 no hoper.” he was referring to trump’s 100/1 odds, giving him a 1 percent chance, when he declared his candidacy last june.  marco rubio, a u.s. senator from florida whose chances for the republican nomination improved after he did well in the iowa caucuses, faces longer odds after his middle of the pack finish in new hampshire. according to ladbrokes, rubio’s odds are now 8/1, giving him an 11 percent chance at becoming president. after iowa, rubio’s odds at becoming president had been  11/4, giving him a 26 percent chance.  ohio governor john kasich, who surged to a surprising second place finish in the new hampshire’s republican primary, still faces relatively long odds of 33/1, giving him a 3 percent chance at winning the presidency. the candidates have embarked on what can be a months long state by state battle to win party support. the parties formally announce their presidential nominees at summer conventions. interest in kasich on social media surged   he received 30,500 mentions on twitter on tuesday, more than four times what he got during the iowa caucuses, according to brandwatch.

" a foreign fighter captured during a raid on islamist militants blamed by egypt for a deadly attack in its western desert last month is a libyan national, the egyptian interior ministry said on thursday.  the captured fighter, abdelrahim mohamed al mesmari, 25, is from the eastern libyan town of derna, an interior ministry statement said.  a little known group called ansar al islam claimed responsibility for the oct. 21 attack. three security sources said at the time that at least 52 police officers and conscripts were killed but the interior ministry refuted that figure the next day and said only 16 policemen had been killed. the new militant group risks opening up another front for security forces far beyond the remote northern sinai, where they have battled an islamic state insurgency since 2014. the egyptian air force killed the 15 militants responsible for the deadly attack and later arrested 29 others for adopting the same ideology, the statement said.  the militants were being trained in derna, it added.

" a federal judge refused to dismiss a criminal indictment against two former allies of new jersey republican governor chris christie over their alleged roles in the 2013 george washington bridge lane closing scandal, known as bridgegate. in a decision made public on tuesday, u.s. district judge susan wigenton, in newark, new jersey, rejected arguments by william baroni and bridget anne kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal. kelly, a former christie deputy chief of staff, and baroni, a former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the september 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in fort lee, new jersey. the closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the world’s busiest, which spans the hudson river to connect new jersey to manhattan. prosecutors said it was intended to punish fort lee’s democratic mayor for not endorsing christie’s successful reelection bid. in her 23 page decision, wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers’ right to travel. “political payback is not a significant government interest,” she wrote. wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former port authority executive david wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors. michael baldassare and michael critchley, lawyers who represent baroni and kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. a trial is scheduled for sept. 12, court records show. christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within new jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run.  both defendants are also seeking records from christie’s cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. critics of christie have called that report biased. separately, a federal appeals court in philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co conspirators. oral arguments were heard on june 6. the case is u.s. v. baroni et al, u.s. district court, district of new jersey, no. 15 cr 00193.

" fiji warned on friday it faces soaring costs to protect itself from climate change and called on the world to do more to curb carbon emissions to protect poor island nations from the increasing threat of floods and cyclones. in a report done with the world bank, the south pacific nation said it is spending almost 10 percent of its gross domestic product to guard against natural disasters, more than quadruple the level of five years ago. the report assessing the country s vulnerability to climate risks was released to coincide with fiji chairing the cop23 global climate summit taking place in bonn.  as the president of the cop23 and on behalf of the small island nations ... fiji is asking the world for drastic action ... so that climate change does not impose a limit to our development,  fijian prime minister voreque bainimarama said in the report. fiji is set to spend more than 350 million fiji dollars ($168 million) this year on relocating villages, building improved bridges and roads and on responding to natural disasters, expected to become more frequent and severe due to climate change.  this is up from just over 50 million fiji dollars, just over 2 percent of gdp, in 2013, the report said.   with increasing risks to the people and economy of fiji due to climate change, finding the capacity to respond will only become more challenging,  it said. the risks include rising sea levels, more floods and landslides, destruction of crops and farm equipment and increases in diseases such as dengue fever, leptospirosis, and typhoid. the effects of climate change already cost the nation around 5 percent of its gdp every year, with the heaviest impact on the farm sector. fiji is still reeling from tropical cyclone winston in march 2016, the most powerful storm to make landfall in the southern hemisphere. the storm killed more than 40 people and caused 2 billion fiji dollars in damage.

" donald trump’s administration is committed to eliminating barack obama’s climate action plan and other environmental initiatives to help boost the oil and gas industry, according to a statement posted on the white house website on friday. the announcement echoed pledges trump frequently made during his campaign to become u.s. president, but their appearance on the white house website makes them his official policy. (bit.ly/2ik2jqp) “president trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the climate action plan and the waters of the u.s. rule. lifting these restrictions will greatly help american workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,” the website said. all references to climate change appeared to have been removed from the white house website, a word search showed. trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the united states on friday.     former president obama’s climate plan proposed cuts to u.s. carbon dioxide emissions, in part by preserving forests and encouraging increased use of cleaner renewable fuels. trump has expressed skepticism about whether human activity drives climate change, and he has railed against obama’s efforts to combat it by targeting carbon dioxide emissions.  trump has also suggested he could pull the united states out of a climate pact agreed by nearly 200 nations. the statement on the white house website said that trump’s efforts to boost the u.s. oil and gas sector would help increase government revenues to “rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure,” and lower the price of energy.  the statement said trump’s administration would free the nation from dependence on foreign oil, and was “committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving america’s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.” an overwhelming majority of scientists say the burning of coal, oil and gas is a driver of global climate change, causing sea level rise and more frequent violent storms.

" the u.s. supreme court on monday turned away a republican challenge to a federal campaign finance restriction that prevents political parties from raising unlimited amounts of cash to spend on supporting candidates. the republican party of louisiana had argued that a provision of the 2002 bipartisan campaign reform act violates free speech rights under the u.s. constitution. but the justices let stand a lower court’s ruling that rejected the republican challenge. the brief order noted that conservative justices clarence thomas and neil gorsuch favored hearing the case. the conservative leaning court in recent years has rolled back campaign finance restrictions. in 2010, the court paved the way to unlimited outside spending on elections in a case called fec v. citizens united that concerned corporate spending. in 2014, the court struck down limits on the total amount individuals can donate during the federal two year election cycle. both those decisions eroded sections of the 2002 law. the measure is commonly known as the mccain feingold law after the two senators who sponsored it, republican john mccain and democrat russ feingold. it barred state and local parties from taking unlimited donations for any activities concerning federal elections. such donations are often called “soft money” because they are unregulated. they were a key target of the 2002 law.  the supreme court has previously turned down similar cases challenging party campaign finance restrictions, including one in 2010 just after the citizens united decision that focused on the national parties and was brought by the republican national committee.

" u.s. civil rights activist deray mckesson released his full platform in the race for baltimore mayor on monday, proposals that include a $15 an hour minimum wage and reforming the police department. mckesson, who was instrumental in the growth of the black lives matter movement, was the last candidate to file paperwork before the campaign deadline this month. “it’s a plan to change baltimore, to make baltimore a place that works for people,” the 30 year old activist said in announcing the plan on the periscope video site. baltimore, a majority african american city, was torn by rioting after a black man, freddie gray, died from an injury in police custody in april. six officers are facing trial in the case.     mckesson, the son of two now recovered drug addicts, had released police reform proposals this month that included banning arrest and citation quotas. he also backs ending civil asset forfeiture and “rough rides” and chokeholds by police.     the teach for america alumnus and former school administrator called for free wifi and broadband access for all residents. he backed reviving a proposed light rail system scuttled by maryland governor larry hogan last year. mckesson, who rose to prominence during the 2014 protests in ferguson, missouri, over the police killing of an unarmed black teenager, said he would hire more inspectors to reduce sources of lead poisoning in children and would expand opportunities for artists in baltimore. mckesson has called for a city minimum wage of $15 an hour, which would be among the highest in the united states. he backs a public bank and more requirements for companies to hire locally. mckesson also is in favor of expanded pre kindergarten classes. he advocates changing state funding formulas so that tax breaks for developers do not cut into  school funding. his distinctive blue patagonia vest has been seen everywhere from street demonstrations to the television show “the late show with stephen colbert.” twenty nine candidates, including 13 democrats, are running to replace mayor stephanie rawlings blake, who is not seeking re election. primary voting for candidates will be held on april 26, with the actual mayoral vote being held on nov. 8 alongside the presidential election.  baltimore has not elected a republican mayor in more than 50 years.

" u.s. vice president mike pence held up venezuela on thursday as a prime example of what happens when democracy is undermined and urged latin american leaders to condemn its government, in comments that venezuela’s president called nauseating. already suffering a severe economic crisis, venezuela, a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, has recently been convulsed by clashes between security forces and anti government protesters. “we need only look to the nation of venezuela to see what happens when democracy is undermined,” pence told the gathering of leaders in miami. “that once rich nation’s collapse into authoritarianism has pushed it into poverty and caused untold suffering for the venezuelan people.” stepping up washington’s war of words with caracas, pence added: “we must all of us raise our voices to condemn the venezuelan government for its abuse of power and its abuse of its own people, and we must do it now.” at least 69 people have died in the unrest in venezuela since early april, with hundreds injured. opposition has been fanned by maduro’s plan for july 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in his favor. the maduro government calls the protesters violent coup mongers, supported by the united states. “i tell the vice president of the united states, get your nose out of venezuela, there will be no gringo, yankee, imperialist intervention in venezuela,” maduro said in a tv broadcast with members of the armed forces. maduro added that he read pence’s comments “and it provokes nausea that a man who doesn’t know where venezuela is on the map gives his opinion about our country.” earlier this month, the united states denounced venezuela for suppressing protests and called for free elections, saying maduro must not be allowed to follow a “dictatorship” path like syrian leader bashar al assad. pence was at a conference to discuss improving security and economic prosperity in central america, specifically in the violent nations of el salvador, guatemala and honduras.  foreign ministers from across the hemisphere will travel to cancun, mexico, next week for a meeting of the organization of american states, where venezuela will be discussed.

" u.s. president donald trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judge’s temporary hold on his travel ban on seven mainly muslim countries, but the outcome of a ruling on the executive order’s ultimate legality is less certain.  any appeals of decisions by u.s. district court judge james robart in seattle face a regional court dominated by liberal leaning judges who might not be sympathetic to trump’s rationale for the ban, and a currently shorthanded supreme court split 4 4 between liberals and conservatives. the temporary restraining order robart issued on friday in seattle, which applies nationwide, gives him time to consider the case in more detail, but also sends a signal that he is likely to impose a more permanent injunction.    the trump administration has appealed that order. the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals said late on saturday that it would not decide whether to lift the judge’s ruling, as requested by the u.s. government, until it receives briefs from both sides, with the administration’s filing due on monday. appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case   for now   is the suspension of the ban.  the upheaval prompted by the new republican administration’s initial announcement of the ban on jan. 27, with travelers detained at airports upon entering the country, would potentially be kickstarted again if robart’s stay was lifted. the appeals court might also take into account the fact that there are several other cases around the country challenging the ban. if it were to overturn the district court’s decision, another judge somewhere else in the united states could impose a new order, setting off a new cascade of court filings.  if the appeals court upholds the order, the administration could immediately ask the u.s. supreme court to intervene. but the high court is generally reluctant to get involved in cases at a preliminary stage, legal experts said. the high court is short one justice, as it has been for a year, leaving it split between liberals and conservatives. any emergency request by the administration would need five votes to be granted, meaning at least one of the liberals would have to vote in favor.  “i think the court’s going to feel every reason to stay on the sidelines as long as possible,” said steve vladeck, a professor at the university of texas school of law. trump last week nominated a conservative appeals court judge, neil gorsuch, to fill the vacancy, but he will not be sitting on the supreme court for at least two months. gorsuch’s vote, if he is confirmed by the u.s. senate, could come into play if the case were to reach the court at a later stage of the litigation. once the case proceeds past the injunction stage of the litigation and onto the merits of whether the order is legally sound, legal experts differ over how strong the government’s case would be.  richard primus, a professor of constitutional law at the university of michigan law school, said the administration could struggle to convince courts that the ban was justified by national security concerns.  the supreme court has previously rejected the idea that the government does not need to offer a basis for its actions in the national security context, including the landmark 1971 pentagon papers case, in which the administration of president richard nixon tried unsuccessfully to prevent the press from publishing information about united states policy toward vietnam. “the government’s argument so far in support of the order is pretty weak,” primus said. jonathan adler, a professor at case western reserve university school of law, said the administration has legal precedent on its side, with the courts generally deferential to executive action on immigration.  however, he said it is unusual for the courts to be asked to endorse “a policy that appears to have been adopted in as kind of haphazard and arbitrary way as this one appears to have been.” ",0
" china s foreign ministry reiterated on thursday that it believes venezuela has the ability to handle its debt issue, after the oil rich country started making interest payments on bonds following a delay that had threatened to trigger a default. venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from russia and china, primarily through oil for loan deals that have crimped the country s hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans.  on wednesday, venezuela won easier debt terms from russia, as well as a vote of confidence from china   two countries that could provide a lifeline as caracas seeks to keep its deeply depressed economy solvent. asked whether china was concerned that the debt would not be repaid, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing that china venezuela financial cooperation was proceeding as normal.  we believe that venezuela s government and people have the ability to properly handle their debt issue,  geng said.  venezuelan bond prices have been on a roller coaster over the past 10 days, as president nicolas maduro called investors to debt restructuring talks, while pledging to keep honoring the country s obligations. but s&p global ratings declared it in selective default on two of its sovereign bonds early this week after it failed to make the coupons within a 30 day grace period. on wednesday, the country s economy ministry said it had started transferring $200 million in interest payments on those bonds, which mature in 2019 and 2024.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency’s watchdog is expanding a review of administrator scott pruitt’s frequent travels to his home state oklahoma to include more recent trips taken on military and charter flights, according to a memo seen on friday. the office of inspector general had been investigating the “frequency, cost and extent” of pruitt’s travels to oklahoma through july 31, and will now expand the “active audit” to include all travel, including the use of private and military flights he has taken up to sept. 30. the expanded review coincides with heightened scrutiny surrounding the travels of president donald trump’s cabinet officials with reports that some have spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for non commercial flights. health and human services secretary tom price resigned last week over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. the interior department’s own inspector general last week confirmed it also opened an investigation into travels by interior secretary ryan zinke after receiving numerous complaints about his use of three chartered flights, including one on an aircraft owned by an oil and gas executive. energy secretary rick perry also used a private charter flight last week, reuters reported. the flight cost $11,000, according to travel records provided to reuters by the department of energy. the records show that perry took four non commercial flights between may and last week totaling nearly $56,000 of taxpayer money. department spokeswoman shaylyn hayes said in a statement on friday that in the “rare instances where government owned or chartered aircraft have been used, trips were pre approved by an ethics officer within the office of general counsel.” separately, a spokeswoman for the energy department’s inspector general office could not confirm nor deny whether it is investigating his travels. in addition to investigating the frequency of pruitt’s travels, the watchdog is also evaluating whether pruitt followed epa travel protocols and whether “epa’s policies and procedures are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud, waste and abuse with the administrator’s travel.” pruitt has taken at least four flights that were either not commercial or military chartered since mid february, according to government records. epa spokeswoman liz bowman said the four non commercial flights had been cleared by epa lawyers. pruitt had also traveled to oklahoma on at least 43 of the 92 days of march, april and may, according to copies of his travel records obtained by the environmental integrity project watchdog and reviewed by reuters last month, which prompted the initial investigation.

" libertarian party presidential candidate gary johnson and green party hopeful jill stein have failed to quality for the first planned u.s. presidential debate on sept. 26, the commission on presidential debates said on friday. the commission, citing the averages the various candidates have achieved in selected polls, confirmed that republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton had met the criteria. it also said that the vice presidential running mates of the two leading candidates were the only two to qualify for the vice presidential debate set for oct. 4. the first presidential debate will be held at hofstra university in hempstead, new york and the vice presidential debate at longwood university in farmville, virginia. using the average of five national polls, clinton scored 43 percent, trump 40.4 percent, johnson 8.4 percent and stein 3.2 percent, the commission said. selection for the debates requires at least 15 percent support. johnson and stein were both constitutionally eligible and had ballot access in enough states to theoretically win an electoral college majority, but missed the polling threshold. stein’s campaign website said she and her running mate ajamu baraka will both attend the first presidential debate, and urged supporters to join them. the campaign said it might ask supporters to attempt to escort the candidates into the debate in an action that “may lead to arrest — it is possible but not definite. there will be actions you can take with us at hofstra that do not risk arrest.” the campaign said it is “organizing nonviolent civil resistance training for this.” johnson said in a statement that: “i would say i’m surprised that the cpd has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but i’m not.” the commission was a private organization created by the republican and democratic parties “for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see,” johnson said. the last time a third party candidate was allowed to participate in the televised debates was in 1992, when ross perot met the requirements running as an independent.

" cambodian prime minister hun sen challenged the united states on sunday to cut all aid after it announced it was ending funding for a general election next year in response to the dissolution of the main opposition party, media reported. hun sen, the strongman who has ruled cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti american line in an increasingly tense run up to a 2018 election that has included a crackdown on critics, rights groups and independent media. the united states announced on friday it was ending funding for the election, and promised more  concrete steps , after the supreme court dissolved the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) at the request of the government, on the grounds it was plotting to seize power. the party denied the accusation. the pro government fresh news website reported that hun sen said in a speech to garment workers that he welcomed the u.s. aid cut and urged it cut it all.  samdech techo hun sen confirmed that cutting u.s. aid won t  kill the government but will only kill a group of people who serve american policies,  fresh news reported, using hun sen s official title.  it did not identify the people suspected of serving u.s. policies but added:  hun sen ... welcomes and encourages the u.s. to cut all aid.  the u.s. embassy in phnom penh did not respond to a request for comment. in april, the u.s. embassy announced a $1.8 million grant to assist local elections this year and next year s general election. the u.s. state department said on its website that u.s. assistance to cambodia for programs in health, education, governance, economic growth and clearing unexploded ordnance was worth more than $77.6 million in 2014. however, chinese support for big ticket projects has allowed hun sen to brush off western criticism of his crackdown on dissent. china vastly outspends the united states in a country once destroyed by cold war superpower rivalry, and its money goes on highly visible infrastructure projects and with no demands for political reform. in september, authorities arrested the cnrp leader, kem sokha, and charged him with treason over what they said was a plot to take power with u.s. help. he denied any such plot. the u.s. state department called on friday for cambodia to release him and reverse the decision to ban his party. the court also banned 118 party members from politics for five years. police have begun to take down cnrp signs from their offices across the country. mu sochua, a senior cnrp member who moved abroad shortly before the party was banned, said hun sen was jeopardizing foreign investment.  foreign investors serious about investing in cambodia won t be coming and are, or will be, looking at an exit if they can t compete with china s monopoly in cambodia because hun sen needs to pay back favors to china,  she said. western countries, which for decades supported cambodia s emergence from war and isolation, have shown little appetite for sanctions in response to the crackdown, but the european union has raised the possibility of cambodia losing trade preferences. tariff free access to europe for cambodian garments   and similar trade preferences in the united states   have helped cambodia build a garment industry on low cost labor. eu and u.s. buyers take some 60 percent of cambodia s exports.

" in the middle of a confused three day scramble by u.s. republicans to save their plan to dismantle obamacare, president donald trump telephoned a former small town sandwich shop owner from the north carolina mountains on wednesday afternoon. representative mark meadows took the call during a meeting of the freedom caucus, a conservative faction of the house of representatives he chairs. his talk with trump thrust meadows into the eye of a legislative storm that led to a pivotal vote on the bill being postponed. then, late on thursday after trump demanded action by the house, a final vote was set for friday. through it all, meadows has been a key player in trump’s first major legislative initiative, an effort as chaotic and unpredictable as his campaign for the white house, with its ultimate outcome still in doubt late on thursday night. after promising for months as a candidate to repeal and replace obamacare, trump has still not produced his own plan to do so, choosing instead to support a rollback bill drafted by senior house republicans, including house speaker paul ryan. financial markets have watched the drama over the bill nervously, concerned that defeat or delay for it could undermine trump’s ability to carry through on promises to cut taxes and reduce regulation that have lifted u.s. stocks for weeks. in a schism among republicans who now control congress and the white house, moderates oppose ryan’s bill, saying it goes too far. the non partisan congressional budget office has estimated it would result in 24 million fewer americans having insurance by 2026 than if obamacare remained in place intact. meadows and the freedom caucus don’t like it either, but for very different reasons, making a compromise challenging. they say it doesn’t go far enough to repeal the healthcare law put in place in 2010 by former democratic president barack obama.  to deal with this problem, trump stepped in personally earlier this week to try to win over meadows and his maverick conservative faction, according to interviews with dozens of lawmakers and congressional aides. but, even after marathon phone calls and meetings at the white house, trump, who prides himself as a master negotiator, failed to secure the deal. meadows told reporters on thursday night he still opposed the bill, but was optimistic that a deal could be reached. “i am still a no,” he said, taking basically the same position he took on wednesday afternoon after his phone call with trump. when he embraced ryan’s bill and then decided to intervene to try to save it, trump opted for a strategy in which he would concentrate on winning over meadows and the conservatives. ryan and house leaders would deal with “everybody else,” republican representative tom rooney said thursday. that strategic approach soon had embarrassing consequences. trump’s push began in earnest on tuesday, when he visited capitol hill seeking support for the plan among republicans. on wednesday, the house rules committee held marathon meetings to finalize the bill that would go to the floor. after his wednesday phone call with the president, meadows spent much of wednesday night negotiating with trump, said a republican lawmaker. “mark meadows has been at the white house more in the last 48 hours than any other times in his life combined,” said one conservative lobbyist with knowledge of internal discussions. as meadows and other freedom caucus members such as representative jim jordan negotiated with trump, more and more right wing amendments were added to the bill to placate conservatives. the conservative concessions hurt moderates. “the vast majority of us in the republican conference have been left out of these discussions,” representative bradley byrne said thursday. “that is a growing problem for our leadership and i think it’s a growing problem for the chances of this bill.” at some point, ryan himself balked when he learned of the agreements struck between trump and the conservatives, according to the conservative lobbyist, setting in motion a frantic push to save a vote on the bill that had been set for thursday. by late afternoon, that rescue effort had collapsed and the vote was scrapped. trump responded forcefully, dispatching top white house lieutenants to a meeting with lawmakers with a clear message: the president was done negotiating. the message was “it’s done tomorrow or obamacare stays,” said republican representative chris collins. with that, lawmakers announced that a decisive vote on the bill would be held on friday afternoon. earlier, even as the vote that had been set for thursday was falling apart, trump was meeting with trucking industry representatives and gleefully climbed into the cab of an 18 wheeler. he said then that everyone would find out in a couple of hours whether republicans had enough votes to pass the healthcare bill, unaware that the vote had already been delayed.

" saudi king salman told u.s. president donald trump that any decision to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of muslims, saudi state owned media said on tuesday. they said that king salman had received a telephone call from trump about developments in the region and the world.  the custodian of the two holy mosques asserted to his excellency the u.s. president that any american announcement regarding the situation of jerusalem prior to reaching a permanent settlement will harm peace talks and increase tensions in the area,  state news agency spa said. it quoted king salman as saying that saudi arabia supported the palestinian people and their historic rights and asserted that  such a dangerous step is likely to inflame the passions of muslims around the world due to the great status of jerusalem and the al aqsa mosque...

" when president barack obama leaves office on jan. 20 after eight years, several of his major initiatives will still hang in the legal balance, meaning the u.s. courts and his successor will play a major role in shaping his legacy. ongoing legal challenges by republican governed states and business groups are targeting obama’s signature healthcare law, his plan to combat climate change, a key immigration initiative, his transgender rights policy, his “net neutrality” internet rules, overtime pay for workers and other matters. most of the cases are awaiting rulings by trial judges or regional federal appeals courts and could be bound for the u.s. supreme court, but are unlikely to get there until after the winner of tuesday’s election, pitting democrat hillary clinton against republican donald trump, is sworn in.  unless the u.s. senate changes course and confirms obama’s nominee, appellate court judge merrick garland, to fill the vacant ninth seat on the ideologically split supreme court, the next president would be responsible for selecting a new justice who could cast the deciding vote in these cases.  the supreme court has already agreed to decide a major transgender rights case. obama’s administration is backing a female born transgender high school student named gavin grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school’s boys’ bathroom. a ruling, which also could resolve similar litigation around the country, is not due until the end of june. in another transgender rights case, a number of states challenged the obama administration’s may guidance to public schools nationwide to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. a federal judge blocked the policy in august while the litigation continues. because obama during much of his presidency has faced a republican controlled congress hostile to his legislative initiatives, he has often bypassed lawmakers and used executive power to advance policy goals. “despite having majorities in both houses of congress, republicans have refused to govern. instead, this litigious republican party has rushed to the courts with partisan lawsuits,” white house spokesman eric schultz said. those challenging obama have vowed to fight on unless his successor changes course. “should a new administration rescind those policies and respect the bounds placed before it, we will happily direct our energies elsewhere,” added republican texas attorney general ken paxton, who has helped spearhead various legal challenges to obama. clinton, backed by obama in her white house bid, could be expected to leave in place or even expand on his initiatives and to defend them in court. trump, if elected, could quickly reverse obama executive orders as promised. but undoing large scale regulations like power plant emissions rules could be more complicated.  “it’s not at the stroke of a pen,” said sean donahue, a lawyer representing environmental groups that backed obama administration climate rules known as the clean power plan. trump would have to undergo a new, lengthy rule making process, according to legal experts. the case with the biggest potential long term impact is the challenge by states and industry groups to obama’s clean power plan, which would curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal fired power plants. the rules are an important legacy issue for obama. they also are vital to u.s. obligations under last year’s international climate change treaty. a federal appeals court heard oral arguments in september. a ruling is not due for months. the case is likely to go to the supreme court on appeal. the supreme court put the regulations on hold in february while the litigation continues. republicans and conservative groups have launched numerous challenges to the 2010 affordable care act, known as obamacare. the supreme court in 2012 and 2015 issued rulings preserving obama’s top legislative achievement.  now, another republican led legal challenge is making its way through the courts. the administration has appealed a district court judge’s may decision that the federal government cannot spend billions of dollars to provide subsidies under obamacare to help individuals buy policies from private insurers without congressional approval. separately, the administration is seeking in federal court in texas to revive obama’s 2014 executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. the plan, challenged by texas and other states, has been barred by the courts. the supreme court, split 4 4, in june left in place lower court orders blocking the plan, and in october declined to revisit that ruling.  other obama regulations have been targeted by business groups. a federal appeals court in june upheld obama’s landmark “net neutrality” rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. the case remains under appeal. in september, states and business groups filed a legal challenge to an administration rule to extend mandatory overtime pay to millions of workers. a ruling is not due until after obama leaves office. graphic: courts weigh obama legacy   here ",0
" s&p global ratings warned on thursday that the credit rating for key alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the state’s long term fiscal problems.  alaska governor bill walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal 2017 and closing the state’s nearly $4 billion deficit, which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices.  s&p on thursday put the state’s aa plus general obligation, aa appropriation, and a plus moral obligation ratings on alaska’s debt on creditwatch with negative implications.  the bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation related projects.  “the creditwatch placement indicates that we may lower alaska’s credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state’s structural budget deficit,” said gabriel petek, a s&p global ratings credit analyst.  since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a $4.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2017 and a bill to reduce the cost of the state’s oil and gas tax credit program, s&p said.  but it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the state’s permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state house of representatives. the bill, sb 128, would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund. even if it passes, s&p said it remains to be seen whether sb 128 and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put alaska’s fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory.  “enactment of sb 128 alone would shrink the deficit, but it wouldn’t eliminate it. in order to fully close the structural fiscal gap, other measures – such as new income tax or more spending cuts – would also be necessary,” s&p said.  despite the budget deficit, s&p said alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high.

" the newly elected opposition governor of venezuela s western zulia state was dismissed on thursday by the pro government local state legislature, adding to disarray among foes of the ruling socialists.  the sacking of juan pablo guanipa, one of five opposition governors in venezuela s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all powerful national legislative superbody aligned with president nicolas maduro s ruling socialists.   they held a secret, express session to remove him,  guanipa s spokeswoman erika gutierrez told reuters of the morning meeting of zulia s state legislature.   venezuela s opposition democratic unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month s state elections. despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over venezuela s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five states compared to 18 for maduro s socialist party candidates. opposition leaders blamed dirty tricks by the government, including the last minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, along with abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year. driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro maduro constituent assembly could take office.  four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but guanipa said he would never  kneel before the dictatorship.   this is an assault on the will of the people,  he tweeted after his removal on thursday, denouncing a  coup  in the oil rich state on the border with colombia. opposition in fighting prior to this week, the opposition, along with various major foreign nations including the united states, had refused to recognize the constituent assembly.  elected in july after four months of anti maduro protests, the body has overridden the opposition run national congress.  one major opposition leader, henrique capriles, said he would no longer participate in the coalition while henry ramos, leader of the democratic action party whose four governors swore themselves in before the assembly, was a member. capriles  justice first party, and the popular will party of detained opposition leader leopoldo lopez, have called for a complete reformulation of the opposition grouping. officials from maduro down have been rubbing their hands in glee at the opposition implosion, and cheekily urging the controversial ramos   a polarizing figure unpopular among young opposition militants   to stand for president in 2018.  backstabbing has broken out in the opposition, all against all,  crowed maduro earlier this week. the constituent assembly also announced on thursday local mayoral elections would be held in december, giving the opposition a short time frame to develop strategy.  popular will has already said it plans to boycott that vote. young protesters, who saw hundreds of their fellow demonstrators jailed, injured or even killed in anti maduro street protests earlier this year, are disgusted by what for them is now a bleak political scenario. more than 125 people, including supporters of both sides plus security officials and bystanders, died in four months of unrest that maduro said amounted to a u.s. backed coup attempt.  let the people continue speaking loud and clear in defense of peace, sovereignty and the sacred right to self determination,  constituent assembly head delcy rodriguez said, announcing the december municipal vote that the socialists now expect to win handily given the opposition s disillusionment.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   police in north carolina sought leads on monday about a fire they believe was deliberately set at a local republican headquarters over the weekend and a graffiti message warning the political party to “leave town or else.” investigators are treating the incident as arson. the fire caused heavy damage to the orange county republican party’s office in hillsborough, north carolina, about 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of raleigh.  “this is political terrorism,” said dallas woodhouse, executive director of the north carolina republican party.  both republican presidential nominee donald trump and democratic rival hillary clinton condemned the attack. north carolina is considered a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the nov. 8 presidential contest. “we are taking this incident very seriously and have significant resources at the local, state and federal level committed to this investigation,” hillsborough police chief duane hampton said in a statement on monday, asking anyone with information to come forward. hillsborough police said a bottle containing flammable material ignited after being thrown through a front window of the headquarters between midnight and about 9 a.m. on sunday, when a nearby business owner reported the crime. “someone has firebombed through the window (of) the republican party up here beside me and sprayed all over the side of my building, ‘nazi republicans leave town or else,’” the caller told a 911 operator in a call released on monday. a swastika also was spray painted on the neighboring building, police said. they said no one was in the party office at the time, but the substance burned furniture and charred campaign signs. white house spokesman josh earnest praised the efforts of self described democrats who raised about $13,000 in an online gofundme campaign to help republicans reopen the office. “that’s consistent with the values that we lift up in this country,” he said at a news briefing. “there is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda.” in a tweet on sunday, clinton said she was grateful no one was hurt in the attack, which she called “horrific and unacceptable.” trump blamed his democratic opponent’s supporters for the crime. “animals representing hillary clinton and dems in north carolina just firebombed our office in orange county because we are winning,” he said on twitter. registered democrats far outnumber republicans in orange county, according to elections board data.  republicans said the incident took them by surprise but left them undeterred as they started clean up efforts at their strip mall headquarters and worked in a bus being used as a temporary mobile office.  “we’re not going to be intimated; we’re not going to be cowed,” woodhouse said.  on monday, the arizona republican party headquarters in phoenix was evacuated for about two hours after a bomb threat was left by phone. police said nothing was found during a search of the premises.  party officials said the call was received from an adult male at about 3:15 p.m. local time saying there was a bomb in the building and for occupants to get out.

" the trump administration is reviewing whether it will reaffirm the goal of a world without nuclear weapons, a white house aide said on tuesday, referring to an aim embraced by previous republican and democratic presidents and required by a key arms control treaty. christopher ford, the national security council’s senior director for weapons of mass destruction and counter proliferation, said an examination of whether global nuclear disarmament “is a realistic goal,” would be conducted as part of a wider assessment called the nuclear policy review. ford also said the administration is reviewing responses to russia’s deployment of nuclear capable cruise missiles, which  washington has denounced as a violation of the intermediate range nuclear forces (inf) treaty. he downplayed the chances of new u.s. russia strategic nuclear arms cuts and said washington would for now adhere to the iran nuclear deal. in negotiations scheduled to open next week, the administration also will oppose   as the obama administration did   an international treaty abolishing nuclear weapons, he said.  ford, the only senior nuclear policy official appointed by president donald trump since he took office in january, spoke to a nuclear policy conference put on annually by the carnegie endowment for international peace, a washington based think tank. his comments were the first by a top administration official that gave some indication of white house thinking on nuclear arms policy following a series of provocative comments and tweets that trump made during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. nuclear free world trump has said that while would like to see nuclear weapons abolished, he wants the united states to have an unrivaled arsenal. he also said that the united states has “fallen behind” in its nuclear capabilities, even though it is in the midst of a 30 year, $1.3 trillion drive to modernize what most experts agree is the world’s most powerful nuclear force. trump has supported the development of nuclear weapons by japan, south korea and saudi arabia, called for using nuclear arms against the islamic state militant group and denounced the iran nuclear deal as “a disaster” that he would “rip up.” ford, a lawyer who has served as a republican congressional staffer and a state department arms control official, said he could not comment on many issues until the nuclear posture review, or npr, and other security and foreign policies reviews are completed. experts expect the review to take as long as a year. he also stressed that the reviews may result in continuing to follow policies pursued by former president barack obama. but he said one issue being examined is whether the administration would reaffirm u.s. adherence to the goal of eventual global nuclear disarmament, an objective reaffirmed by obama in an april 2009 speech in prague. “we are reviewing policy across the board,” ford said. “that necessarily includes reviewing, among many other things, whether the goal of a world without nuclear weapons is in fact a realistic objective in the near to medium term in light of current trends in the international security environment.” for decades, ford said, there has been tension between the u.s. desire for nuclear arms abolition and the need to maintain “a robust and effective arsenal that is capable of ensuring our security and that of our allies in europe and the broader asia pacific region against both nuclear and non nuclear threats.” an increasingly unstable world and growing threats to u.s. national security demand a review of “whether traditional u.s. fidelity to that visionary end state of abolition and demonstrating fidelity to it by pointing to rapid progress in reducing arsenals is still a viable strategy,” he said. daryl kimball, executive director of the arms control association, a washington think tank, said the united states is legally bound to that goal as a signatory of the 1968 non proliferation treaty, the bedrock accord of the international system for halting the spread of nuclear weapons.

" u.s. officials are discussing whether to withhold a portion of u.s. assistance to egypt to protest egyptian passage of a law that imposes restrictions on non governmental organizations, a senior administration official said on wednesday. officials have not reached an agreement on whether to proceed with a recommendation to president donald trump and his senior leadership, but there is a feeling that some action is necessary in reaction to the move by egypt, the official told reuters. u.s. aid to egypt has long been sacrosanct. egypt is one of washington’s closest allies in the middle east, receiving $1.3 billion in u.s. military aid and about $200 million in economic assistance annually. “we told them over and over again don’t do this, that they are putting at risk u.s. aid, but they did it anyway,” the official said. “we’re figuring out how to respond.” the discussions involve cutting off a portion of american aid, not all of it, the official said. the egyptian law restricts ngo activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to give years for non compliance. egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. the government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. in may, when the law was issued after being ratified by president abdel fattah al sisi, u.s. senators criticized it. senators john mccain and lindsey graham called it “draconian legislation” and they said the u.s. congress should in response “strengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on u.s. assistance for egypt.”  u.s. senator marco rubio, a florida republican, and nine other senators sent trump a letter on june 19 urging the president to press sisi on the issue. “the u.s. congress will take the egyptian government’s recent actions into consideration as we review our bilateral assistance to egypt to ensure that the american people’s tax dollars are used appropriately,” the letter said. u.s. president barack obama froze aid to egypt for two years after sisi, then a general, overthrew islamist president mohamed mursi in mid 2013 after mass protests against mursi’s rule. trump has been intent on rebooting the bilateral relationship with sisi and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in new york last september. trump gave sisi firm backing and vowed to work together to fight islamist militants when sisi visited the white house in april.

" conservative republicans in the u.s. house of representatives have taken a hard line stance on yet another issue: the august recess. the house freedom caucus, known for bucking republican leadership on legislation including healthcare, has taken an official position on the traditional five week break congress takes from washington: they don’t want it. the freedom caucus supports “the house staying in session through the august recess to continue working to accomplish the priorities of the american people,” according to a brief statement the group issued late tuesday. a spokeswoman for republican house speaker paul ryan, ashlee strong, dismissed the idea of skipping the summer break. she said republicans intend to stick to their agenda. republicans control both the house and senate, but congress has failed to pass major legislation yet this year. republican president donald trump urged legislative leaders on tuesday to finish an overhaul of the healthcare system this summer. the white house also wants faster action on another trump priority: tax cuts. but there are just seven weeks left until the august break   and one of them, the first week of july, congress will be out to mark the july 4 independence day holiday. an attempt to repeal and replace former president barack obama’s affordable care act passed the house in may but has not advanced in the senate. freedom caucus leaders played a key role in first blocking the house healthcare legislation, then enabling it to pass after amendments were added allowing states to apply for waivers from insurance provisions that cover consumers with pre existing conditions.

" john anderson, a former republican congressman who challenged the party’s conservative drift by taking on its chief symbol, ronald reagan, and ran for president as an independent in 1980, died on sunday. he was 95. anderson had been ill for some time, family friend dan johnson told reuters in a telephone interview. anderson’s wife, keke, and his daughter diane were at his side when he died in washington, diane anderson said by phone.  anderson finished a distant third with almost 7 percent of the vote in the 1980 presidential election but gave almost 6 million voters an alternative to the conservative reagan   who won the election   and the unpopular democratic president, jimmy carter. but anderson did not win a single precinct and political analysts said he ultimately may have contributed to reagan’s electoral landslide by taking votes from carter. anderson’s first venture into politics came in 1956 when he was elected as a state attorney in illinois. in 1960, he won the first of 10 terms in the u.s. house of representatives running as a conservative. he later moved to the left, breaking with conservatives in 1968 by voting for a bill to outlaw racial discrimination in housing. anderson served as chairman of the house republican conference for the next 10 years even as he became more critical of republican president richard nixon, especially on his handling of the vietnam war. he was one of the first republican house members to call for nixon’s resignation over the watergate scandal. “he’s the smartest guy in congress, but he insists on voting his conscience instead of party,” republican u.s. representative gerald ford, who later become president, said of anderson in 1973. in 1980, with carter low in the opinion polls and his administration mired in the iran hostage crisis, many republicans, including anderson, jumped into the party’s presidential primaries for a chance to oppose the democrat in the november election. reagan, who had come close to winning the republican presidential nomination in 1976, quickly moved to the front of the race, with his main opponent being former u.n. ambassador george h.w. bush. anderson dropped out of the republican primaries in the spring of 1980 and announced he was running as an independent. when he entered the race, he was enthusiastically greeted as an alternative to the major parties, getting around 25 percent support in at least one poll. but his poll numbers began sliding, even though he was seen as having bested reagan in surveys after a televised debate with the republican presidential nominee. carter boycotted that debate and refused to face reagan if anderson was included. carter finally agreed to a debate with reagan shortly before the election, when the sponsoring league of women voters agreed not to invite anderson. four years later, anderson’s break with conservative republicans was complete and he supported democratic presidential nominee walter mondale, who lost to reagan in a landslide. born in rockford, illinois, on feb. 15, 1922, anderson was educated at the university of illinois urbana champaign and harvard law school. he served in the second world war and joined the foreign service, stationed in germany, his family said in a statement.  after his presidential defeat, anderson became a visiting professor at various universities, wrote extensively and served on many boards including fairvote, a voting rights organization formerly known as the center for voting and democracy. in the 2000 presidential election, anderson was seen as a possible presidential candidate for the reform party founded by texas billionaire ross perot, but he ended up endorsing ralph nader.	 diane anderson said her father believed the two party system was broken and was appalled by what happened with the republican party.  “everything he wanted to prevent unfortunately came to pass,” she said.

" panama has agreed to extradite a former state governor from mexico s ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) who is wanted in his homeland on corruption charges, the two countries said on monday. roberto borge, who from 2010 to 2016 was governor of the state of quintana roo, home to the tourist resort cancun, was detained in panama city airport in june with the aid of interpol as he was preparing to board a flight to paris. corruption promises to be one of the major issues in mexico s july 2018 presidential election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict of interest rows that have dogged the cabinet and president enrique pena nieto himself. the law bars mexican presidents from seeking re election. mexican prosecutors accuse borge of using funds obtained illegally, embezzlement and abuse of public office. the mexican foreign ministry and the attorney general s office said in a statement panama s foreign ministry had notified borge that the extradition was going ahead. panama s foreign ministry said in a separate statement that, after being notified, borge announced that he would have his lawyers appeal against the extradition. the ministry did not give details of how the mexican aimed to justify his appeal. borge had long been accused of corruption by opposition parties, although he has denied the allegations. other former pri governors are also facing prosecution in the run up to next year s presidential contest. javier duarte, who governed the mexican state of veracruz for the pri until last year, was extradited from guatemala to mexico on july 17. he is accused of embezzlement and engaging in organized crime.

" united nations aid chief mark lowcock warned on wednesday that if a saudi led military coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to yemen then it would cause  the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims.  the saudi led military coalition fighting the houthi movement in neighboring yemen said on monday it had closed all air, land and sea ports to the arabian peninsula country to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. the move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward the saudi capital riyadh on saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in yemen that according to the united nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left nearly 900,000 infected with cholera. lowcock, who visited yemen late last month, briefed the u.n. security council behind closed doors at the request of sweden.   i have told the council that unless those measures are lifted ... there will be a famine in yemen,  he told reporters.  it will be the largest famine the world has seen for many decades with millions of victims.  he said u.n. secretary general antonio guterres spoke with saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir earlier on wednesday and called for an immediate resumption of humanitarian access. lowcock said the u.n. s world food programme was feeding seven million people a month in yemen.  what we need is a winding down of the blockade ... so that we can save the lives of those people,  he said.  the u.n. security council expressed concern about the humanitarian situation, italian u.n. ambassador sebastiano cardi, council president for november, said after lowcock s briefing.   the members of the security council emphasized ... the importance of keeping all yemen s ports and airports functioning, including hodeidah port, as a critical lifeline for humanitarian support and other essential supplies,  cardi said. the united nations and international aid organizations have long criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north yemen, which is held by the iran aligned houthi movement.  humanitarian access through the ports was inadequate even before the measures that were announced on the 6th november,  said lowcock, adding that there had also been no u.n. flights allowed into yemen since monday. the saudi led coalition has been targeting the houthis since they seized parts of yemen in 2015, including the capital sanaa, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee. lowcock called for an immediate resumption of u.n. and other aid flights to sanaa and aden, assurances from the coalition that there would be no further disruptions to those flights, and immediate resumption of humanitarian and commercial port access. he also called for the coalition to allow a wfp ship to be pre positioned off aden and assurances that there would be no further disruption to its functions and demanded that all vessels that have passed u.n. inspection be allowed to offload.

" mudassir, 18, from pakistan s city of peshawar has tried to enter the european union 30 times but was always caught and sent back to his starting point in serbia.  now, he and dozens of other migrants are braving near freezing temperatures in shrubs and fields near sid, a northwestern serbian town just outside european union s member croatia, hoping to make another border run.  they spend nights in tents and makeshift shelters in a shrub they call   the jungle.   i have tried 30 times, i am in serbia for 16 months, ... i am tired of sleeping in the  jungle ,  said mudassir, dressed in a black hooded jacket. meanwhile, other migrants, all young males, huddled outside an abandoned printing factory in the outskirts of sid, waiting for a meal delivered by an international volunteer group, the no name kitchen.  the so called balkan route for migrants was shut last year when turkey agreed to stop the flow in return for eu aid and a promise of visa free travel for its own citizens. but people mainly from the middle east, africa and asia continued to arrive in serbia, mainly from turkey, via neighboring bulgaria, attempting to enter croatia and the eu. according to official data there are as many as 4,500 migrants in government operated camps in serbia. rights activists say that hundreds are scattered in the capital belgrade and towns along the croatian border.  muhammad, 22 from the moroccan town of oujda, said he has tried to reach the eu 26 times. three times he made it to slovenia, but was caught and deported back to serbia.  i will try again ... my family is in france and my girlfriend is in italy,  muhammad said. bruno alvares of the no name kitchen said migrants are given two meals a day, water, clothes, footwear and tents.   even if it is cold, it doesn t matter, they will keep on trying because there s ... no evolution in their lives in camps,  alvares said.  migrants who cannot afford to pay smugglers, often hide in passing trucks and freight trains or ride on the top of them. recently an afghan girl was killed by a train as she and her family attempted to cross into croatia.

" australia s lawmakers have rejected legislation that would tighten citizenship and foreign worker visa rules, a blow to prime minister malcolm turnbull who had sought to stop a loss of his support base to far right political parties. in april, turnbull said australia would abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a new program requiring better english language and job skills. turnbull also announced plans to raise the bar for citizenship by lengthening the waiting period and adding a new  australian values  test. but australia s senate, where turnbull s center right government does not enjoy a majority, rejected the proposal in a late vote on wednesday, with opposition lawmakers insisting the rules were counter to australian multicultural values. the senate rejection may further drag on support for turnbull, which, according to the widely watched newspoll poll on monday, languishes at its lowest level in more than two years. the next election is not due until 2019, but continued poor polling could undermine turnbull s leadership. mathias cormann, australia s special minister of state, said on wednesday the government will seek to move the legislation through the senate again as soon as they have secured the necessary support.  we will keep working with all non government senators to secure the necessary support,  cormann told australian broadcasting corporation radio. a spokeswoman for australian immigration minister peter dutton said visa applications would now be considered under the previous rules.

" british prime minister theresa may should address the european parliament when she visits the eu legislature to clarify britain s plans for its divorce from the european union, the parliament s brexit coordinator said on tuesday.  on brexit, i m very pleased that mrs. may has accepted the invitation of the european parliament to come to the european parliament,  guy verhofstadt told a news conference at the parliament in strasbourg. may had accepted an invitation from the parliament to speak at a meeting of the heads of party groupings, he said.  but my proposal is that instead of only addressing the conference of presidents, i would encourage her to address the full house,  verhofstadt said. verhofstadt said a may address would be very helpful because the parliament had to give its approval to a brexit agreement between the eu and britain, notably on the question of citizens  rights, a divorce bill and the future ireland/northern ireland border.  so in the future, all this, i think needs to be debated in an open dialogue between mrs. may and all members,  verhofstadt said, adding he did not know when may planned to visit. verhofstadt pointed out that other leaders had done so in the past. they have included former u.s. president ronald reagan, former french president nicolas sarkozy, as well as britain s queen elizabeth in 1992 and two popes. the parliament s brexit coordinator also said that, for the moment, negotiations had not made sufficient progress on the divorce issues to allow talks to move to the issue of future trade relations between britain and the bloc. he added that the parliament would debate a motion in early october on whether enough progress had been made.

" a group of elder republican statesmen, including three former cabinet members, said they will meet with white house officials on wednesday to propose a $40 per ton tax on carbon emissions to fend off global climate change. the proposal echoes past attempts by parts of the republican party to address climate change but could be a non starter. republican president donald trump has cast doubt on the existence of climate change and vowed during his campaign for the presidency to pull the united states out of a global pact to fight it. “mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore,” the group said in an opinion piece published by the new york times and the wall street journal late on tuesday. “now that the republican party controls the white house, both chambers of congress and a majority of state legislatures, it has the opportunity and responsibility to promote a climate plan that showcases the full power of enduring conservative convictions,” they said. an overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels is driving global climate change, triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. the carbon tax proposal was co authored by james baker, secretary of state during the administration of george h. w. bush; henry paulson, treasury secretary under george w. bush; george shultz, secretary of state under ronald reagan; and several others.  the group said in a press release they would meet with “senior white house officials in two separate meetings” on wednesday to present their proposal. their plan calls for a $40 per ton carbon tax that rises over time, in which all of the revenues are returned to americans in the form of quarterly dividends administered by the social security administration. the plan would also call for “significant regulatory rollback” of former democratic president barack obama’s climate initiatives, including the repeal of his clean power plan aimed at curbing carbon output from states. a white house official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the full plan is at www.clcouncil.org/ ",0

" the french island of martinique escaped hurricane maria largely unscathed but a communications blackout with guadeloupe meant it would be several more hours before damage there could be assessed, a senior french civil protection official said on tuesday. maria, the second major storm to hit the caribbean this month, lashed guadeloupe s southern shores as it tracked northwest toward the virgin islands and puerto rico.  in martinique, reconnaissance operations are still underway but already we can see that there is no significant damage,  jacques witkowski, france s head of civil protection and crisis response, told a news briefing in paris. he said the hurricane was currently less than 70 km (43.5 miles) south of guadeloupe.  right now we re in a blackout zone, so it s very, very hard to communicate with guadeloupe,  witkowski said.    video footage released by the guadeloupe prefecture showed tree bending winds whipping through deserted streets and shaking lamp posts when the storm first hit. it urged residents to stay indoors and take shelter in their most secure room. guadeloupe prefect eric maire said up to 400 millimeters of rain were forecast in some parts of the island. a storm surge could also flood low lying coastal areas.  we ve already got some early information of flooding, flooded houses and submerged roads,  maire said in a video recording posted on the prefecture s twitter handle. airport group guadeloupe pole caraibes said guadeloupe s main international airport would be closed until at least 14:00 local time (1800 gmt) on tuesday.

" president donald trump will sign an order on tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the united states, administration officials said on sunday. under trump, the u.s. environmental protection agency is aiming to aggressively roll back obama era environmental regulations.  trump plans to sign the executive order at the epa to reduce “unnecessary regulatory obstacles that restrict the responsible use of domestic energy resources,” a white house official said. epa administrator scott pruitt told abc’s “this week” the order would help reverse the obama administration’s anti fossil fuel strategy. pruitt has publicly doubted the scientific consensus that human actions are the lead cause of climate change. his installation at the epa last month reinforced the view on both sides of the political divide that america is ceding its position as a leader in the global fight on climate change.

" philippine immigration authorities freed four east timor delegates after holding them for 12 hours at manila airport in a security clampdown ahead of the asean and east asia summit next week. the four east timorese were allowed into the philippines but authorities kept their passports until a formal order is issued clearing their entry, said rhoda viajar, media relations of the asean civil society conference/asean people s forum. immigration authorities said the four were held upon arrival on saturday morning because they could not explain the purpose of their travel and were  not able to establish financial capacity for the visit .  the civil society conference organizers understand the more stringent security measures being implemented due to the upcoming asean summit,  viajar said. she said they  remain concerned about the possibility of similar incidents upon the arrival of many more participants from other countries . since 2005, asean leaders have held a dialogue with the region s top civil society groups to listen to development concerns and address critical issues such as poverty, health and education. philippines security forces are deploying nearly 60,000 army and police personnel during the nov. 10 14 asean and east asia summit to ensure the safety of 19 world leaders and thousands of delegates from 10 southeast asian nations and 10 other dialogue partners, including u.s. president donald trump.  we have not monitored any real and direct threat in the national capital region, but we are not complacent,  national police chief ronald dela rosa told reporters after reviewing security preparations on sunday.  there could be threats but we are ready and we are up to the challenge.  police will deploy 400 mobile patrol cars, 200 motorcyles, 22 armored vehicles and 100 bomb sniffing dogs to ensure the security and safety of leaders, officials and delegates to the biggest regional summit in manila this year.     some areas will be completely locked down, such as where heads of state and governments will hold meetings. main roads running from the former u.s. air force base about 90 kms north of manila to the venues will be partly closed. interior undersecretary catalino cuy said there was no plan to jam mobile phone signals to prevent potential crude bomb attacks because this would cause inconvenience for state officials and security personnel.

" donald trump’s supreme court nominee could help decide the fate of his moves to undo climate related u.s. regulations, but legal experts said neil gorsuch’s judicial record makes it hard to predict whether as a justice he would back a sweeping rollback. if confirmed to the lifetime job by the senate, the colorado based federal appeals court judge would restore the court’s 5 4 conservative majority. the senate is planning an april 7 confirmation vote although many democrats are fighting to block gorsuch. on the court, gorsuch could become a pivotal vote on the republican president’s deregulation agenda, along with fellow conservative anthony kennedy, who sometimes joins the court’s four liberals in close cases. that agenda includes trump’s effort to kill democratic former president barack obama’s so called clean power plan, blocked by the high court last year, aimed at reducing climate warming carbon emissions from mainly coal fired power plants. trump on tuesday signed an executive order kicking off a lengthy review process that environmental groups and democratic governed u.s. states have promised to challenge in court. gorsuch’s views on issues related to climate change are unclear. his mother headed the u.s. environmental protection agency under republican former president ronald reagan for two years in the 1980s. gorsuch was not asked about climate issues during his senate judiciary committee confirmation hearing last week. in his 11 years as a judge, the only major ruling touching upon climate policy came in 2015 when he was on a three judge panel that upheld a colorado measure requiring power generators to ensure a fifth of their electricity came from renewable sources. a 2016 case on federal agency power is potentially more instructive on how he might approach broad moves to slash current regulation, according to experts. in that case, gorsuch questioned a 1984 supreme court precedent giving federal agencies broad deference to interpret laws. gorsuch called the doctrine, enshrined in the chevron v. natural resource defense council ruling, an “elephant in the room” that concentrates federal power “in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution.” questions remain over how that approach would manifest itself if applied to efforts by trump’s epa to weaken or rescind existing agency regulations on fighting climate change. some environmental lawyers say it could mean gorsuch would be skeptical of any big changes at the agency level. the epa under obama compiled detailed scientific data to support its efforts to curb carbon emissions. “that could hamper the trump administration,” said jonathan adler, a conservative law professor at case western reserve university school of law in cleveland. sean donahue, a lawyer who represents environmental groups, agreed, saying if the epa were to “advance fancy interpretive footwork to try to make greenhouse gases not a clean air act pollutant,” the administration may not get the deference it wants. the extent to which the u.s. clean air act, the law that tackles air pollution, applies to carbon emissions is heavily contested in the courts. the supreme court, in the landmark 2007 decision massachusetts v. epa, held that carbon is a pollutant that could be subject to regulation under the law. in a 2014 case, the court largely upheld the obama administration’s first batch of greenhouse gas regulations. environmental groups including the sierra club have said they are ready to pounce if they see signs that trump’s epa, headed by fossil fuels industry ally scott pruitt, is ignoring science in making climate related regulatory changes. “i think the bottom line is that we hope any anti regulatory rule making should be so unscientific ... almost any federal judge should see through the trump administration maneuvering,” said pat gallagher, a sierra club lawyer.

" u.s. president donald trump on tuesday called on the pharmaceutical industry to boost u.s. production and lower prices, while also vowing to speed up approval times for new medicines and appoint a new u.s. food and drug administration leader soon.  shares of five of the six drug companies at the white house meeting with trump were up more than 1 percent on average following the president’s remarks, compared with a 0.5 percent drop in the broad s&p 500. the nasdaq biotech index was up 1.1 percent, reversing earlier losses, and the s&p 500 health care index gained 0.7 percent.      attending the meeting were the ceos of novartis ag, merck & co inc, johnson & johnson, celgene corp, eli lilly & co and amgen inc as well as the head of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america lobbying group. trump told the drugmakers that pricing had been “astronomical.” “we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. we have no choice, for medicare and medicaid,” trump said at the meeting, citing the nation’s government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled that together are the largest u.s. purchaser of medications.    trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers’ outsourcing their production and called on the companies to make more of their products in the united states.  he added that foreign countries must pay fair share for drug development costs.  “we’re going to end global freeloading,” trump said.  novartis  ceo joe jimenez, who is chairman elect of the industry lobbying group, said last week that he wanted to talk to trump about efforts to develop pricing models that would pay for clinical results rather than a flat price per pill, as well as plans to replace the affordable care act, which is popularly known as “obamacare.” trump spooked investors in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sectors by saying on jan. 11, before his inauguration, that drug companies were “getting away with murder” on what they charged the government for medicine and that he would do something about it.  that prompted the pharmaceutical lobbying group to unveil a new tv marketing campaign last week to improve its image by focusing attention on strides in research. company executives, meanwhile, have tried to tread a careful line in defending their industry while expressing optimism that the united states would continue to reward scientific advances.

" washington governor jay inslee on tuesday signed a bill that paves the way for the state to create what is believed to be the first system in the united states to certify marijuana as organic. the sponsor of the bill, republican senator ann rivers, said marijuana certified as organically grown is likely to be on sale in washington in about a year and a half. washington is among a handful of u.s. states where voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana. washington was the second state to begin legal recreational pot sales, in mid 2014, after its voters in 2012 approved it. “this is consumer driven,” rivers told reuters by phone on tuesday night. “as we have moved forward in the legal marijuana market, we’re hearing people say, ‘we don’t want any pesticides, fungicides, none of that stuff in our weed.’” the new law “creates a voluntary program for the certification and regulation of organic marijuana products,” to be administered by the washington agriculture department, according to a state analysis of the new law. rivers said the “heavy lifting” in certifying marijuana has been done by the system of doing the same for a multitude of food products on supermarkets shelves across america. that process just needs to be adapted for pot, she said. rivers said that legal recreational marijuana is “the gift that keeps on giving....this year, we’ll make $768 million” in revenue for the state of washington. this pays for drug education and drug addiction treatment as well as public education, she said. organic pot was just one of a myriad of marijuana related measures in the bill. many state legislators wanted to vote for only one marijuana related bill rather than have to go on the record favoring marijuana several times, rivers said. the november 2012 measure to allow recreational marijuana in washington passed 56 percent to 44 percent. while it is legal for adults to smoke marijuana in washington, it is not legal to grow industrial hemp. the new law allows for the study of a method to allow hemp to be grown and used for industrial purposes. last week, vermont’s legislature approved a bill to legalize recreational use of marijuana. unless the measure is vetoed, vermont would be the first state to legalize pot without a public vote. voters have approved legal recreational marijuana use in colorado, washington, alaska, oregon, california, nevada, maine, massachusetts and the district of columbia.

" lithuania s government lost its majority in parliament on saturday after its junior coalition partner quit, saying they has been sidelined over policies ranging from alcohol age limits to subsidies on central heating. a parliament vote on next year s budget, expected by early december, will be the first test for the minority government following the departure of the social democrats after less than a year in power. the government will need to convince opposition parties to support it on a case by case basis. the lithuanian farmers and greens union, the sole party remaining in power, have a block of 57 members in lithuania s 141 seat parliament. the country, once ruled from moscow but now a member of both the european union and nato, is rebuilding its military in the face of an assertive russia but has found development hampered by emigration and raising wages, eating away at competitiveness.  all preconditions are in place for our government to continue until the next general election in 2020,  saulius skvernelis, prime minister since november 2016, told reuters.  the social democrats took a short sighted and suicidal decision,  he added. lithuania s foreign minister linas linkevicius, a social democrat, told reuters he will leave his party to continue in the government. at least one of the two other social democrat appointees will leave the 15 member government, said social democrat chairman gintautas paluckas, elected in april this year on a reform mandate.  relationships within the coalition were bad, our opinions differed on almost all major issues and, since farmers and greens looked for votes elsewhere, we had scant possibilities to shape its politics,  he told reuters.  this will cost us influence in the short term, but we ll be in a position to better represent our supporters in the long term,  he said. the social democrats, which have held power for long stretches since lithuanian independence, have been looking for a way to reconnect with the voters after finishing a distant third in the 2016 general election. social democrat rank and file overwhelmingly supported leaving the government in a recent poll, in contrast to the party s members of parliament who preferred staying in power.

" saudi arabia s public investment fund (pif) is forming two real estate development firms to boost the capacity of mecca and medina to receive pilgrims, in projects expected to create billions of dollars of business, it said on monday. the plans are part of an array of commitments which the pif, the country s main sovereign wealth fund, is taking on under economic reforms designed to reduce saudi arabia s dependence on oil exports. the government is mobilising the fund, believed to have about $180 billion of assets, to lead urban development and industrial projects around the country, even as the pif manages stakes in top saudi companies and makes foreign investments such as last year s purchase of a $3.5 billion stake in uber. the scope of the pif s activities has caused concern among some private saudi businessmen. the reforms aim to stimulate the private sector but with so many huge projects going to the pif, some businessmen fear they could be crowded out by the deep pocketed fund. the pif said the first phase of its development of an area near the grand mosque in mecca would cover 854,000 square metres (9.1 million square feet) and deliver 115 buildings. it is to include 70,000 new hotel rooms and 9,000 housing units. construction will start this year with the first phase expected to open in 2024. by 2030, the area will contribute $2.1 billion annually to gross domestic product, the fund said. it also plans to develop 1.3 million square metres near the prophet s mosque in medina, adding 500 housing units and 80,000 hotel rooms. expanding islamic tourism is a top goal of saudi reforms, which seek to develop non oil income to offset a plunge in oil export receipts due to low crude prices. the pif did not reveal how much money it would invest, how it would award contracts, or the extent to which private investors would be brought in. riyadh has said it wants to involve private capital in major projects to reduce pressure on state finances, but in many cases a legal framework for such ventures has not yet been created. most saudi real estate developers are small, so state bodies often have to be used to jump start large projects, especially when the government wants to move quickly. among other pif projects, the fund said last week that it would lead the $4.8 billion redevelopment of jeddah s waterfront corniche. [nl8n1m83kv] in august, the government said it would develop resorts on about 50 red sea islands in a pif backed project. the fund will be the main investor in a 334 square kilometre (129 square mile)  entertainment city  near riyadh featuring cultural and recreational facilities.

" democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders is in “overall very good health,” with no limitations on his work as a u.s. senator, his physician said in a letter released on thursday. the letter from brian monahan, the attending physician for congress, detailed the health of the vermont senator, who is vying with hillary clinton for his party’s nomination to the november 2016 presidential election. “you are in overall very good health and active in your professional work, and recreational lifestyle without limitation,” said the jan. 20 letter posted on sanders’ campaign website. presidential candidates often release such statements to assure voters that they are fit for the presidency. the race between clinton and sanders, 74, has tightened in recent weeks, and polls show the two in a statistical dead heat for the iowa caucus on feb. 1. the letter notes that sanders has, over the years, been treated for conditions ranging from gout to hypothyroidism to diverticulitis. he has also had surgery to repair hernias and excise a vocal cord cyst, the letter said. the senator also takes levothyroxine daily and indomethacin occasionally, it added. levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, and indomethacin is used treat stiffness and pain from osteoarthritis, according to the u.s. national library of medicine. sanders’ main democratic rival, hillary clinton, released a statement from her own doctor last year giving her a clean bill of health.

" the u.n. human rights council voted on friday to extend its investigation into suspected crimes against humanity in burundi, dealing a blow to an attempt by a group of african countries to dial down the level of scrutiny.  burundi had hoped that by promising to cooperate fully with the u.n. human rights office and inviting three experts to the country, the council would drop its commission of inquiry. it appeared to have succeeded on thursday when the council agreed to send the three experts, backing a resolution that also welcomed burundi s decision  to restore full cooperation  with the high commissioner for human rights.  burundi s ambassador, renovat tabu, told the council that after that decision, there was no longer any need to continue the commission of inquiry, as demanded by the european union.  there is a clear will of the eu to instrumentalize the council to politicize human rights,  he said. but the eu, with strong backing from the united states, pressed the case for the commission of inquiry.   just days ago, when burundi finally agreed to engage members of this council in discussions for the first time, the burundian ambassador portrayed a rosy picture of his country, with the clear goal of ending the commission of inquiry, which he repeated again today,  u.s. diplomat jason mack said.   don t be confused by burundi s last minute engagement, which is solely to put an end to ongoing investigations,  he said.  the commission has said there are reasonable grounds to believe crimes against humanity have been committed since april 2015 when president pierre nkurunziza said he would seek a third term in office. the opposition has said he acted unconstitutionally by doing so.  burundian officials at the highest level  should be held accountable for crimes against humanity and a list of suspects has been drawn up, the commission said earlier this month. in a statement following the vote, the commission said it   would like to believe that the burundian authorities will now respond to a renewed request for dialogue . among the 22 countries voting to maintain maximum scrutiny were botswana and burundi s neighbor rwanda, alongside european countries and the united states. other african nations were among the 11  no  votes and 14 abstentions.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump, who has called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states, suggested he would make an exception for london’s newly elected muslim mayor, the new york times reported. however, sadiq khan who was sworn in as mayor of the british capital on saturday, dismissed trump’s response, saying the real estate billionaire and presumptive republican nominee had an “ignorant view of islam”. “there will always be exceptions,” the times on monday quoted trump as saying when asked how his controversial proposal would apply to khan, the son of a pakistani immigrant bus driver and a seamstress. trump said he was happy to see khan elected, the times reported, adding: “you lead by example, always lead by example. if he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing.” trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by islamist militants in paris and california last year. muslim and human rights groups, trump’s democratic rivals and many of his republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counter productive and contrary to american values. khan said trump’s view risked alienating mainstream muslims and played into the hands of extremists, making both britain and the united states less secure. “this isn’t just about me   it’s about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world,” he said in a statement on tuesday. “donald trump and those around him think that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream islam   london has proved him wrong.” khan, 45, a candidate from the opposition labour party, defeated his conservative rival by a record margin last week to secure the biggest individual mandate in british political history after an acrimonious campaign. after his victory, he accused his opponents of using fear and innuendo about his alleged links to extremists to turn ethnic and religious groups against each other, which he described as “something straight out of the donald trump playbook”. in an interview with time magazine, khan said he wanted to go to the united states to see the interesting programmes the mayors of new york and chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before january in case trump won the nov. 8 election.

" u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday the united states is prepared to tackle the crisis surrounding north korea without china if necessary. the president made the comments at a joint news conference with visiting nato secretary general jens stoltenberg. trump met chinese president xi jinping last week and spoke to him by phone on wednesday night. “president xi wants to do the right thing. we had a very good bonding, i think we had a very good chemistry together,  i think he wants to help us with north korea,” trump said. “we talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and i said the way you’re going to make a good trade deal is to help us with north korea, otherwise we’re just going to go it alone, that’ll be all right too, but going it alone means going with lots of other nations.” ",0
" new zealand s new government plans to review and reform the central bank act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target, labour prime minister elect jacinda ardern said on tuesday. the populist new zealand first, the junior partner in the new labour led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank s focus to include greater management of the local dollar s value against other currencies.  we have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the reserve bank act,  ardern told reporters in wellington.  the objectives of the act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.  labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. new zealand first has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.  the new zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on tuesday as ardern and new zealand first leader winston peters confirmed their policy priorities. the kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point. rather than just focussing on inflation, labour wants the reserve bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the united states and australia.  while unemployment in new zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election. the unlikely alliance between the centre left labour and populist new zealand first was brokered after a sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing national or opposition labour.  peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and ardern indicated on tuesday that peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of new zealand s international relations. peters was foreign minister in a labour led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of western politicians to visit north korea.   the general consensus is that he did a good job,  said richard shaw, politics professor at massey university.  he wasn t particularly interested in restructuring departments. he s very good at working the room and is an affable character.  labour and new zealand first share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage. many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in new zealand s formerly open door policy.  ardern said labour s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. this represents a less dramatic cut than new zealand first had proposed prior to the election. net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year. while a  confidence and supply  agreement with the greens is delivering policies across the political spectrum, such as a push to legalise cannabis for personal use.

" the federal reserve bank of new york will soon narrow its search for candidates to fill what is considered the fed’s second most powerful job after having scouted a diverse field, from a local business school dean to a former fed governor. new york fed president william dudley steps down in mid 2018 and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists, academics, investors, bankers and policymakers. “they are looking beyond the traditional mold” of an expert in banking, markets or monetary policy, and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days, said one person in contact with the directors.  the new york fed president is at the intersection of u.s. monetary policy and financial markets, and is responsible for the policing of wall street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world.  unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy, the new york fed boss is nominated by the regional bank’s board of directors rather than the white house and does not require congressional approval. dudley’s successor could play an even greater role guiding the fed through a historic leadership change in which u.s. president donald trump can fill six of the seven seats on the fed board of governors. he has so far named jerome powell and randal quarles   lawyers, not phd economists   to top positions in washington, with powell replacing chair janet yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term. both men support the republican push for wall street deregulation. yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the fed’s tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn.  by now the new york fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like, according to people familiar with the search. two of those people, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process, said search firms have contacted among several others peter blair henry, 48, dean of new york university’s stern school of business, and former fed governor kevin warsh.  warsh, 47, who was in the running for fed chair before trump picked powell last month, declined to be considered for the new york job, they said. one of these people said henry appeared to be the early front runner.  henry and a spokeswoman for warsh at stanford university’s hoover institution, where he is a visiting fellow, did not respond to requests for comment.  the permanent voting fed governors need a white house nod and senate approval. the other 11 district presidents vote every two or three years under a century old rotation meant to emphasize new york's unique role as a counterbalance to the washington based board. its president enjoys broad independence and also serves as vice chair of the central bank's rate setting committee. (for a graphic of the fed's ideological doves and hawks, see: goo.gl/5bptex) “it’s a critical position and more important than the fed’s vice chair from a market standpoint,” greg peters, senior investment officer at pgim fixed income, which oversees $695 billion in assets, told reuters.  still, the fed’s board of governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by new york’s four member search committee led by liberal leaning directors sara horowitz and glenn hutchins. horowitz, founder of the freelancers union which advocates for independent workers, chairs the new york fed’s board. hutchins is co founder of private equity firm silver lake partners and a noted public policy philanthropist.  several weeks before dudley’s resignation announcement in early november, the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background, but also race and gender, according to those familiar with the effort. the new york fed declined to comment. in a video posted on its website last month, the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from team building and sensitivity to local economic trends, to intellectual leadership and crisis management.  the initial search effort suggests the next new york fed chief could have a different background than dudley and his predecessors, who tended to be bankers or market economists with wall street or u.s. treasury experience, and who were all white and male.   dudley was chief economist at goldman sachs before joining the fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the no. 2 policymaker behind yellen.  at the time of his departure, the new york fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently $4.4 trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis, a task that would favor candidates with market experience.  jamaica born henry, who will step down as stern’s dean at year end, would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the fed’s upper ranks. a review of henry’s public papers and comments reveal little about his views on u.s. monetary policy or financial supervision, though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the new york fed’s role as foreign liaison. if chosen he would become the institution’s first black president. those who have spoken to new york fed directors said past and present insiders, as well as outsiders, were considered. among them were: simon potter, the head of the new york fed’s markets desk; brian sack, his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund d.e. shaw; and lorie logan, potter’s deputy.  they said the field also included lael brainard, one of four sitting fed governors; former fed governor and harvard professor jeremy stein; and mohamed el erian, the chief economic adviser at pimco parent allianz se. all of those named declined to comment. it was unclear how much formal contact if any they have had with the new york fed about the job. the bank has said the process should take six to nine months.

" republican senator rand paul on tuesday threatened to vote ‘no’ on a budget resolution republican leaders aim to bring up for a vote this week unless they decide to stick with spending caps, potentially putting the party’s tax cut plans at risk. “i have told the white house and (republican) leaders that if they simply stick to their own caps, the rest of the budget is fine and i’ll vote yes,” paul wrote on twitter. “it is a simple, but important, change they could easily make. the ball is in their court.” republican leaders can afford to lose only two republican votes on the budget plan, which would pave the way for large scale tax cuts, if democrats remain united in opposition. with senator thad cochran out of town for health reasons, a defection by paul would leave the vote on a razor’s edge.

" u.s. president elect donald trump said on thursday he would name retired marine corps general james mattis as defense secretary. the following is a list of republican trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration. all the posts but that of national security adviser require senate confirmation: mattis is a retired marine corps general known for his tough talk, distrust of iran and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan. a former leader of central command, which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and south asia, mattis, 66, is known by many u.s. forces by his nickname “mad dog.” he was once rebuked for saying in 2005: “it’s fun to shoot some people.” mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and hollywood financier who spent 17 years at goldman sachs before leaving in 2002. he assembled an investor group to buy a failed california mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as onewest bank and built it into southern california’s largest bank. the bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. ross, 78, heads the private equity firm w.l. ross & co. his net worth was pegged by forbes at about $2.9 billion. a staunch supporter of trump and an economic adviser, ross has helped shape the trump campaign’s views on trade policy. he blames the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico, which entered into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of china into the world trade organization for causing massive u.s. factory job losses. chao, 63, was labor secretary under president george w. bush for eight years and the first asian american woman to hold a cabinet position. chao is a director at ingersoll rand, news corp and vulcan materials company. she is married to u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a republican from kentucky. health and human services secretary: u.s. representative tom price price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the house of representatives’ budget committee. a representative from georgia since 2005, price has criticized obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. he is opposed to abortion. u.s. ambassador to the united nations: governor nikki haley haley, a 44 year old republican, has been governor of south carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. the daughter of indian immigrants, haley led a successful push last year to remove the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the south carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in charleston by a white gunman. devos, 58, is a billionaire republican donor, a former chair of the michigan republican party and an advocate for the privatization of education. as chair of the american federation for children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. [l1n1do0kc] sessions, 69, was the first u.s. senator to endorse trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. the son of a country store owner, the senator from alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  national security adviser: retired lieutenant general michael flynn flynn, 57, was an early supporter of trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. he began his u.s. army career in 1981 and served deployments in afghanistan and iraq. flynn became head of the defense intelligence agency in 2012 under president barack obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of obama’s foreign policy. pompeo, 52, is a third term congressman from kansas who serves on the house of representatives intelligence committee, which oversees the cia, national security agency and cyber security. a retired army officer and harvard law school graduate, pompeo supports the u.s. government’s sweeping collection of americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with iran.

" a former finance co chair of chris christie’s presidential campaign on sunday slammed christie’s recent endorsement of donald trump, according to nbc, calling for the new jersey governor’s supporters to reject the republican front runner.  “chris christie’s endorsement of donald trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. donald trump is unfit to be president,” meg whitman, chief executive officer of hewlett packard, said in a statement reported by nbc’s “meet the press” program. christie, appearing on abc’s “this week” program, responded by describing whitman “a great friend” with a different political opinion. “and that’s ok. that’s what makes this country great is that people can have differences of political opinion,” he said.   just days before the super tuesday nominating contests, christie on friday became the most prominent mainstream republican to get behind the billionaire republican front runner and former reality tv star, declaring trump to have the best chance of defeating democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. but whitman’s statement said the new jersey governor made his statement despite his own public misgivings about a trump presidency. “trump would take america on a dangerous journey. christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly,” whitman said. trump’s unorthodox candidacy has shaken the republican party and has drawn increasingly vehement criticism from his rivals. but a growing number of senior republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in november. christie, who withdrew his own white house bid earlier this month, denied that he reversed course on trump after promising new hampshire union leader newspaper publisher joe mcquaid that he would not endorse him after the billionaire won the state’s feb. 9 primary election. “it’s just not true. he called me two days after the primary and said, i was just told that you’re about to endorse donald trump. and i said to him, that’s absolutely untrue. i’m not about to endorse anybody,” christie told abc.

" the standoff over north korea could lead to  nuclear war , a japanese pro wrestler turned lawmaker warned on wednesday, urging nations to dial down the tension after the isolated country fired a missile over northern japan last month. tokyo could play a role in mediating with its neighbor, said the 74 year old antonio inoki, who is known for fighting boxer muhammad ali four decades ago.  we are seeing a situation where each raises his fist and the situation is escalating,  inoki, who recently returned from his 32nd visit to pyongyang, told a news conference, wearing his signature red scarf.  it s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce the tension,  said inoki, who, like u.s. basketball star dennis rodman, has made numerous visits to north korea. pyongyang must commit to denuclearization as a prerequisite for talks, japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in an interview with the nikkei business daily published on wednesday.  on monday, the u.n. security council voted to tighten sanctions on the north over its sixth nuclear test. during meetings with north korea s top diplomat ri su yong and others on his visit, inoki proposed that japan s ruling liberal democratic party send a delegation to pyongyang, perhaps as a first step toward a visit by abe, he added.  i did make the proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation,  said inoki, who strode into the news conference as if entering the ring, his theme song blaring. inoki said he sensed more ldp members were beginning to think dialogue was needed, but admitted the hurdle to an abe visit was high.  abe and other japanese officials have said now was the time for pressure, not dialogue. the square jawed, 1.9 metre  (6 foot three inch ) tall inoki developed close ties with north korea because his mentor, pro wrestling legend rikidozan, hailed from north korea but could never go home. first elected to parliament s upper house in 1989 from his  sports and peace party , inoki made headlines the next year when he went to iraq during the gulf war and intervened on behalf of japanese hostages, who were subsequently released. inoki was elected again in 2013 as an independent. like rodman, he says it is vital to maintain lines of communication with the isolated north.   it s important to keep the door open,  inoki said.

" a former california lawmaker was sentenced to six months in prison and six months in home confinement monday for laundering a bribe accepted by his brother, also a former legislator. thomas calderon, 62, pleaded guilty on june 6 to one count of money laundering in the case. he admitted to depositing $30,000 in an account held by his political consulting company, the calderon group, that had been offered as a bribe by an undercover agent to his brother in 2013, the u.s. department of justice said monday. “tom calderon was all too aware of the bribe payments to his brother and that his brother had agreed to a quid pro quo with the undercover agents,” united states attorney eileen m. decker said in a press release. “tom calderon facilitated these bribe payments by helping to conceal his brother’s corrupt activities from the public.” calderon’s attorney, shepard kopp, said the longtime political hand from the blue collar los angeles suburb of montebello was deeply remorseful for his actions. “if he had it to do all over again he would obviously make a different decision,” kopp said. “but it’s important to view tom and his life and public service as a whole rather than this one episode. he’s been trying to better the lives of the people in his community on the east side of los angeles for more than 30 years.” he was sentenced monday by u.s. district court judge christina snyder to a year and a day in custody   half of it in federal prison   and 100 hours of community service. calderon, a democrat, served in the state assembly from 1998 to 2002, representing montebello and other suburbs northeast of los angeles.  his brother, ronald calderon, 59, also of montebello, was a democratic state senator in 2013, when the fbi raided his office as part of the corruption case. the brothers were indicted in the case the following year. ron calderon, who took a leave of absence from the state senate until his term ended in 2014,  pleaded guilty to mail fraud in the case and is set to be sentenced next week.

" as fellow republicans labored to repeal obamacare this week, u.s. president donald trump repeatedly swerved off topic, escalating concerns in his party about his ability to govern the country six months after taking office. while senators grappled with healthcare, trump banned transgender people from the military. he regaled a boy scout jamboree with a tale from a new york cocktail party. he indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director. in the end, the senate’s efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on friday, magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around trump, the constant storm of tweets, the white house infighting, the self inflicted wounds. “we’re seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments,” said republican strategist alice stewart, a top aide to senator ted cruz’s presidential campaign last year. in the latest twist, trump late on friday named u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly as his new white house chief of staff, replacing reince priebus, who has been in a feud with trump’s new communications director anthony scaramucci. among some establishment republicans, there were signs that patience with trump was wearing thin. his national security team, seen as a bedrock of normality, increasingly is frustrated. national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and secretary of state rex tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the white house. defense secretary james mattis was coming to grips with trump’s abrupt decision on wednesday, via a tweet, to ban transgender individuals from military service. the pentagon  said it would not execute the order without more guidance. republican strategist charlie black said trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between russia and his 2016 campaign run its course and not keep talking about it. russia denies meddling, and trump denies any collusion. the russia probe has fed public spats with attorney general jeff sessions, quarreling among aides and attacks on robert mueller, the special counsel running the investigation. “he should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while,” black said. “there are still some good things that could get done in congress like tax reform. he can help further those things if that’s what he talks about.” in the senate healthcare fight, trump phoned republican senators and urged them to support repeal of obamacare, but the effort fizzled, a sign there was little political retribution to fear from a president with a sub 40 percent approval rating. a moderate house republican said trump let down the obamacare rollback effort by not going out and selling a plan. for trump, a businessman and former reality tv show host, the presidency is his first elected office. “this issue was outsourced to congress. it was never really sold. i think that was part of the reason why it was a failure,” said republican representative charlie dent. as the senate fight was coming to a head, washington was suddenly mesmerized by a profanity laced rant from scaramucci, who tore into priebus and trump strategist steve bannon in an interview in the new yorker magazine. stunned aides stopped what they were doing to read the article online. the rant has so far gone unpunished. inside the white house, there was a sense of genuine concern and bewilderment about what scaramucci’s future might portend. former white house press secretary ari fleischer said the tensions did not seem to trouble trump. “the president’s management style seems to be to encourage factionalism among people below him. he seems to place value on watching people fight,” fleischer said. aside from sacking priebus, it was unclear how trump planned to proceed to regain his footing. with healthcare stalled, trump has his sights set on tax reform with no consensus on how to proceed. top aides are split on how deeply to cut taxes. it is the same moderates versus conservatives split that doomed the obamacare rollback.

" the u.s. supreme court on wednesday ruled that basic elements in cheerleader uniform designs merit copyright protection, handing a victory to the top american maker of the garments in a decision with serious implications for the fashion industry.     the justices ruled 6 2 to uphold a lower court’s 2015 ruling allowing a lawsuit by varsity brands inc [leogrv.ul], the dominant cheerleader uniform maker, accusing smaller rival star athletica llc of infringing on five of its designs to proceed. in the majority opinion written by justice clarence thomas and joined by chief justice john roberts and justices samuel alito, elena kagan, and sonia sotomayor, the high court put forth a two part test for whether design elements warranted copyright protection. the justices said the “pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features” must be “separable” from the design of a utilitarian object. the features would also have to merit copyright protection as a stand alone work. justice ruth bader ginsburg concurred in the majority decisions but said she would not have applied a “separability” test. justices stephen breyer and anthony kennedy dissented, saying the elements could not be separated from the design. the closely watched case centered on whether the stripes, zigzags and chevrons that typify cheerleader uniforms can be copyrighted, as varsity contends, or are so fundamental to the purpose of the garment that they should not deserve such legal protection. without such adornments, a cheerleader uniform might look like the commonplace “little black dress,” star athletica argued.

" the last time white zimbabwean farmer rob smart left his land it was at gunpoint, forced out in june by riot police armed with tear gas and ak 47 assault rifles. he returned on thursday to ululations and tears of joy from  former workers and their families who were also kicked out   a jubilant return and the first sign that the president who has replaced robert mugabe is making good on a vow to stop illegal land seizures and restore property rights. scores of jubilant black zimbabweans nearly knocked the 71 year old off his feet as he and his two children stepped out of their car and onto their land for the first time in six months. smart s case was taken up by emmerson mnangagwa, zimbabwe s then vice president who heard of smart s violent eviction while at an investment conference in johannesburg.  mnangagwa became president last month following a de facto coup that ended 93 year old mugabe s rule. in the latter half of his 37 years in power, zimbabwe s economy collapsed, especially after the seizure of thousands of white owned commercial farms under the banner of post colonial land reform.  land ownership is one of zimbabwe s most sensitive political topics. colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless. twenty years later, mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white owned farms and justified it on the grounds that it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era. white farmers complained that well connected people used state security forces to force them off their farms, sometimes in the middle of harvesting, even after the mugabe government indicated, some four years ago, that land seizures were over.  we are overjoyed, over the moon. we thought we would never see this day coming,  smart s son, darryn, told reuters.  getting back to the farm has given not just us, but the whole community hope that it s a new zimbabwe, a new country.  rob smart, whose father said he started the farm from  virgin bush  in 1932, expressed confidence in the new government s pledge to protect the commercial farming sector, a mainstay of the struggling economy.  it s early days but so far what they (the new government) said they are going to do they are doing,  he told reuters.  we just hope this whole incident will give hope to other farmers, who ve had the same situation.  mnangagwa, who is under pressure to revive the economy ahead of elections next year, said on thursday that he was resolute about the changes he was introducing.   there is no business as usual. things have changed, it s a new era,  he said at a meeting with business leaders in south africa.   i m from the military. if it s  left turn  then it s  left turn . if it s  right turn  it s  right turn . no confusion.  mnangagwa s new agriculture minister, perrance shiri, last week ordered illegal occupiers of farms to vacate the land immediately, a move that could ultimately see some white farmers who say they were unfairly evicted return to farming. shiri, a military hardliner who was head of the air force before being picked for the crucial ministry this month, called for  unquestionable sanity on the farms . for 83 year old anna matemani, whose late husband worked on the farm, smart s return was long overdue.   i m so happy he is finally back. he always helped us and the farm provides jobs for many of our young people,  said the grandmother of 15, who grew up and raised her children on the farm and witnessed rob s birth, wiping away tears.  some of the smarts  joy subsided as they walked into their ransacked farmhouses.  the occupiers had looted property, including clothes, the children s toys, three guns, bottles of 100 year old wine and smart s late father roy s medals from when he served with the police reserve air wing in the former rhodesia.  i m sad about my grandfather s medals,  darryn smart said, surveying a ransacked room.  you can buy tables and chairs, you can t buy that family history. but thank goodness we re here.

" two republican u.s. presidential hopefuls said on saturday they would implement quarantines of travelers if necessary to stop the spread of the zika virus. new jersey governor chris christie, who garnered international attention in 2014 when he quarantined a nurse who returned to the united states after treating ebola patients, said he would not hesitate to do it again.  “you bet i would,” christie said during a debate in new hampshire with other republican contenders for the white house. ben carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said using a quarantine is “not a simple issue” but if there was evidence that zika infection is spreading, he too would utilize a quarantine. the zika virus is carried by mosquitoes, which transmit it  to humans. two suspected cases of sexual transmission in the united states also raise questions about other ways that zika may spread. the virus is affecting large parts of latin american and the caribbean. the world health organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on feb. 1, citing a “strongly suspected” relationship between zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly   a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.

" ukraine s petro poroshenko met u.s. president donald trump on thursday and said afterwards that they had a shared vision on a  new level  of defense cooperation, but not whether this included the u.s. provision of defensive weapons to ukraine. the united states is reviewing whether to send weapons to ukraine to help it defend itself, an option that previous u.s. president barack obama vetoed and which is opposed by russia. after meeting trump in new york, president poroshenko told a televised briefing:  it s very important that there is a shared vision on a new level of cooperation in the defense sphere.   we discussed all areas of this cooperation, including cooperation with the defense ministry and other institutions,  he added, without saying whether there had been any progress on the defensive weapons initiative. the two leaders skirted around the topic of russia when they spoke to reporters at the beginning of their private meeting. instead, they chose to emphasize economic cooperation when they appeared before reporters at their meeting on the fringes of the u.n. general assembly. relations between kiev and moscow are at their lowest ebb since russia annexed crimea more than three years ago and russian backed separatist fighters took up arms against ukrainian government forces in the east of the country. before holding private talks, trump praised poroshenko, telling him that  i wouldn t say it s (ukraine) the easiest place to live  but  it s getting better and better on a daily basis.  speaking in english, poroshenko said he believed that the two countries had improved security and economic cooperation with many u.s. companies doing business in ukraine.  that s a story that s pretty untold,  said trump.  companies are going very strongly right now into the ukraine, they see a tremendous potential there.  it was not immediately clear if they spoke privately about relations with russian president vladimir putin, who did not attend the u.n. general assembly. the war in eastern ukraine between pro russian separatists and ukrainian government forces has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which russia denies.  poroshenko said trump had supported ukraine s proposal to deploy u.n peacekeepers  including on the uncontrolled part of the ukraine russia border, which would prevent the possibility of penetration by russian troops or russian weapons . putin this month also suggested u.n. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern ukraine. but russia has balked at ukraine s proposal that would ban any russian nationals from taking part in the peacekeeping mission which kiev wants deployed along the part of its border with russia it does not control. poroshenko said the meeting with trump lasted an hour and was also attended by u.s. vice president mike pence, secretary of state rex tillerson and other senior u.s. officials.

" annual employee surveys released by the fbi on wednesday show former director james comey was highly regarded, contradicting president donald trump’s claim when he fired comey this year that he had lost the confidence of the agency’s workers. the voluntary survey conducted in 2017 showed comey received top marks on all but two of more than 90 questions. he scored high marks for expressing a compelling vision for the federal bureau of investigation and helping morale, with respondents strongly agreeing that they would choose to work with him again. the findings contradict statements made by trump and white house officials at the time of comey’s firing on may 9. trump insisted he fired comey because of job performance and told a news conference the fbi chief “was very unpopular with most people.” trump portrayed the fbi under comey as being a mess. comey told a senate panel that white house claims the fbi was in disarray and poorly led were “lies, plain and simple.” other senior fbi officials praised comey and said they were proud to have worked with him, but the workplace surveys were the first broad measure of employee sentiment toward him. trump’s reasons for firing comey shifted over time, and he told one interviewer the investigation into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election was on his mind when he made the decision. comey told lawmakers he thought he was fired because of the russia investigation. his firing is now part of special counsel robert mueller’s probe into ties between russian officials and trump’s political campaign.

" the u.s. office of special counsel is investigating whether interior secretary ryan zinke broke the law when he gave a speech to a professional hockey team owned by a political donor in june, the agency said on tuesday. zinke is already being investigated by the interior department’s inspector general in connection with his travels and the use of private charter flights, amid heightened scrutiny into private plane use by administration officials. the campaign for accountability complained last week that a speech zinke gave on june 26 to the vegas golden knights, a national hockey league team based in las vegas, violated the hatch act barring executive branch employees from engaging in political activity.  the team is owned by bill foley, chairman of fidelity national financial inc and a donor to zinke’s congressional campaigns.  the office of special counsel’s hatch act unit, which is independent from the justice department, said in an email to daniel stevens, executive director of the campaign for accountability, that it received its hatch act complaint “and will open a case file to address this matter.”     a spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the case. interior department officials said the speech did not violate any laws, rules or regulations. melinda loftin, the interior department’s designated ethics official and edward keable, director of interior’s departmental ethics office, said in a joint statement that zinke’s use of chartered flights and engagements were cleared by ethics and legal departments.  “the trip   including the secretary’s address to the hockey developmental squad   was completely compliant with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,” they said. on friday, former health and human services secretary tom price resigned after an outcry over his use of costly private charter planes for government business.  the campaign for accountability questioned zinke’s travel. “contrary to the conclusion drawn by interior officials, a trip to offer a motivational speech to a hockey team does not appear to fall within the mission of the department of interior   ‘protecting america’s great outdoors and powering our future,’” the watchdog group wrote. in june, the office of special counsel determined that trump’s social media director dan scavino violated the hatch act in april in calling for trump supporters to defeat a republican congressman at the polls.

" republican u.s. lawmakers expect to unveil this week the text of long awaited legislation to repeal and replace the obamacare healthcare law, one of president donald trump’s top legislative priorities, a senior republican congressional aide said on sunday. since taking office in january, trump has pressed his fellow republicans who control congress to act quickly to dismantle former democratic president barack obama’s affordable care act and pass a plan to replace it, but lawmakers in the party have differed on the specifics. democrats have warned that republicans risk throwing the entire u.s. healthcare system into chaos by repealing the 2010 law that was passed by congressional democrats over united republican opposition. republicans condemn it as a government overreach, and trump has called it a “disaster.”  the aide cited progress in meetings and phone calls starting on friday and lasting through the weekend involving house of representatives speaker paul ryan, health and human services secretary tom price, white house budget chief mick mulvaney, trump domestic policy adviser andrew bremberg and others. “we are in a very good place right now, and while drafting continues, we anticipate the release of final bill text early this week,” said the aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. the aide called the expected bill a “consensus republican plan,” but offered no details. ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for ryan, said: “we are now at the culmination of a years long process to keep our promise to the american people.” the obamacare law has proven popular in many states, even some controlled by republicans, and it enabled about 20 million previously uninsured people to get medical insurance, although premium increases angered some.

" a tax plan by u.s. senate republicans released on thursday diverges in several ways from legislation being pushed by republicans in the house of representatives, complicating republican efforts to fulfill their goal of overhauling the tax code by the end of the year. here are the major provisions that differ significantly. corporate rate: the house plan would immediately cut the  corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. the senate would set the same rate, but delay it by one year. carried interest: the senate leaves unchanged a loophole that allows private equity fund managers and other wealthy wall street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the higher income tax rate on their “carried interest” income. the house version narrows the loophole by requiring investments to be held for more than three years instead of one year currently in order to qualify for capital gains treatment. net operating losses: the senate version eliminates the carry back and carry forward tax strategies by businesses to reduce past and future tax liabilities using net operating losses. the house version tightens the rules around their use. pass throughs: the house caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the current top rate on “pass through” income of up to 39.6 percent. the senate version has no special pass through rate but allows business owners to deduct about 17.4 percent of business income from individual taxes. that translates to a 30 percent tax rate for high income filers. repatriation of overseas earnings: the senate imposes a tax of 12 percent for liquid assets and 5 percent for illiquid. the house sets the rates at 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively. tax brackets: the senate version maintains seven tax brackets, with the top bracket’s rate at 38.5 percent. the house has four brackets with the top one unchanged from current levels at 39.6 percent and lifts qualifying income on that top rate to more than $1 million. mortgage interest deduction: the house caps the deduction of interest payments on mortgages of up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. the senate version keeps the existing limit at $1 million but eliminates the deduction of interest on home equity loans.   deducting state and local taxes: the senate bill repeals the state and local tax deduction entirely. the house version repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales tax and caps the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  standard deduction: the two versions are in line with each other, with a standard deduction of $12,200 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, nearly double the current  levels. child tax credit: the senate would expand the child tax credit to $1,650 from $1,000. the house version sets it at  $1,600.  inheritances: while the house wants to double the exemption on inherited assets and repeal the tax over a period of six years, the senate only wants to double the exemption.

" the united states and the european union warned china on wednesday that it should respect an international court ruling expected later this year on its dispute with the philippines over territory in the south china sea. china claims virtually all the south china sea and rejects the authority of the permanent court of arbitration in the hague hearing the dispute, even though beijing has ratified the u.n. convention on the law of the sea on which the case is based. amy searight, u.s. deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia, said the united states, the european union, and allies like australia, japan and south korea must be ready to make clear that the court’s ruling must be binding and that there would be costs to china for not respecting it if it lost the case. “we need to be ready to be very loud and vocal, in harmony together, standing behind the philippines and the rest of the asean claimants to say that this is international law, this is incredibly important, it is binding on all parties,” she told a seminar at washington’s center for strategic and international studies. searight said the message to china, if it did not respect a negative ruling, should be, “we will hold you accountable.” “certainly, reputational cost is at stake, but we can think  of other creative ways to perhaps impose costs as well,” she said without elaborating. the hague tribunal has no powers of enforcement and its rulings have been ignored before. manila has said the court may hand down a ruling before may. china disputes south china sea territory with several other members of the association of southeast asian nations (asean) as well as the philippines. klaus botzet, head of the political section of the eu delegation in washington, said it was difficult to oppose world opinion. “a joint western, a joint world opinion, matters also for beijing,” he said. “if we unanimously support that international law as formulated by the international tribunal in the hague ... needs to be upheld, that’s a very strong message and will be very difficult to ignore,” he said. chinese foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said he had “noted” the comments, and repeated china’s opposition to the arbitration case and refusal to participate. the philippines’ “scheme would never succeed”, he told a daily news briefing in beijing. in unusually forthright language, botzet said china’s policy of military buildup was not in its interest. “it’s investing much more in its military relative to its economic growth; it’s forcing its neighbors into alliances  against itself; positions its neighbors otherwise wouldn’t take and the return on investment on this policy is negative,” he said. the united states had exceptional military capabilities in the asia pacific, botzet said, adding that the european union “strongly supports the american guarantee of international law in asia.” ",0
" france, home of the 2015 paris climate change accord, will redouble its efforts to limit carbon emissions and pull other signatory countries along with it, environment minister nicolas hulot said on friday. hulot was speaking hours after u.s. president donald trump confirmed his plan to pull the world’s second biggest carbon emitter out of the deal on the basis that it was bad for the american economy and would weaken its sovereignty. “it’s not dead. on the contrary france itself, rather than reduce its ambitions, will revise them upwards and we will pull along in our wake a number of other states,” hulot said on europe 1 radio. “france intends to maintain and reinforce its diplomatic leadership on this subject.” hulot is a well known french environmentalist who was pulled into the new government of president emmanuel macron as a minister when it was formed less than three weeks ago. joining a stream of international criticism of the move, he  said talks would immediately get under way about a riposte, including with india, whose prime minister narendra modi visits france this weekend. late on thursday, italian prime minister paolo gentiloni, german chancellor angela merkel and macron urged their allies to speed up efforts to combat climate change and said they would do more to help developing countries adapt.  macron himself went on television on thursday night to condemn trump’s move. speaking in a separate address in english,  he invited u.s. scientists and climate change researchers to come to france, and stole a trump catch phrase to say it was time to “make the planet great again”. french prime minister edouard philippe called trump’s decision “calamitous”. “the gravity of this subject is well documented, and everyone knows the considerable efforts we have to deliver to be up to this major challenge, yet the president of the united states consciously decides to pull out,” he said on rtl radio. “it’s calamitous for the planet.” ",0
" canadian and u.s. officials are working on a plan to tackle asylum seekers crossing into canada illegally, with american officials keen to discover how they entered the united states in the first place, said a source familiar with the matter. u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly is set to visit canada this month for talks on the border and the influx of people, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. hundreds of people, mainly from africa but also the middle east, have walked across the border, seeking asylum. they are fleeing president donald trump’s crackdown on illegal immigrants, migrants and refugees agencies say. it is not common to have so many asylum seekers based in the u.s. looking for refuge in canada over such a short period. scott bardsley, a spokesman for public safety minister ralph goodale, said the majority of people crossing in recent weeks held valid passports and u.s. visas. the influx poses a political risk for prime minister justin trudeau, who faces pressure from the left, which wants him to let more in, and from the right, which fears an increased security risk. he must also ensure the issue does not complicate his relations with trump.  “we are talking with our counterparts in the united states to ensure that we’re addressing this situation properly,” trudeau told reporters in calgary, alberta. security experts have said the asylum seekers could pose a threat if the flow picks up once the weather improves and authorities do not take additional steps. canadian and u.s. officials speak daily about the border crossers and law enforcement agencies from both nations met in montreal last month to plot strategies, the source said. the u.s. side asked canada to provide details of the asylum seekers, in particular, how they had entered the united states and what their status was there.  the montreal summit grouped representatives from the royal canadian mounted police (rcmp), the canada border services agency, the u.s. department of homeland security and the u.s. customs and border protection agency. rcmp spokeswoman annie delisle confirmed the meeting took place, and said the two sides agreed on an “action plan which outlines a collaborative approach to dealing with the influx”.  an official in the u.s. department of homeland security said the crossings were very limited and did not represent a major security concern. “frankly, it is far more embarrassing to this country than it is threatening,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  the official, and a second person directly involved in border affairs, said u.s. authorities had not mounted a major effort to beef up border security, in part because they lack manpower and equipment. a senior canadian security source classified the risk as medium  to long term, since it was likely that those crossing the border really were seeking asylum. vast stretches of the 5,500 mile (8,900 km) frontier are unguarded and the more images spread of people walking across, the more vulnerable canada could become, said the source. “if we keep this up for a while, and it becomes known that the border really is porous, then people will use it as an opportunity to put (operatives) in,” said the source. exact numbers are hard to calculate, since not all authorities release details. in january and february, 143 people walked illegally over the border into manitoba, local police said. as of feb. 13, some 3,800 people had made an asylum claim in 2017, up from the same period last year, said bardsley. that number, though, includes all people seeking asylum, and the government would not break down the figures.

" a conservative nonprofit group that lobbies republicans to support clean energy policy will spend more than $1 million over the next few weeks to back 10 members of congress running in the nov. 8 elections, hoping to attract key swing voters such as millennials.   citizens for responsible energy solutions (cres) is backing republican house and senate candidates who favor clean energy, even as republican presidential nominee donald trump mocks wind energy and calls climate change a hoax. embracing a clean energy agenda can help republicans win in close races by attracting key voters like millennials and women, and help broaden the republican base, james dozier, cres executive director, told reuters. “the way i look at it is regardless of who is in the oval office, we need clean energy champions on the hill,” said dozier, who added that republicans have ceded the issue to democrats. “this is a ripe opportunity to reframe republicans’ engagement in energy debate,” said dozier. “we see this as an issue the party can use to grow the tent with the next generation of voters, with female voters and hispanics and african americans.” cres kicked off its fall spending campaign last week with more than $200,000 in radio ad buys for alaska senator lisa murkowski and north carolina senator richard burr, who faces a close re election race against challenger deborah ross.  the group will spend an additional $900,000 in support of other republican candidates, including new hampshire senator kelly ayotte, who is neck in neck with democratic governor maggie hassan in her re election bid, and representative joe heck, who is running in the hotly contested race for the open nevada senate seat against democrat catherine cortez masto. on the house side, cres will spend money for ads and voter turnout efforts for representatives from illinois, virginia, florida and new york. cres is not alone in backing republicans who can help the party embrace clean energy policy and accept the science behind climate change. jay faison, a north carolina based businessman, launched the $2 million clear path action fund to launch digital media campaigns for candidates, including ayotte, who support clean energy in key swing states. but these republican efforts are dwarfed by spending from environmental pacs that are spending record amounts to back democrats. the league of conservation voters said it will spend a record $40 million this election cycle. other groups, including green activist billionaire tom steyer’s nextgen and the natural resources defense council action fund, have also announced tens of millions of dollars more in spending.

" president donald trump is asking congress to give the pentagon about $2 billion for a “flexible” fund to use against islamic state over the next six months, as his administration weighs changes to the u.s. led campaign against the militant group. trump is also seeking to upgrade long underfunded facilities at the u.s. military’s guantanamo bay detention center in cuba that trump’s democratic predecessor, barack obama, unsuccessfully sought to close during his eight year administration. “it doesn’t seem like we are going to close it anytime soon,” john roth, the acting pentagon comptroller, told a pentagon news briefing, explaining the move.  the proposals were part of a $30 billion supplemental request to congress to add more money to the pentagon’s budget during the government’s ongoing fiscal year, which began under the obama administration and ends in september. it includes plans to crank up u.s. funding for the fight against islamic state militants for items like high tech bombs and defenses against insurgents’ drones, bringing overall spending on the campaign to the highest level yet, the pentagon said. “this will likely be our largest request,” roth said. one analyst called the $2 billion flexible spending request a pentagon “slush fund,” and many lawmakers were expected to be reluctant to loosen oversight over how the pentagon spends money. what trump’s additional funding might mean for america’s evolving war strategy against islamic state in the coming months was not immediately clear.  but the request comes as u.s. backed forces in iraq and syria are entering a critical phase in their campaign to retake islamic state’s two biggest cities of mosul in iraq and raqqa in syria. trump’s administration is weighing deployment of more u.s. troops. the heads of the top u.s. congressional committees that oversee the pentagon have criticized trump’s 2018 budget request, saying even more money was needed. “it is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage,” said republican representative mac thornberry, chairman of the house of representatives armed services committee.  todd harrison at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington questioned whether trump’s budget wish list could muster enough support among democrats,  whose votes would be needed to sign off on the spending bills given the slim republican hold on the senate.        trump said during the election campaign that he not only wanted to keep the guantanamo bay detention center open but “load it up with some bad dudes.” trump’s $5.1 billion “overseas contingency operations” request included a provision for $1.1 billion in additional funds for a range of pentagon projects, including “planning and design of construction projects in support of detention operations at guantanamo bay, cuba.” the prison, which was opened by republican president george w. bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. obama reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail. the 2017 request would also hike spending for the broader defense department over the next six months, with $24.9 billion more sought to “readiness needs” after years of complaints over congressionally imposed spending caps. lockheed martin would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that proposal. some $13.5 billion would be spent on more military hardware, including five f 35 warplanes as well as army blackhawk helicopters made by sikorsky aircraft, a lockheed subsidiary.  trump also wants 12 interceptors for the thaad missile defense system. the united states is now deploying thaad in south korea in response to north korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. boeing would also gain with $2.4 billion for an additional 24 of its f/a 18 e/f jet fighters.  a further $7.2 billion would pay for things like military training, cyber and intelligence capabilities and support for  weapons systems.

" former u.s. president jimmy carter was receiving hospital care on thursday after becoming dehydrated at a charity house building project in canada, but he is doing “ok,” habitat for humanity said. carter, 92, became unsteady at the construction site and slumped away from his work area to a chair, according to eyewitnesses, who said he was working for more than an hour on steps of the home, using a drill. several workers helped him to sit, and he was later taken away by ambulance. his medical issue resulted from dehydration, the carter center said in a statement. he had been working on a building project with habitat for humanity, a charitable organization promoting affordable home ownership. carter was taken to st. boniface general hospital for treatment, according to the carter center, which is based in atlanta. “president carter told us he is ok and is being taken offsite for observation,” habitat said in a statement, noting he had been working in the hot sun. “he encourages everyone to stay hydrated and keep building.” carter, a democrat who served in the white house from january 1977 to january 1981, received the nobel peace prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work.     carter, whose family had a history of cancer, disclosed in august 2015 that he had been diagnosed with melanoma, a form of skin cancer, that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. but by december of that year carter told his church that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. the peanut farmer from georgia has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in u.s. history. through his work on global issues, he became widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, having left office profoundly unpopular. in canada, carter had been volunteering with a project to build 150 homes with habitat for humanity in honor of the country’s 150th birthday. the organization noted that carter had requested that others involved with the effort continue their work for the day. carter and his wife, rosalynn carter, have traveled around the world working with habitat since 1984, according to the organization. she was with him at the hospital, the carter foundation said.

" u.s. democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders said on friday he would vote for hillary clinton to stop republican donald trump from winning the white house, a lukewarm show of support that his campaign said was not a formal endorsement. sanders’ comments come after weeks of pressure from democratic party officials to throw his weight behind clinton, the presumptive nominee. she locked up the required number of delegates this month with a string of wins in state by state primary contests. clinton, the former u.s. secretary of state, senator, and first lady, needs sanders’ supporters to boost her chances against trump in the nov. 8 election. only 40 percent of them say they would vote for her, with the rest undecided or divided between trump, a third party candidate and staying home, according to reuters/ipsos polling.  asked if he would vote for clinton in november, sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, told msnbc television: “yes. the issue right here is i’m going to do everything i can to defeat donald trump. i think trump in so many ways would be a disaster for this country if he were elected president.” “we do not need a president whose cornerstone of his campaign is bigotry, who is insulting mexicans and latinos and muslims and women, who does not believe in the reality of climate change,” he continued. a spokeswoman for sanders said his comments on msnbc did not amount to an endorsement of clinton, adding that “senator sanders is also still an active candidate.” trump has angered minority groups with his hard line on immigration, including calls to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and build a wall along the u.s. mexican border if he is elected.  a spokeswoman for trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the wealthy new york businessman has rejected accusations his proposals are bigoted, and has said his policies would help minorities by bolstering the economy and creating jobs. trump has also called climate change a hoax by the chinese to hurt business in the united states.       sanders, a self described democratic socialist, managed to turn his long shot run into a mass movement with proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to healthcare and education, and defend the environment. his challenge to clinton, one of the best known figures in u.s. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign. sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the democratic national convention in philadelphia from july 25 28, when clinton’s nomination is expected to become official. he has also made clear he does not want his presence to hurt the party’s chances of holding onto the white house.  three quarters of likely democratic voters in the general election say sanders should have a “major role” in shaping the party’s positions, according to a reuters/ipsos poll conducted june 17 21. nearly two thirds also said that sanders should endorse clinton.

" british foreign secretary boris johnson held almost an hour of talks with iranian president hassan rouhani on sunday after flying to tehran to seek the release of a jailed british iranian aid worker.  both spoke forthrightly about the obstacles in the relationship and agreed on the need to make progress in all areas,  said a spokeswoman for britain s foreign office after johnson concluded what was only the third visit to iran by a british foreign minister in the past 14 years. the foreign office confirmed johnson had raised  consular cases of dual nationals  during talks. these cases include nazanin zaghari ratcliffe, who britain says was visiting family on holiday in april 2016 when she was jailed by iran for attempting to overthrow the government.    the woman s husband later told sky news that a court appearance scheduled in iran for sunday had been postponed.  i think i am very optimistic today,  richard ratcliffe said. he added that he hoped his wife would be home before christmas but cautioned that there could still be setbacks.  without doubt having the foreign secretary there was a big thing. without doubt the court case not happening is a big thing. there may be a number of big things that have to happen before she s home, but ... as i sit here i am a lot more optimistic than i was.   iranian state television had reported that  bilateral relations, the nuclear deal and regional developments made up the axis of the talks , between the president and johnson. two day visit the case of zaghari ratcliffe has taken on domestic political importance after johnson said last month that she had  been teaching journalists in iran, which her employer denies. johnson later apologized. opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. johnson met ali akbar salehi, head of iran s atomic energy organization earlier on sunday and had talks with his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif on saturday. the two day visit took place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions.  it has been a worthwhile visit and we leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal,  the foreign office spokeswoman added. international sanctions against iran have only recently been lifted as part of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal to curb tehran s disputed uranium enrichment program.  that deal is under threat after u.s. president donald trump decided to decertify iran s compliance with its terms. johnson told zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented. zaghari ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in iran, but has become the most high profile case. a project manager with the thomson reuters foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. she denies the charges. the thomson reuters foundation is a charity organization that is independent of thomson reuters and operates independently of reuters news. it says zaghari ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in iran.

" kenya s opposition leader raila odinga said on tuesday he wants an interim government to run the country for six months while the constitution is reviewed to curb the president s authority. odinga told reuters in an interview that he was open to talks with president uhuru kenyatta over a constitutional review aimed at lowering the risk of violence from minority groups who feel excluded from power.  kenyatta was re elected with 98 percent of the vote on oct. 26 after odinga boycotted the election, saying it would not be fair. the repeat presidential vote followed an election in august, which kenyatta also won but which was nullified by the supreme court on procedural grounds.  odinga s supporters have repeatedly protested against the results, and at least 51 people have been killed in the turmoil since august, generating an atmosphere of uncertainty in east africa s richest economy.   a pure presidential system enhances ethnicity because each community believes that they are not safe unless their man is at the top,  odinga said in the interview in his office.  three of kenya s presidents since independence from britain in 1963 have been from the kikuyu ethnic group and one has been from the kalenjin group, although there are 44 recognized ethnic groups in the nation.  the current president is a kikuyu and his deputy is a kalenjin, and many of odinga s supporters, who are largely drawn from other ethnic groups, say they feel excluded from power.  the 2010 constitution devolved some power and money to kenya s 47 counties, spreading the opportunities for power and political patronage. but most of the budget and the power is still in the hands of the central government, something odinga wants to change.   we had a new constitution that we enacted in 2010; we think that now it is time to revisit it,  he said.  a constitutional review could strengthen institutions like the election board and cut down the powers of the presidency, he said.  we think that maybe six months will be required to carry out all these changes that we need in this country.  odinga served as prime minister in a coalition government that was crafted in 2008 after two months of violence following a disputed election killed 1,200 people. after the oct. 26 election, odinga s opposition alliance called for civil disobedience, including protests and a boycott of products and services by firms friendly to kenyatta s government, to force reforms.  the opposition did not challenge kenyatta s oct. 26 victory at the supreme court and there has been no protest action, but voter and rights activists lodged cases on monday. the court has 14 days to review them.

" democrat hillary clinton on tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the united states as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the affordable care act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. since launching her campaign in april 2015, clinton has said she wants to be the “small business president” if she wins the nov. 8 election against businessman donald trump, the republican nominee. trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help “jump start america.” clinton’s campaign held a conference call with small business owners on tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state’s campaign. “you will always have a seat at the table,” clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in virginia and michigan. small businesses play a vital economic role in the united states, making up 99.7 percent of u.s. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of u.s. private sector jobs, according to the small business administration.  the proposals announced by clinton’s campaign on tuesday fill in details on how the democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. “they tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in america,” clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. “i’d like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,” clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would be entrepreneurs.  clinton’s campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about u.s. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. clinton’s running mate, u.s. senator tim kaine, discussed the new proposals during a tuesday roundtable with small business owners in colorado, a battleground state.

" a federal judge in new jersey on tuesday ordered the release of a list of unindicted co conspirators in the criminal case against two former allies of republican governor chris christie in a 2013 scandal involving lane closures on the george washington bridge. u.s. district judge susan wigenton in newark ruled in favor of several media organizations that sought the list, saying the public interest in seeing names linked to “bridgegate” outweighed the privacy interests of those named. u.s. attorney paul fishman had opposed the release, citing the potential harm to reputations and privacy, and saying the co conspirator designation “will become relevant, if at all” only at trial. a spokesman for fishman declined to comment. last may, fishman’s office unveiled criminal charges against bridget kelly, a former christie deputy chief of staff, and bill baroni, a former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey. the defendants were accused of wire fraud and civil rights deprivation for arranging the september 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in fort lee, new jersey, allegedly to punish the democratic mayor there for not endorsing christie’s successful reelection bid. the closures snarled traffic for several days, causing big delays for drivers and hurting local businesses. kelly and baroni have pleaded not guilty. david wildstein, another former port authority official, pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges. christie has not been charged, and has denied involvement in wrongdoing. in her decision, wigenton said the scandal has received such extensive media coverage that “very little” remained private. she also called it likely that anyone on the list would be a public employee, or an elected or appointed official. “although privacy for third parties is indeed important, this court is satisfied that the privacy interests of uncharged third parties are insufficiently compelling to outweigh the public’s right of access,” she wrote. bruce rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, on tuesday asked the judge for the “immediate” release of the list. christie made an unsuccessful run for the white house this year. he was chosen on monday to lead the white house transition team for donald trump, the only candidate left in the race to be the republican candidate in the nov. 8 presidential election.

" u.s. president donald trump on sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts russian president vladimir putin’s denials of meddling in the u.s. election last year. at a news conference in vietnam, trump distanced himself from remarks he made on saturday in which he suggested he believed putin when he said there had been no russian meddling in the election that took him to the white house. the comments had drawn criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling. “as to whether i believe it or not, i’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” trump said at a news conference with vietnamese president tran dai quang.  “as currently led, by fine people, i believe very much in our intelligence agencies.” he was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. former u.s. intelligence director james clapper had told reuters: “the fact the president of the united states would take putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  the russian issue has clouded trump’s first year in office and his comments on saturday were a distraction from his    five nation asia tour. trump said he still believed putin did not think there had been russian meddling.     “i believe that president putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” trump said, while adding: “what he believes is what he believes.”  trump said he was not interested in arguing with putin over meddling and wanted to get on with russia to work on world problems including north korea, syria and ukraine. trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax. a special counsel, robert mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his associate rick gates. u.s. intelligence agencies have also concluded russians interfered to tip the election in trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

" the trump administration plans to cap the number of refugees admitted to the united states in the coming year at 45,000, two people with knowledge of the decision said on tuesday, and advocates said this historically low level is insufficient in the face of growing humanitarian crises worldwide. that figure would be the lowest ceiling for refugee admissions since the u.s. refugee act was signed in 1980. since then, the ceiling has never been set below 67,000 and in recent years has been around 70,000 to 80,000.  the secretaries of state and homeland security are consulting with members of congress on wednesday, according to one white house official. the president’s decision on the refugee limit will be announced following that consultation, two officials said. the wall street journal first reported the 45,000 figure on tuesday. by law, the president is required to consult with members of congress about the number of refugee admissions before the start of each fiscal year, on oct. 1.  the number of refugees actually admitted to the country, which can fall below the cap, dropped to its lowest in the fiscal year after the sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks with only around 27,000 admitted. for fiscal year 2017, which ends sept. 30, former president barack obama established a cap of 110,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the united states.  after taking office in january, president donald trump issued an executive order lowering the maximum number to 50,000 for 2017, saying that more would be “detrimental to the interests of the united states.”  critics said if the 2018 level is set even lower, it could damage the international reputation of the united states.  “it’s tragic,” said robert carey, former director of the office of refugee resettlement under obama. “it’s really moving away from the commitments the government has had for protections of refugees from both republican and democratic administrations,” he said. “some people will die.” in a speech to the united nations last week, trump said that more could be done to help refugees in their home regions. offering financial assistance to hosting countries “is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach,” trump said. but that type of assistance “ignores all the people who have fled to places that are still not safe,” said another former obama administration official, anne richard. “those are the people that the u.s. program really rescues,” said richard, a former assistant secretary for  refugees and migration at the state department. she said other countries might try to follow suit by closing the door to more refugees.   a september 2016 study by the libertarian think tank the cato institute found that of 3.3 million refugees admitted to the united states between 1975 through 2015, 20 were convicted of planning or committing a terrorist attack on u.s. soil.  a spokesman for the department of homeland security declined to comment ahead of trump’s final decision on the cap. the state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. david inserra from the conservative think tank the heritage foundation said congress should have more of a say in setting the cap to avoid radical swings in the numbers when there is a change in administrations. “when president obama increased the number dramatically republicans said they didn’t want that but the consultation process didn’t give them any authority to stop it,” he said. “now the same is going to be true for the other side.” ",0

" a group of u.s. lawmakers said on monday they had requested more information from president donald trump’s administration about the potential sale of precision guided munitions to saudi arabia, expressing concern about civilian casualties in riyadh’s campaign in yemen that delayed the deal last year. thirty mostly democratic lawmakers signed the letter to u.s. secretary of state, rex tillerson, and secretary of defense, james mattis, citing expectations that the administration plans to go ahead with the sale. “as you know, the previous administration made the decision in december 2016 to halt a planned sale of precision guided munitions (pgm) to saudi arabia due to concerns over widespread civilian casualties and significant deficiencies in rsaf’s (the saudi air force’s) targeting capabilities,” the letter, dated friday but released on monday, said. “according to recent reports, however, the state department has now reversed course and removed the suspension on these pgm sales,” they said in the letter, led by representative ted lieu, a democratic member of the house foreign affairs committee. the state and defense departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to congress. in december, then president barack obama’s administration decided to halt the sale of the systems, manufactured by raytheon co, that convert bombs into precision guided munitions because of concerns about the extent of civilian casualties during saudi arabia’s campaign in yemen. congressional aides told reuters the trump administration was on the verge of sending a formal notification to congress about the sale, which would trigger the formal 30 day review to allow members of congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. trump has said he wants to clear the way for u.s. arms sales abroad, to bolster efforts by u.s. partners to fight militant groups and help create u.s. jobs. his administration recently told congress it also planned to pursue sales to bahrain and nigeria that had been delayed under obama by human rights concerns. congressional aides said they expected an effort to pass legislation to stop the pgm sale. however, such legislation has never succeeded. a measure seeking to block the sale of tanks to riyadh failed in september. “it is in our national security interest – as well as that of our saudi partners   to ensure that the rsaf has the ability to avoid civilian casualties before the u.s. sells them any additional air to ground munitions,” the letter said.

" international researchers investigating the death of chilean poet pablo neruda raised doubts on friday as to whether he died of cancer 44 years ago as previously presumed, and did not rule out foul play. neruda, known for his passionate love poems and staunch communist views, died days after a coup in september 1973 that ushered in the brutal dictatorship of augusto pinochet. neruda s chauffeur claimed pinochet s agents took advantage of the poet s illness to inject poison into his stomach as he lay in hospital. neruda s body was exhumed in 2013 and previous tests have found no evidence of poison but are ongoing.  spanish forensic specialist aurelio luna from the university of murcia told journalists that his team discovered something that could possibly be a laboratory cultivated bacteria. it will be analyzed, with results expected in six months to a year. luna also said that tests indicated that death from prostrate cancer was not likely at the moment when neruda died.  from analysis of the data we cannot accept that the poet had been in an imminent situation of death at the moment of entering the hospital,  he said.   we cannot confirm if the nature of pablo neruda s death was natural or violent,  he added. pinochet died in 2006. neruda s family and supporters have been divided over whether the case should be closed and his remains returned to his grave near his coastal home of isla negra, or whether researchers should continue carrying out tests.

" a federal appeals court on monday brought to an end president barack obama’s bid to overturn a ruling that threatens to gut his signature healthcare law by putting the case on hold until after president elect donald trump, who aims to repeal obamacare, takes office. the obama administration had appealed a judge’s may ruling favoring the challenge filed by republicans in the u.s. house of representatives against a key part of the 2010 law. but the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit agreed to a request by the republicans to delay its consideration of the government’s appeal until after trump takes office on jan. 20. the obama administration opposed the move. if the law is repealed by congress, the case would be moot. the court’s decision to put the case on hold will not have an immediate effect on the law, as the lower court ruling was put on hold pending the appeal. the court said both sides should provide an update on the status of the case by feb. 21. the challenge targeted government reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law required them to make to customers’ out of pocket medical payments. trump has said he favors repealing and replacing obamacare but would consider retaining certain elements.  the law has enabled millions of previously uninsured americans to obtain health insurance, but republicans condemn obamacare as a government overreach and have mounted a series of legal challenges. the obama administration appealed u.s. district judge rosemary collyer’s ruling that the government cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds without congressional approval to provide subsidies under the healthcare law to private insurers to help people afford medical coverage. the house republicans argued that the administration violated the u.s. constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending. the obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by congress. the u.s. supreme court in 2012 and 2015 issued major rulings authored by conservative chief justice john roberts that preserved obamacare and rejected conservative challenges.

" the fbi’s deputy director, andrew mccabe, will appear for a closed door interview on thursday with two key u.s. congressional committees, after republicans asked him to discuss the bureau’s handling of its hillary clinton email probe. the justice department confirmed in a letter on wednesday to the chairmen of the house of representatives judiciary and oversight committees that mccabe will sit for a transcribed interview, but said mccabe will not be permitted to discuss anything related to special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. it said the interview must be conducted in a classified setting and that the transcript should not be publicly released. the federal bureau of investigation is part of the justice department. the republican led house judiciary and oversight committees announced in october they were launching fresh probes into a number of long standing political grievances, including concerns over the fbi’s handling of the investigation of clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. republicans have said they want to get to the bottom of why former fbi director james comey, who was fired by president donald trump, publicly discussed the clinton investigation and announced that the bureau would not seek to bring charges. comey also publicly revealed, just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, that he was reopening the matter after the fbi discovered a new batch of clinton emails. the case was closed shortly after the emails were reviewed, and no new information was uncovered. critics say the republicans’ focus on clinton is merely a tactic to distract from mueller’s investigation and whether members of trump’s campaign colluded with russia. since the new clinton probe was announced, republicans have also turned up the pressure on mueller and attacked the fbi’s integrity, after anti trump text messages surfaced between two fbi employees who worked on mueller’s team. one of the employees, agent peter strzok, was reassigned after the texts were discovered. the other, fbi lawyer lisa page, completed her temporary 45 day detail assignment with mueller in mid july.  republican have also asked the justice department to make page, who works in the fbi’s general counsel’s office, available for interviews. trump has openly attacked the fbi, saying its reputation is in “tatters.” russia has denied meddling in the election, and trump has said there was no collusion.

" colombia s notorious golfo clan crime gang, one of the country s most violent, has told the government it is willing to surrender, president juan manuel santos said on tuesday. the group, also known the usuga clan, is accused of operating profitable drug trafficking routes in partnership with mexican cartels and taking part in illegal gold mining.   we received an expression of willingness by the head of the golfo clan to turn themselves in, to submit to justice,  president juan manuel santos said at an event in bogota.  i have asked the justice minister and the attorney general to evaluate it.  the government is not going to negotiate with the gang, santos said, because members are criminals, and not politically motivated rebels like the farc and eln guerrilla groups.  the group formerly known as the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, who have kept their farc acronym for their new political party, signed a peace deal with the government last year, while the national liberation army (eln) is in peace talks.  if they surrender to justice, the law could give them some benefits, depending on the surrender conditions,  santos said.  what are they handing over, what is its value to society, for colombians.  the united states has offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the capture of golfo gang leader dario antonio usuga, known by his alias otoniel.    second in command roberto vargas, alias gavilan, was killed by the army in a shoot out last week. the group is infamous for a series of police officer assassinations in the andean country.

" virginia officials started recounts on wednesday in the first of four state house of delegates races, a process that could lead to a democratic takeover of the chamber after the party’s historic election gains last month. republicans have a narrow 51 49 majority in the house after democrats erased a two to one advantage in november, part of the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. four of the legislative races were close enough to lead to recounts. if democrats gain one seat in the house, the chamber would be tied 50 50 with no tiebreaking mechanism. governor elect ralph northam is a democrat, and republicans hold a 21 19 edge in the state senate. the first recount was scheduled for wednesday and thursday in suburban washington’s district 58, where republican incumbent tim hugo narrowly won re election by 106 votes over democrat donte tanner. others are planned for next week, including one where the republican leads by only 10 votes. in a recount set for dec. 21 in northern virginia’s district 28, democrat joshua cole trails republican robert thomas by 82 votes. the state elections board has said at least 147 voters were assigned to the wrong district, and voters have filed a federal lawsuit to hold a new election. andrea gaines, a state elections spokeswoman, said in an email that she had no information on when results for the recounts would be announced.

" the white house is declining to offer public support for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies such as apple inc to help law enforcement crack encrypted data, sources familiar with the discussions said. the decision all but assures that the years long political impasse over encryption will continue even in the wake of the high profile effort by the department of justice to force apple to break into an iphone used by a gunman in last december’s  shootings in san bernardino, california. president obama suggested in remarks last month that he had come around to the view that law enforcement agencies needed to have a way to gain access to encrypted information on smartphones.  but the administration remains deeply divided on the issue, the sources said.  the draft legislation from senators richard burr and dianne feinstein, the republican chair and top democrat respectively of the senate intelligence committee, is expected to be introduced as soon as this week.  the bill gives federal judges broad authority to order tech companies to help the government but does not spell out what companies might have to do or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help, according to sources familiar with the text. it also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance. although the white house has reviewed the text and offered feedback, it is expected to provide minimal public input, if any, the sources said.  its stance is partly a reflection of a political calculus that any encryption bill would be controversial and is unlikely to go far in a gridlocked congress during an election year, sources said.  a white house spokesman declined to comment on the pending legislation, but referred to white house press secretary josh earnest’s statements on encryption legislation. last month earnest said the administration is “skeptical” of lawmakers’ ability to resolve the encryption debate given their difficulty in tackling “simple things.” tech companies and civil liberties advocates have opposed encryption legislation, arguing that mandating law enforcement access to tech products will undermine security for everyone. several lawmakers, including u.s. senator ron wyden of oregon, a democrat, have vowed to oppose any attempt to limit encryption protections in u.s. technology products. even some intelligence officials worry that enabling law enforcement agencies to override encryption will create more problems than it solves by opening the door to hackers and foreign intelligence services. some also say it is unnecessary because the government has other means of getting the information it needs.   the justice department dropped its legal action against apple last week, saying it had found a way to hack into the phone.  the white house last year backed away from pursuing legislation that would require u.s. technology firms to provide a “back door” to access encrypted data. the backpedaling resembled a retreat by president bill clinton’s administration in the 1990s on efforts to require a special computer chip in  phones to give the u.s. government a way to monitor encrypted conversations.      but the desire for encryption legislation among some intelligence and law enforcement officials has never gone away, and it gained new life after the islamist militant inspired attacks in paris and san bernardino.  obama, speaking at the south by southwest entertainment festival in austin, texas, last month, warned against “fetishizing our phones” and said that doing nothing to address law enforcement’s encryption challenges “can’t be the right answer.”  obama, however, also cautioned against congress taking any action that would be “sloppy and rushed.” apple and others have called on congress to help find a solution to the problem of criminals and terrorists using encryption to avoid surveillance. a separate proposal to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue is also not expected to be enacted this year. meanwhile, tech companies are stepping up their efforts to implement encryption and other security measures. the facebook owned messaging service whatsapp announced this week that it had implemented complete encryption of its service   and now cannot get access to customer messages even if was ordered to by a court.

" pope john paul i, who served for just 33 days as pontiff in 1978 before his abrupt death, has moved a step closer to sainthood, the vatican said on thursday. known as the  smiling pope  because of his good nature, albino luciani s reign as head of the catholic church was the shortest in modern times and his shock demise fueled press speculation that he might have been murdered. the vatican has always denied the rumors, saying he died of a heart attack. as a first step to placing him among the church s swelling ranks of saints, the vatican said pope francis had backed a vote by the congregation for the causes of the saints to recognize the  heroic virtues  of pope john paul i. this means john paul i, the last italian to be made pontiff, can now move on toward beatification, the final step before sainthood. beatification would require a miracle attributed to his intercession. the catholic church posthumously confers beatification, and later sainthood, on people considered so holy during their lives that they are now believed to be with god and can intercede with him to perform miracles. miracles are usually the medically unexplained healing of someone. john paul i s sainthood process started in 2002 after his supporters in italy collected some 300,000 signatures on a petition calling for him to be made a saint. it could take many more years for his cause to progress further. luciani, cardinal of venice, was elected pope on aug. 26, 1978. a humble man, he had no time to leave his mark on the church before his death on september 28, 1978.  rumors rapidly surfaced that hidden forces within the church had poisoned the newly elected luciani to head off institutional changes he was planning to introduce. the church s decision not to hold a post mortem on the body, bickering over who was in the vatican on the night of the death and crude attempts to hide the fact a nun found his body was manna to fans of conspiracy theories. luciani s successor john paul ii ruled for 27 years and died in 2005. he was made a saint in 2014   the fastest elevation to the sainthood in modern times.

" u.s. president donald trump’s defense secretary on thursday said he did not see possible military collaboration with russia now, in a blow to moscow’s hopes to mend ties with washington after trump’s election. the remarks are perhaps the strongest indication yet from the trump administration that prospects for any significant cooperation between the u.s. and russian militaries against  islamic state in syria is unlikely anytime soon. they came despite repeated suggestions by trump during his election campaign of the possibility of joint action against islamic state militants.     “we are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level. but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground,” jim mattis told reporters after talks at nato headquarters in brussels, also mentioning u.s. concerns about russian interference in democratic elections. just hours before mattis spoke, russian president vladimir putin said it was in the interests of both nations to restore communications between their intelligence agencies. “it’s absolutely clear that in the area of counter terrorism all relevant governments and international groups should work together,” he told russia’s federal security service (fsb). u.s. intelligence agencies, however, are among the most powerful voice of caution in washington on russia, concluding that moscow hacked and leaked democratic party emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the nov. 8 election in trump’s favor. monday’s resignation of national security adviser michael flynn, who was seen in moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with russia, has underscored for the kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement. flynn resigned after disclosures he had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office, and that he later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations.  asked whether he believed that russia interfered in u.s. presidential elections, mattis said: “right now, i would just say there’s very little doubt that they have either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections in the democracies.” he did not explicitly cite the u.s. election. a kremlin aide said there had been no progress on a potential meeting between trump and putin. “there is no agreement on a meeting nor a clear understanding yet,” interfax news agency quoted kremlin aide yuri ushakov as saying. back and forth mattis, who has previously accused russia of trying to break the nato alliance, told a closed door session of nato on wednesday that it needed to be realistic about the chances of restoring a cooperative relationship with moscow.  he cited moscow’s 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine, which plunged u.s. russia relations to a post cold war low. mattis said nato needed “negotiate from a position of strength” as he called for stepped up military spending. that prompted a terse reply from russia’s defense minister sergei shoigu. “attempts to build a dialogue with russia from a position of strength would be futile,” he was quoted as saying by tass news agency. mattis shot back: “i have no need to respond to the russian statement at all. nato has always stood for military strength and protection of the democracies and the freedoms we intend to pass on to our children.” the back and forth came even as u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov met in germany, and u.s. marine general joseph dunford, the top u.s. military officer, met chief of the russian general staff valery gerasimov in azerbaijan. lavrov dismissed the uproar over the u.s. election. “you should know we do not interfere in the domestic matters of other countries,” he said.  congressional inquiries into alleged russian interference in the u.s. elections are gaining momentum as capitol hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents. the fbi and several u.s. intelligence agencies are investigating russian espionage operations in the united states. they are also looking at contacts in russia between russian intelligence officers or others with ties to putin’s government and people connected to trump or his campaign.

" a panel convened by u.s. president donald trump to tackle the opioid crisis called on wednesday for more treatment programs, tighter prescribing guidelines and additional drug courts to help reduce overdose deaths. the commission, led by new jersey governor chris christie, said the recommendations would require funding by congress but did not recommend an amount. trump last week declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. public health experts broadly welcomed the proposed measures. “this sounds to me like a very progressive and very needed move,” said professor kosali simon, a health economist at indiana university, of the recommendations.     but paul hanly, a new york lawyer representing local governments in a legal battle against opioid makers, said recommendations, while laudable, would be “toothless” without substantial funding. opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl. more than 100 americans die daily from overdoses, according to federal data. the commission recommended a national media campaign to encourage opioid addicts to seek help. only 10.6 percent of people who need treatment get it, the report noted. the media campaign would encourage addicts to “stop being afraid or ashamed of seeking help when facing their addiction.” it urged expansion of drug courts, in which addicts convicted of non violent offenses are diverted into programs that combine treatment with mandatory drug testing and court appearances. the commission said drug courts, which are currently offered in just 44 percent of u.s. counties, should embrace medication assisted treatment to improve outcomes. the u.s. food and drug administration last week announced plans to encourage wider use of substitute opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine, which do not induce a high and are used to help people through drug addiction recovery. still, dr. stefan kertesz of the university of alabama at birmingham said communities often lack treatment facilities where drug courts can send addicts. and many drug courts charge fees that make them unaffordable for many. “drug courts often function as pay to play,” kertesz said. “only people who can come up with money can escape a prison sentence.” the report recommended expanding the ranks of emergency responders allowed to administer naloxone to treat overdoses. it also encouraged stricter prescribing guidelines for physicians.

" democrats on the u.s. senate foreign relations committee have been undertaking their own investigation, without republicans, on what they term “russia’s malign influence around the world,” a spokesman for the democratic side of the committee said on wednesday. sean bartlett, a spokesman for senator ben cardin, who has been leading the effort, said the democrats are preparing a “major report” on how russia seeks to sow distrust and confusion, promote radical voices on divisive issues and gain leverage, while eroding support for democracy and institutions. the investigation was first reported by the daily beast. it comes as a handful of republican led congressional committees, including the senate and house of representatives intelligence committees, as well as special counsel robert mueller, investigate alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election and whether there was collusion between republican president donald trump’s campaign and moscow. trump has denied any collusion. moscow denies meddling. while the foreign relations democrats are not looking into the u.s. contest, they said they had discovered russian led efforts to influence elections in many countries. “the report describes how these efforts are led by the government’s security services and buttressed by state owned enterprises, kremlin aligned oligarchs, and russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state,” bartlett said in an emailed statement. the committee’s investigations have included contacts with foreign governments. ukraine, estonia, latvia, lithuania and poland are among countries that have discussed russian meddling. committee republicans said they were aware of the investigation, but not involved. “we are aware that senator cardin is developing a report on russian efforts to interfere in european elections, but his staff has not yet shared it with us,” said micah johnson, a spokeswoman for senator bob corker, the committee’s republican chairman. it was not clear when the report might be released publicly.

" four serbian men got suspended prison terms on tuesday for taking parts in riots at the u.s. embassy in 2008   a long delayed case that has soured relations between belgrade and washington. the four were convicted of hurling stones at the embassy during protests over perceived u.s. support for kosovan independence. they were not charged over a fire that broke out at the peak of the riots and destroyed part of the building. washington has pressed for prosecutions for almost a decade, but no one has so far been convicted over the blaze which killed one protester.     the four   dejan vucckovic, dragan marinkov, marko novitovic and milan tomas   pleaded not guilty but were convicted of endangering public safety and given two year suspended sentences.  the court ruling said the men s rocks broke windows in the embassy and other protesters later threw in flares that started the fire. another three defendants were acquitted due to lack of evidence. serbia s government and the protesters reacted with fury after kosovo s declaration of independence on feb 21, 2008. serbia considers kosovo its historic heartland and has waged a diplomatic campaign against the secession of the predominantly ethnic albanian region. belgrade lost control of kosovo in 1999 after nato bombing ended serbia s brutal counterinsurgency against albanians there. defense lawyer zelimir cabrilo said the court s verdict had not addressed the political factors behind the riot.  it was a political decision to stage the rally ... to remove (police) security from the embassy,  cabrilo told reporters.    instead, we have light, modest sentences against four persons ... for hurling stones, they were not sentenced for torching it (the embassy).  the case was delayed last year when the serbian court of appeals annulled a lower court s sentencing, citing deficiencies in the ruling, and ordered a retrial.

" russia is within its rights to restrict the operations of u.s. media organizations in russia in retaliation for what moscow calls u.s. pressure on a kremlin backed tv station, a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said on sunday. russian officials have accused washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the u.s. operations of rt, a kremlin funded broadcaster accused by some in washington of interfering in domestic u.s. politics, which it denies. the foreign ministry spokeswoman, maria zakharova, said the full weight of the u.s. authorities was being brought to bear against rt s operations in the united states, and that moscow had the right to respond.  we have never used russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure, or censorship, or some kind of political influence, never,  zakharova said in an interview with russia s ntv broadcaster.  but this is a particular case.  she cited a 1991 russian law which, she said, stated that if a russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country, then moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside russia.  correspondingly, everything that russian journalists and the rt station are subject to on u.s. soil, after we qualified it as restriction of their activities, we can apply similar measures to american journalists, american media here, on russian territory,  zakharova said. she did not identify any specific u.s. media outlets that would be targeted. she said it made no difference from the russian government s point of view if those outlets were backed by the u.s. state, or privately funded. late last month, russia s state communications regulator accused u.s. tv channel cnn international of violating its license to broadcast in russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster s representatives in connection with the matter. the watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation. the head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved. u.s. intelligence officials, in a report in january this year into allegations of russian interference in the u.s. presidential election, said rt was part of a state run propaganda machine that supported a kremlin campaign to influence u.s. politics. russia today, and russian officials, have denied any attempt to interfere in u.s. politics. they say that political forces in the united states are whipping up hysteria about russia s influence to discredit president donald trump.

" koch industries, the private conglomerate owned by billionaire conservatives charles and david koch, warned on wednesday that a republican tax reform proposal meant to encourage u.s. exports could have devastating effects on the economy and consumers. the proposal, known as border adjustability, is part of a larger tax reform plan backed by republicans in the house of representatives, including speaker paul ryan. it has attracted the attention of advisers to president elect donald trump as a potential tool for creating manufacturing jobs for blue collar americans. but the provision, which would tax imports while exempting u.s. exports from corporate income tax, has raised concerns in the retailing and energy sectors about its potential effects on prices for imported consumer items and foreign goods used in domestic production. corporate lobbyists say that trump’s threatened 35 percent import tax against u.s. companies that move jobs overseas could reflect an interest by the president elect in a border adjusted approach to tax reform. the trump team and republicans in congress are currently trying to hammer out an agreement on tax reform for 2017.      “the proposed border tax adjustment will distort the market, increase consumer prices and create an uneven playing field for companies and consumers,” philip ellender, who oversees government and public affairs for the wichita, kansas based multinational, said in a statement. “the long term consequences to the economy and the american consumer could be devastating,” added ellender, who said koch otherwise supports tax reform. koch is the second largest private u.s. company, with operations that range from refining and chemicals to ranching and forest products. its owners are known to spend heavily on conservative initiatives and to oppose government intervention in business. representative kevin brady, republican chairman of the house tax committee that produced the reform plan, welcomed the koch statement as feedback but described border adjustability as “a key provision” that would level the playing field for “made in america” products.  brady has said the plan would unleash economic and job growth by cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, simplifying the tax code and encouraging investment. border adjustability would help pay for tax cuts by generating $1.2 trillion in revenues over a decade, according to the non partisan tax policy center.  the provision would also discourage u.s. companies from moving operations abroad as a result of another provision, which would eliminate u.s. taxes on the foreign profits of u.s. multinationals.

" republicans in the u.s. house of representatives said on friday  they would advance legislation next year to chop individual and corporate u.s. tax rates. the tax plan, unveiled by house speaker paul ryan and other republican lawmakers at the u.s. capitol, is the sixth and final plank of a conservative policy agenda being rolled out in an effort to unify republicans after a divisive primary campaign for the party’s presidential nominee. ryan, the highest ranking elected republican, said the proposal would provide a clear direction for u.s. economic leadership and was needed amid global uncertainty that was exemplified by the british vote to leave the european union. “for all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong, powerful, confident, american economic leadership is in need, and this does that,” he said. washington has been unable to summon the political will to reform the loophole riddled tax code for nearly three decades. overhauling the code has long been a goal of ryan, a self described policy wonk. he was considered the republican party’s leading voice on taxes and budgets before he ascended to the job of speaker last year. but the labor powerhouse afl cio scorned the republican blueprint as similar to a tax cutting proposal made last year by presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, who ryan recently endorsed. ryan and trump “have striking resemblance   both tax plans benefit the wealthy & corps a lot,” the afl cio said on twitter.  trump’s ideas about taxes have appeared contradictory at times. he said in may he is open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off prior proposals to reduce taxes on all americans and corporations by slashing rates even more deeply than ryan and house republicans would. democrats, including presidential front runner hillary clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest americans for years. house democratic leader nancy pelosi criticized the republican plan as “massive tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires on the backs of hard working american families.” the plan would consolidate the current seven tax brackets for individuals to three, and lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, higher than the 25 percent that ryan proposed when he chaired the house budget committee.  ryan said the goal was to make things so simple the average american could do their taxes on a postcard. the plan would lead to a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on small business income. it would also lower the top u.s. corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world, to 20 percent, as well as shift to a “territorial” style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of american companies abroad from u.s. taxation. the blueprint also calls for overhauling the tax collecting internal revenue service, an idea that animates many conservatives who have called for its abolition.

" chinese distributors of overseas publications must verify that the content is legal in china, beijing said late on sunday, after a major western publisher blocked access to some content in the country citing local regulations. springer nature, which publishes science magazines nature and scientific american, said last week that it had pulled access to less than 1 percent of its articles in china, which it said was regrettable but necessary to avoid all content being blocked.  all publications imported into the chinese market must accord with chinese laws and regulations. the publications  import management company is responsible for carrying out content checks on publications,  the state council information office, the chinese government s information and propaganda arm, said in a faxed response to a request for comment sent by reuters last wednesday. the chinese government made a similar statement after britain s cambridge university press (cup) in august removed and then reposted about 300 papers and book reviews published by the china quarterly journal from its chinese website. under president xi jinping, beijing has heightened censorship, tightened controls on the internet, and strengthened communist party authority over academia and other institutions. cup s decision was originally taken at the request of the chinese government, the publisher said at the time. cup later reversed its decision after an outcry from academics who said the decision impinged upon academic freedom. springer nature in a statement last week denied that its decision to limit some content was a form of editorial censorship, saying that the move was local to china and was taken to comply with specific regulations as enforced by distributors. the publisher said that not complying would mean it ran the risk of being banned from distributing all content in china, which it said was not in the interests of its authors and customers or the wider scientific or academic communities. at least 1,000 springer nature articles had been blocked in china, containing sensitive key words like taiwan, tibet and cultural revolution, the financial times reported. one of springer nature s china distributors, the state run china national publications import and export (group) corp, did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by reuters on monday. it was unclear if the decision by springer nature to block content followed a request by just one of its china distributors or a number of different distributors. it was also unclear whether the distributor request was made at the behest of the chinese government.

" lebanon is too weak to bear the consequences of saad al hariri s resignation as prime minister and cannot afford to side against iran, lebanese druze leader walid jumblatt said on saturday after hariri stepped down. hariri, an ally of saudi arabia, said there was an assassination plot against him and attacked iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah during his resignation speech on saturday. hariri s resignation thrusts lebanon back onto the front line of saudi iranian regional rivalry and seems likely to exacerbate sectarian tensions between lebanese sunni and shi ite muslims.  i am concerned about the economy, of course, and i am concerned about politics. we cannot afford to fight the iranians from lebanon,  jumblatt told reuters. he advocated compromise with hezbollah in lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow saudi iranian dialogue.    lebanon has enough problems. it is too weak for such a resignation, because it will have a tremendous negative impact,  said jumblatt, one of lebanon s most influential politicians. he described hariri s resignation as  incomprehensible . the druze are an important minority in lebanon s sectarian system of government. jumblatt has frequently played kingmaker in lebanese politics.

" u.s. president barack obama has ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on jan. 20, the white house said on friday. in october, the u.s. government formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election, and obama has said he warned russian president vladimir putin about consequences for the attacks. the review and its timeline are a signal that obama wants the issue addressed before he hands power to president elect donald trump, who cast doubt on russia’s hacking role and praised putin during the campaign.   obama’s homeland security adviser, lisa monaco, told reporters the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. “the president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process ... and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the congress,” she said during an event hosted by the christian science monitor. white house spokesman eric schultz said the review would be a “deep dive” that would look for a pattern of such behavior over several years during election time, dating as far back as the 2008 presidential election.  he noted that obama wanted the review completed under his watch. “this is a major priority,” schultz said. during his campaign for the white house, trump called on russia to dig up missing emails from his opponent, hillary clinton, from her time as secretary of state under obama, a fellow democrat. that move prompted critics to accuse him of encouraging foreign actors to conduct espionage. the new york businessman has said he is not convinced russia was behind the attacks. “i don’t believe they interfered,” trump told time magazine about russia in an interview published this week. “that became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. any time i do something, they say, ‘oh, russia interfered.’” people trump has nominated for top national security posts in his new administration have taken a harsher stance toward moscow. russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the u.s. election. obama has come under pressure from democratic lawmakers to declassify more intelligence on the alleged hackings. a government source said the review was sparked in part to respond to those demands as well as to determine how much material related to the subject could be made public. “given president elect trump’s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before president obama leaves office next month,” rep. adam schiff of california, the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee, said in a statement. monaco said cyber attacks were not new but might have crossed a “new threshold” this year.  when she was working as a senior federal bureau of investigation official in 2008, she said, the agency alerted the presidential campaigns of then senator obama and republican senator john mccain that china had infiltrated their respective systems. “we’ve seen in 2008 and in this last election system malicious cyber activity,” monaco said. asked if trump’s transition team was not concerned enough about russia’s influence on the election or about other threats to the united states such as infectious disease outbreaks, monaco said it was too soon to say. she noted that she had not met with her successor because the trump team had yet to name one.

" president donald trump on tuesday signed an order to undo obama era climate change regulations, keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question u.s. support for an international deal to fight global warming. flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, trump proclaimed his “energy independence” executive order at the headquarters of the environmental protection agency.  the move drew swift backlash from a coalition of 23 states and local governments, as well as environmental groups, which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court. the order’s main target is former president barack obama’s clean power plan, which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants   a key factor in the united states’ ability to meet its commitments under a climate change accord reached by nearly 200 countries in paris in 2015.  trump’s decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions. carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth. “i am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on american energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job killing regulations,” trump said at the epa.  the room was filled with miners, coal company executives and staff from industry groups, who applauded loudly as trump spoke. shares in u.s. coal companies edged higher in response.   the wide ranging order is the boldest yet in trump’s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign.  energy analysts and executives have questioned whether the moves will have a big effect on their industries, and environmentalists have called them reckless. “i cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but i can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,” kentucky coal association president tyler white told reuters. environmental groups heaped scorn on trump’s order, arguing it was dangerous and went against the broader global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. a coalition of mostly democrat led states and local governments issued a statement saying they would oppose the order in court. “we won’t hesitate to protect those we serve — including by aggressively opposing in court president trump’s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change,” the coalition, led by new york attorney general eric schneiderman, said in a statement.  the coalition includes states such as california, massachusetts and virginia, as well as cities including chicago, philadelphia and boulder, colorado. u.s. presidents have aimed to reduce u.s. dependence on foreign oil since the arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. but the united states still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in japan and india combined. an overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  but trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and trump promised during his campaign to pull the united states out of the paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt u.s. business.  since being elected, trump has been mum on the paris deal and the executive order does not address it. christiana figueres, former executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change who helped broker the paris accord, lamented trump’s order. “trying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector, with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate, is going against the flow of economics,” she said. the order directs the epa to start a formal process to undo the clean power plan, which was introduced by obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by republican controlled states.  the clean power plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. some 85 percent of u.s. states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented, according to bill becker, director of the national association of clean air agencies, a group of state and local air pollution control agencies. trump’s order also lifts the interior department’s bureau of land management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by obama in 2016 as part of a review to study the program’s impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers. it also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting, and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities.

" the european parliament urged eu leaders on wednesday to allow the next phase of brexit negotiations to start, backing a motion that recognised the talks had advanced sufficiently as a well a line criticising britain s lead negotiator david davis. european union leaders are almost certain to judge on friday that  sufficient progress  has been made on the rights of citizens, the brexit divorce bill and the irish border to allow negotiations to move to the next phase. the eu executive recommended last week that leaders approve the start of trade talks. the european parliament will have to approve any brexit deal, although its motion on wednesday, backed by 556 votes for to 62 against, was not binding.  the eu s brexit negotiator michel barnier told lawmakers the next phase of talks would focus on a  short and defined  transition period and initial discussions on a future relationship. future talks, he said, would be no less difficult.  they are tough, very tough because the issues are extremely complicated and because the consequences of brexit are very serious,  he said, adding that british prime minister theresa may was  courageous  and deserved respect. nigel farage of the anti eu ukip party called her  theresa the appeaser  and said she had yielded on virtually everything. barnier stressed that britain could not renege on commitments made to ensure the talks moved on.  the agreement presented in a joint report last friday was, in the view of some in brussels, undermined by davis s comment that it was more  a statement of intent  than legally binding. davis has subsequently said he wants the accord swiftly translated into a legal text.   we will not accept any going back on this joint report. this progress has been agreed and will be rapidly translated into a withdrawal accord that is legally binding in all three areas and on some others that remain to be negotiated,  barnier said. a lot more steps were required to secure an orderly withdrawal, he added.  we are not at the end of the road, neither regarding citizens  rights nor for the other subjects of the orderly withdrawal. we remain vigilant,  barnier told the parliament.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on monday: trump says the united states will be “tweaking” its trade relationship with canada, stopping short of calling for a major realignment in a development likely to please visiting canadian prime minister justin trudeau. trump is evaluating the situation surrounding u.s. national security adviser michael flynn over his russian contacts, trump’s spokesman says, pointedly declining to make a public show of support for the aide. the u.s. senate votes to confirm former banker and hollywood financier steven mnuchin as treasury secretary, installing the trump administration’s point man on tax reform, financial deregulation and economic diplomacy efforts. a u.s. federal judge rejects a justice department request to suspend seattle courtroom proceedings over trump’s temporary travel ban from seven muslim majority countries until an appeals court has fully reviewed it. benjamin netanyahu opposes a palestinian state, a senior israeli cabinet member says, but leaves it unclear whether the prime minister would say that publicly in talks with trump in washington this week. trump says north korea is a “big, big problem” and that he will deal with it “very strongly” after that country said it successfully test fired a new type of ballistic missile. japanese prime minister shinzo abe, fresh from a visit with trump, says the u.s. stance toward north korea is likely to become tougher. china’s foreign ministry is concerned that japan has received continued u.s. backing for its dispute with beijing over islands in the east china sea during a meeting between trump and abe. a congressional tax oversight committee will not seek trump’s tax returns, despite calls from democrats for a review to determine possible business ties to foreign countries including russia, the panel’s republican chairman says. u.s. equity indexes hit record highs, with the benchmark s&p 500’s market value topping $20 trillion as investors bet tax cuts promised by trump will boost the economy.   the kremlin says there is talk of a possible meeting between trump and president vladimir putin before a g20 summit in july, but there is nothing specific on this so far.

" top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass a tax code overhaul this week, with a senate vote as early as tuesday and president donald trump aiming to sign the bill by week’s end. john cornyn, the no. 2 u.s. senate republican, said in an interview on abc’s “this week” that he was “confident” the senate would pass the legislation, “probably on tuesday.” republican representative kevin brady said he believed his party had the votes to pass the bill. “i think we are headed   the american people are headed    for a big win on tuesday,” brady, the house of representatives’  top tax writer, said on fox news’ “sunday morning futures with maria bartiromo.” “we’ve worked hard to make sure that those strange senate rules don’t hang this up in any way,” brady added. “i am confident that’s the case.”  if passed, the bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986 and provide republican lawmakers and trump with their first major legislative victory since they took control of the white house in january in addition to congress. republicans have a slim 52 48 senate majority and cannot lose more than two votes and still pass tax legislation. democrats are unified against the measure, calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit.  last week, on the fence republican senators marco rubio and bob corker said they would support the tax overhaul. senators susan collins and mike lee put out positive statements but did not explicitly say they would vote for it. collins’ office said on sunday that “she’s still reviewing the bill.” republican senator jeff flake cast a vote for an earlier senate version despite deficit concerns, but he is undecided on the final legislation, his office said on sunday.  senators thad cochran and john mccain have been ill in recent weeks and have missed votes. cochran’s office said last week he was expected to vote on the tax bill. mccain, who is battling an aggressive brain tumor, has returned to his home state of arizona and does not expect to be back in washington until january, his office said on sunday. the tax bill is expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion u.s. national debt over 10 years, even after accounting for the economic growth it might spur, according to independent government analyses.  the bill would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and create a 20 percent income tax deduction for owners of “pass through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. it would offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions. the bill would maintain seven individual and family income tax brackets but cut rates. highest earning americans would pay 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent.  most individual provisions, including the lower tax rates, are temporary and would expire, while the corporate rate cut and other business provisions would be permanent. stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations, with wall street’s three major equities indexes closing at record highs on friday. treasury secretary steven mnuchin told cbs news’ “face the nation” on sunday that trump expected to realize his goal of signing the tax bill before christmas. “this is a historic event,” mnuchin said. “people said we wouldn’t get this done; we’re on the verge of getting this done.”  ",0
" more than 40 lawmakers urged the trump administration on wednesday to reimpose u.s. travel bans on myanmar’s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for a crackdown on the country’s rohingya muslim minority. in a letter sent to u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, a group of republican and democratic members of the house of representatives called for “meaningful steps” against myanmar’s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 rohingya muslims out of the southeast asian nation. “burma’s authorities appear to be in denial of what has happened,” stated the letter. “we urge you to do everything possible to ensure protection and security for those trapped inside burma or willing to return, as well as oppose forcible returns from neighboring countries.” ",0
"sheikh, egypt (reuters)   egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi said on wednesday he was against military strikes on iran or the tehran backed lebanese group hezbollah, saying there was enough turmoil in the middle east. in a meeting with a group of journalists, sisi also pledged support for saudi arabia in its stand off with iran. asked about the prospect of attacks on iran and hezbollah    two days after saudi arabia had accused lebanon of declaring war because of hezbollah s  aggressive actions , sisi stressed the importance of de escalation.  i am always against war,  sisi said, without spelling out who might be involved in military action. sunni powerhouse saudi arabia called for sanctions against hezbollah this week and accused iran of supplying yemen s houthis with missiles used to target it.  i have said it once and i will say it again, gulf national security is egyptian national security. i have faith in the wise and firm leadership of saudi arabia,  sisi said. sisi said the situation in the kingdom was  reassuring and stable  following last weekend s arrests of 11 princes, former and current ministers, and a group of elite businessmen on  corruption allegations.  they face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain. sisi stressed his backing of saudi arabia and other gulf arab states, which have showered egypt with aid ever since the general turned president led the military s ouster of former president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests. lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between saudi arabia and iran since the saudi allied lebanese politician saad al hariri quit as prime minister on saturday, blaming iran and hezbollah in his resignation speech. hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the lebanese parliament and in the hariri led coalition government formed last year. its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring syria, another theater of saudi iranian rivalry where hezbollah has fought in support of the syrian government. sisi was elected a year after he ousted mursi and his first four year term ends next year. he would not be drawn on when he would announce a re election bid, although he is widely expected to run and win. he hinted at doing so by february.  i have to present achievements over the past four years to egyptians first, before saying whether i will run or not. i will do this over the next two months, december and january, and based on their response i will reach a position on running.  one candidate has already declared his intention to challenge sisi. rights lawyer khaled ali announced his 2018 bid on monday in a speech criticizing sisi s administration; accusing it of suppressing freedoms and causing deteriorating economic and security conditions. egypt s economy has been struggling to recover since a 2011 uprising scared away tourists and investors, two main sources of foreign currency, but a three year international monetary fund program is expected to help restore confidence. the imf program is tied to harsh reforms, chief of which was the central bank s decision to float the pound currency last year, which halved its value from 8.8 to the dollar to almost 18. sisi said on wednesday he expected the pound to rally in the near future.  i expect that the exchange rate will strengthen in the coming period, because all the problems that created the crisis over the past few years before the float, i believe, have been solved,  he said. tourism, a major source of hard currency, took a massive hit in 2015 when russia suspended flights to egypt, after islamic state blew a plane out of the air that took off from sharm al sheikh, the red sea resort in which sisi was speaking on wednesday, killing all 224 people, mostly russians, on board. sisi said he was not pressing the russian government to restore flights because he understood its need to protect its citizens.  i have never, and will never, insist on the restoration of flights,  he said. he said security forces were making significant gains against militants, however. the military had captured a foreign fighter in a raid it carried out against militants responsible for a deadly attack on a police convoy in egypt s western desert last month, he said. three security sources said at the time that at least 52 police officers and conscripts were killed on oct. 21 when their patrol came under attack, but the interior ministry rebutted the figure the next day and said only 16 policemen had been killed. a new militant group with links to al qaeda claimed responsibility for attack last week. the foreign militant is the sole survivor of the raid and his confession would be revealed to the public soon, sisi said. the western desert, which spans egypt s more than 1,200 kilometre (745 miles) border with libya, is a new battlefront for security forces, who have been fighting islamic state militants in the sinai peninsula since 2013. sisi did not specify the fighter s nationality but the porous border with libya has been used to smuggle people and weapons regularly. when asked about his support for khalifa haftar, the eastern libyan commander whose libyan national army has been fighting islamist militant groups and other fighters in benghazi and derna for more than two years, sisi said it did not mean he opposed the u.n. backed tripoli based government, even though haftar and his supporters reject it.  our support for haftar is in line with the constants of egyptian policy; we support a political solution and our backing of haftar is not at the expense of fayez seraj s government.

" members of the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) party elected a right wing nationalist to be their co leader on saturday, signaling a possible toughening of tone before regional votes next year. a party congress chose alexander gauland   who once defended an afd member who had said history should be rewritten to focus on german victims of world war two   to return to the post he had held until 2015. as members deliberated, thousands of anti afd protesters marched outside carrying placards reading  hanover against nazis  and  stand up to racism . earlier, riot police fired water cannon at dozens of protesters who blocked a road leading to the congress, underlining the divisive impact the party has had since it entered the bundestag lower house for the first time in a sept. 24 election. the party s incumbent leader jorg meuthen   seen as a relative moderate in the movement   won enough votes to keep his post. but in a vote that dragged into the evening, he was joined as co leader by gauland, who ran for the post at the last minute after another candidate seen as a moderate, georg pazderski, failed to win enough votes. before the leadership vote, meuthen praised the party often beset by internal strife for showing unity after two senior members quit in september in protest against what they saw as an unstoppable populist streak.  there are people in this country who don t only say  we can do this  but who actually manage to do something,  meuthen told delegates, putting a new twist on chancellor angela merkel s  wir schaffen das  (we can do it) message to those who doubted germany can deal with a record influx of migrants in 2015. as thousands of protesters marched peacefully outside, afd delegates watched a short film that painted a gloomy picture of europe s largest economy being overrun by beggars, stone throwers and muslims. founded in 2013 as a vehicle to oppose euro zone bailouts, the afd was polling at around 3 percent nationally two years ago on the eve of the refugee crisis. the arrival of more than 1.6 million people seeking asylum in the two years to the end of 2016 has helped it morph into an anti immigrant party that now has seats in 14 of germany s 16 regional parliament. polls suggest it will win seats in next year s regional elections in the southern state of bavaria and the western region of hesse, which would give it a foothold in all of germany s state parliaments. gauland replaces frauke petry, who quit to become an independent member of parliament. her sudden departure two days after the afd became the first far right party to win seats in the bundestag since the 1950s exposed rifts over whether the party should ditch rhetoric including statements saying islam was not compatible with the german constitution.

" liberia s president ellen johnson sirleaf on tuesday said democracy in the west african country was being threatened, a day after the supreme court put a presidential runoff on hold over fraud allegations. former footballer george weah was initially set to face vice president joseph boakai on tuesday to determine who will replace the term limited nobel peace prize laureate.  a successful vote would be liberia s first democratic transfer of power in more than seven decades. but on monday, the supreme court ordered the elections commission to fully examine allegations levelled by charles brumskine, who finished third in last month s first round poll. the ruling could push back the run off date by weeks or even result in the first round being re run.  democracy is only as strong as its weakest link and at these moments, our democracy is under assault. our country s reputation is under assault, our economy is under stress,  johnson sirleaf said in a radio address. the national elections commission (nec) has said the first round of voting was largely fair, and international observers said they saw no major problems with the poll. however brumskine s complaint cites gross irregularities and accuses nec officials of fraud, an allegation the body denies. a growing chorus of parties have voiced support for brumskine s case, including boakai s ruling unity party, which last week accused johnson sirleaf, one of its own members, of trying to influence the vote. she rejected the accusation.  allegations, hate speech, inciteful language has been defining what should be a proud moment in our history,  she said on tuesday.  we politicians must do better ... historians will look back at this time and judge us by how we conduct ourselves at this critical moment in time.  boakai, brumskine and two other first round candidates   alexander cummings and benoni urey   held a meeting in the capital monrovia on tuesday. while they called upon their supporters to remain calm and pledged to respect the law, they also vowed to fight to ensure the credibility of the vote.  we thought this would be peaceful, transparent, and meet the standard that it would bring dignity to our country,  boakai said afterward.  unfortunately the process was peaceful but not transparent, not credible and didn t represent the will of the liberian people.

" donald trump campaigned for president as a savvy billionaire who would apply his business acumen to improving the u.s. economy, cutting taxes for americans and negotiating better trade deals. but his vast, complicated network of businesses under the trump organization, including numerous foreign investments and debts, could create unprecedented conflicts of interest when he takes the oath of office as u.s. president in january, government ethics experts said.  federal law does not prohibit the president from being involved in private business while in office, even though members of congress and lower ranking executive branch officials are subject to strict conflict of interest rules. lyndon johnson, for instance, quietly managed his broadcasting businesses despite insisting publicly that he had ceased all involvement, according to his biographer, robert caro. “there are no legal restrictions, no legal requirements,” said noah bookbinder, the executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington. but most presidents in recent decades have voluntarily placed their personal assets, including property and financial holdings, in blind trusts overseen by independent advisers to avoid any appearance of impropriety, experts said. under a blind trust, the owner has no say or knowledge in how the assets are managed. president barack obama was one exception, but his investments are mostly in broad based index funds and u.s. treasury notes with little chance of conflicts. trump’s businesses include licensing deals, hotels and golf courses around the world. during the campaign, he filed a 104 page financial disclosure statement, as required by law, that showed he had financial interests in more than 500 entities with names like china trademark llc and dt marks qatar llc but had few details. while plenty of wealthy men have been president, no one has ascended to the white house with such a complex array of assets. trump’s spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how he planned to manage his businesses while he was in the white house. during the campaign, trump did say he would likely transfer day to day operations to his children. but experts in government ethics said that would do little to insulate trump. “that presumably frees some time up for him to be the president, but it doesn’t do anything to clear the conflicts of interest,” said kenneth gross, a washington, d.c. based lawyer who has counseled high ranking political appointees on ethics laws. “his family’s interests, his children’s interests, are co existent with his own.” the nature of trump’s businesses, gross said, makes a blind trust all but meaningless – even if he were inclined to shift control of his empire from his family, an idea he has rejected. gross advised michael bloomberg, a new york billionaire businessman, when he became mayor of new york city. bloomberg stepped away from day to day operations at his data and media company, bloomberg lp, and donated all terminals that were used by city agencies to avoid any impression of profiting from public funds. some of the potential problems for the republican president elect are obvious. one of his latest ventures, a luxury hotel in washington just blocks from the white house, leases its property from the u.s. government, putting trump on both sides of any landlord tenant disputes. others are more opaque. trump has licensing deals and diverse real estate holdings in numerous countries that could benefit from foreign government subsidies or tax breaks. companies in which he holds an interest owe hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to foreign banks that are subject to u.s. regulations, such as deutsche bank and bank of china, according to the new york times and the wall street journal. his properties include hotels in countries like turkey, uruguay, the philippines and south korea, and golf courses in the united arab emirates, ireland and britain.   conflicts of interest could stem, for example, from countries trying to influence policies by doing business with any of his companies or even his children. his daughter ivanka has a line of fashion products, which along with other trump branded items are made in countries like china. trump has accused china of currency manipulation and threatened to put tariffs on its imports. trump’s opponent, democratic nominee hillary clinton, faced criticism during the campaign over the clinton foundation, the charity founded by her husband, former president bill clinton. that was despite an ethics agreement that hillary clinton signed in 2009 in order to become obama’s secretary state that was designed to ensure donors could not sway u.s. foreign policy. under the deal, the state department was allowed to review any new contributions from foreign governments. unlike clinton, however, trump is not answerable to anyone else as president. and he has already shown himself willing to blur the lines between campaigning and marketing, holding events at his own properties and touting his companies during speeches.  given the high profile properties that bear his name, a blind trust would do little to help his case, experts said. “you can’t put a golf course in a blind trust; it would be pointless,” said robert kelner, a washington lawyer and an expert on government ethics. “the idea behind a blind trust is that it’s blind – you don’t know what assets are held.” the only unassailable solution, experts said, would be for trump to sell off his businesses and place the proceeds in a blind trust. with no legal requirements, trump’s actions as president are only subject to the will of the voters or to built in checks and balances like congressional oversight.  the potential for conflicts is exacerbated by the lack of publicly known details about trump’s holdings. even his net worth is unclear. trump has boasted of more than $10 billion in wealth, but financial magazines have estimated his fortune at less than half that. he has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition, and legal experts said he is under no obligation to do so as president. his dealings with foreign governments are thus largely unknown. he will likely face scrutiny of policy decisions that affect countries where he is known to have business interests, said bookbinder.

" three competing plans for battling a potential zika virus outbreak in the united states were presented on the floor of the u.s. senate on thursday, as lawmakers tried to break an impasse pitting president barack obama against congressional republicans. the first test votes on the measures, which would provide at least $1.1 billion in new funds to deal with the spreading virus, were expected on tuesday. in february, obama urged congress to quickly approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with prevention and treatment of zika virus, which the world health organization warns is spreading rapidly in the americas. the disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities. it also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, guillain barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis. white house spokesman josh earnest welcomed “any sort of forward momentum in congress” while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion. “it could not be clearer that congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the zika virus. that is critical for health and safety of the american people,” earnest said. florida’s senators, bill nelson, a democrat, and marco rubio, a republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate. they noted that the florida department of health has reported a total of 112 zika virus cases, the most of any u.s. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.   one proposal now before the senate would provide obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. a second one would scale back obama’s request to $1.1 billion. these two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the zika costs, senate aides said. a third one would take money from obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in zika response funds. even if the senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the house of representatives, where republicans are deeply divided over new zika funding, according to aides. two senior republican aides said the party’s house leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over donald trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over puerto rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the house. while plans to unveil a new puerto rico bill on wednesday were canceled, a third senior house republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that “discussions” on a budget “are moving forward as well.”    senate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the senate started debating on thursday.

" two boston brothers accused of urinating on and beating a homeless mexican man and telling police “donald trump was right: all these illegals need to be deported,” were sentenced to prison on monday, prosecutors said. scott leader, 38, and steve leader, 30, had previously pleaded guilty to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among other charges. scott leader was sentenced to three years in prison and steve leader was sentenced to 1 1/2 years, the suffolk county district attorney’s office said in a statement. the pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end. the leaders were arrested on aug. 19 on suspicion of beating rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. the men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant.  the victim, guillermo rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident. “i came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. i actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if i had been undocumented i still would not have deserved to be beaten this way,” rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by assistant district attorney nicole rimar before the sentencing. the pair punched and kicked rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said. according to a police report, they told officers, “donald trump was right: all these illegals need to be deported.” prosecutors said scott leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and hispanic. the pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody. trump, the presumptive republican nominee for the u.s. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the united states. trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration but later called it “terrible.” lawyers for the two men could not be reached for immediate comment on monday night.

" the wave of refugees that entered germany in 2015 2016 has slowed its integration efforts, according to a study that also showed little progress since 2005 in leveling the playing field for immigrants on education, employment and incomes. at the height of europe s migration crisis, chancellor angela merkel adopted an open borders policy that drew more than one million refugees into germany in two years. in the prior decade, education opportunities picked up for newly arrived immigrants and people born in germany with at least one foreign parent. but the federal statistics office study released on thursday found the education gap between those categories of migrants and native germans had since widened again, with the proportion of the former lacking a high school certificate growing between 2014 and 2016. the scale of future immigration has become a major sticking point in three party talks that merkel is leading on the formation of a new coalition government, for which she has set an initial deadline of thursday night. while germany s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the country s reunification in 1990, more immigrants were unemployed in 2016 than native germans, the study said. in that year, 13.6 percent of immigrants and 6.2 percent of native germans had low paying jobs. merkel s conservatives have proposed to the coalition talks that a suspension of reunifications between migrants and their family members outside germany should be extended beyond a march 2018 deadline. immigration expert herbert bruecker, a professor at the berlin integration and migration institute, said that would worsen the divide.   our surveys show that people, who are living separated from their families, have a lower life satisfaction and also suffer more often from depression or bitterness,  he said.

" the u.n. security council could vote as early as wednesday on a push by the united states, britain and france to bolster support for international inquiries into a deadly toxic gas attack in syria, diplomats said, a move russia had deemed unacceptable and unwarranted. the three countries have proposed a revised draft resolution, diplomats said, similar to a text they circulated to the 15 member council last week that condemns the april 4 attack and pushes syria’s government to cooperate with investigators. western powers blame the sarin gas attack, which killed scores of civilians   many of them children, on syrian president bashar al assad’s forces.  syria’s government has denied responsibility for the attack, which prompted a u.s. strike on a syrian air base. the security council vote would come at the end of a visit to moscow by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson. a senior security council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the most likely scenario appeared to be a veto of the u.n. resolution by syrian ally russia. russia said last week the draft resolution was unacceptable and unwarranted.  the senior diplomat said that last week the chinese had been prepared to abstain in a vote. russia is one of five council veto powers, along with china, the united states, britain and france. “we cannot give up and we must try in good faith, the best we can, to have a text of the security council condemning the attack, asking for a thorough investigation,” french u.n. ambassador francois delattre told reporters on tuesday. an organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw) fact finding mission is already investigating the attack in the town of khan sheikhoun in a rebel held area of northern syria. if they determine chemical weapons were used, then a joint u.n./opcw investigation will look at the incident to determine who is to blame. this team has already found syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and islamic state militants used mustard gas. in february, syrian ally russia, backed by china, cast its seventh veto to protect assad’s government from council action, blocking a bid by western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks. china has vetoed six resolutions on syria.

" representative jeb hensarling, the republican chairman of the u.s. house of representatives financial services committee, announced on tuesday that he would retire from congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of congress’s leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. hensarling, 60, of texas, said in a statement that he would not seek re election, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. he has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. “today i am announcing that i will not seek re election to the u.s. congress in 2018,” hensarling said in a statement. “although service in congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, i never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and i have already stayed far longer than i had originally planned.” hensarling, first elected to congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law. the overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 2007 2009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. that bill, the financial choice act, is not expected to become law after passing the house, due to insufficient support in the senate. but his work was hailed by gop colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. “jeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal dodd frank and deliver a freer market that gives every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream,” said house majority leader kevin mccarthy in a statement. banking lobby groups, including the financial services roundtable and american bankers association, said hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. he has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. but those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put americans at risk of a similar meltdown. “hensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. we hope the revolving door doesn’t hit him too hard on the way out,” said karl frisch, executive director of allied progress. while some gop lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill re election battles, hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in texas where he remains highly popular. in 2016, he faced no republican rivals in the party’s primary and took 80.6 percent of the district’s vote in the general election. even though the district consistently votes republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the house in 2018. lawyer dan wood, has already entered the race to be the party’s nominee for the seat. unlike some exiting republicans, hensarling never publicly feuded with president donald trump. in fact, trump had considered hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. his exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. representative patrick mchenry is the vice chair of the committee, but representatives blaine luetkemeyer, bill huizenga, and sean duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. one lobbyist said luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as mchenry is seen as a rising star in house leadership. luetkemeyer is “seriously considering” running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. hensarling’s next move is unclear. some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the heritage foundation. alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. cowen and co analyst jaret seiberg said in a client note that hensarling could be “the top contender” to take over the federal housing finance agency, which regulates fannie mae and freddie mac. the current fhfa director, mel watt, is an appointee of former president barack obama, serving out a term that expires in january of 2019.

" later this year, angela merkel may form a new government with a party whose leader says greece should leave the euro, russia can keep crimea and refugees will have to go home. the free democrats (fdp), a socially liberal, pro business party, were long seen as the natural partners of chancellor merkel s conservatives. they ruled in coalition with her mentor, former chancellor helmut kohl, for 16 years and were junior partners in merkel s second government, from 2009 to 2013.  but after crashing out of the german parliament four years ago, the fdp   also known as the liberals   were forced to reinvent themselves. and the new incarnation, led by an ambitious 38 year old who preaches an ultra hard line on europe, has unsettled the german political establishment, including members of merkel s party.  nevertheless, if her conservatives can form a government with the fdp after a sept. 24 election, merkel will have little choice but to link up with the party and its young leader christian lindner. (for a graphic on german federal elections click tmsnrt.rs/2h0nqct)  for her center right cdu/csu, the prospect of reviving an alliance with the party s historic partner will be hard to resist, especially after four years of a right left coalition with their longtime rivals, the social democrats (spd).   merkel s horror scenario is a narrow majority with the fdp,  said frank decker, a political scientist who was lindner s thesis adviser at bonn university.  she would have no choice. she would be condemned to govern with them.  polls give merkel s cdu/csu bloc and the fdp a combined score of roughly 45 percent, just shy of a majority. if they do fall short, the fdp could still enter the government as part of an unwieldy three way coalition that also includes the greens. in 2013, after its former leader guido westerwelle failed to deliver on his promise of tax cuts, the party scored just 4.8 percent, the first time in the post war era it failed to make the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. later this month, it is expected to double its score of four years ago. lindner, with his banker suits and designer stubble, has almost single handedly hauled the fdp back from the political wilderness. german media have likened him to french president emmanuel macron: the two are just a year apart in age and share a healthy self esteem. in the fdp s highly personalized campaign posters, a brooding lindner is shown in black and white, staring off camera, like a model from a 1990s calvin klein ad. look beneath the surface however, and there are big differences between lindner and macron. the french leader is promising to work with the next german government on an overhaul of the euro zone, introducing a budget and finance minister for the currency bloc. lindner has dismissed those ideas with an aggressiveness that has surprised even some of his closest allies. if one takes lindner and the fdp s campaign manifesto at face value, the party would introduce automatic sanctions for countries that violate eu budget rules, do away with the euro zone s bailout fund and make it easier for countries to leave the currency. greece is a favorite target. two weeks ago, lindner told a banking conference in frankfurt that a reintroduction of the drachma would be a boon for the country.  all those who vacation in mallorca would go to the greek islands instead,  he said. martin lueck, an investment strategist at blackrock, sees a risk that the euro crisis could return, with italian borrowing costs spiraling higher, if the fdp makes it into government. fdp officials play down such risks, pointing to moderating  influences in the party like members of the european parliament alexander graf lambsdorff and michael theurer.  our program is about direction. it shows what we would do if we were able to govern alone, which of course won t be possible,  one senior official said. but aides to merkel acknowledge that she would probably be more limited in what she could achieve with macron if the fdp were a partner, particularly if lindner became finance minister.  he could make our european partners nostalgic for wolfgang schaeuble,  one aide quipped, referring to merkel s current finance minister, who is seen as a hardliner himself. if the fdp were to end up in a three way coalition with the greens, its more radical ideas would surely be blunted. that is why some members of merkel s party say she would prefer a  jamaica  coalition   so named because the colors of the parties would match those of the green, yellow and black jamaican flag   to a two way alliance with the fdp. in the final stretch, lindner has floated an array of controversial ideas in an apparent attempt to lure voters from the hard right alternative for germany (afd) party. last month, he recommended accepting russia s 2014 annexation of the crimea region of ukraine as a  permanent provisional arrangement . last week, he said refugees should be forced to go home as soon as peace returned to the middle east countries from which they fled.  even fdp members say they have trouble discerning how much of this is mere pre election posturing. as the party s identity has become intertwined with its leader lindner, its core beliefs have become muddied. the picture may become clearer on sunday, when the fdp is due to unveil a l0 point list of policy priorities. expect a modern twist on classic fdp positions   tax cuts, investments in broadband and a canada style immigration law making it easier to bring in skilled workers   that are closer to those of other european liberals like macron. regardless, the fdp faces a steep learning curve if it makes the leap from outside parliament into government   a feat no party has achieved since the 1950s. two thirds of the fdp candidates who could win bundestag seats have never worked there before. only one has cabinet level experience in berlin.  we ll see whether they have learned the lessons of the past,  said decker.  westerwelle was a great opposition leader but struggled in government. lindner must avoid the same fate.

" the u.s. senate foreign relations committee voted 12 9 on thursday to approve president donald trump’s nominee as ambassador to israel, david friedman, an outspoken bankruptcy lawyer aligned with the israeli right. the vote was largely along party lines, a contrast with  strong bipartisan support for past ambassadors to israel. democratic senator robert menendez joined all 11 committee republicans in backing friedman, despite concerns about his temperament. friedman, who has no diplomatic experience, is a long time friend of trump who has worked for the new york businessman as a bankruptcy lawyer.  in addition to investing in settlements on land claimed by the palestinians, friedman favors moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem. the relocation is strongly opposed by many u.s. allies because both israel and the palestinians claim the city as their capital. trump’s selection of friedman reflects his shift in policy toward israel after years of friction between former president barack obama and israeli leader benjamin netanyahu. unlike obama, trump has wavered on the u.s. commitment to a two state solution, long a bedrock of washington’s middle east policy, and backed the embassy’s relocation. friedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements. democrats said his approach could risk security. “the region is incredibly volatile. the last thing we need in this position is someone who has a penchant for over the top, hyperbolic, and even false statements,” democratic senator tim kaine said. friedman has called obama an anti semite, and dismissed the liberal leaning pro israel group j street as “far worse than kapos,” a reference to jews who worked for the nazis in world war two concentration camps. j street and the reform jewish movement are among groups opposing friedman’s nomination. friedman was heckled during his contentious february confirmation hearing. he said then that he regretted the use of such language. senator ben cardin, the committee’s ranking democrat, said friedman also was problematic because he does not explicitly back a two state solution for middle east peace. friedman will next be considered by the full senate, where trump’s fellow republicans control a slim majority. he is expected to be confirmed despite continued democratic opposition. republican senator bob corker, the foreign relations committee chairman, praised friedman as an “impassioned advocate” for strong u.s. israeli ties. “he understands the complexity of issues at stake for the united states and the necessity to support a democratic ally in an important and unstable part of the world,” corker said.

" the german defence ministry said on monday that the european fighter jet was the leading candidate to replace its tornado jets, which it wants to start phasing out in 2025. the ministry s position appears to contradict that of the german air force, whose chief indicated last month that he preferred lockheed martin s f 35, which meets the military s requirements of stealth and long distance operational capabilities. in a letter to a greens lawmaker who had inquired about the deliberations, the ministry said the f 35 and boeing s f 15 and f 18 fighters were secondary options.  the indicated view of the inspector of the air force that the f 35 lightning ii is an especially suitable successor to the tornado system is not the position of the federal government,  deputy defence minister ralf brauksiepe wrote in the letter. the eurofighter typhoon is a joint project between british defense group bae, france s airbus and italy s finmeccanica. the ministry s preference for the typhoon is no surprise; france and germany said earlier this year they would work together to develop a new european fighter, as they expand cooperation on defense and security [nl8n1k43js]. many german allies in europe, including norway, the netherlands, britain, italy, turkey and denmark have selected the f 35 and some have received initial deliveries. belgium is expected to make a decision next year. the contract to replace germany s 85 tornado jets, which go out of service around 2030, could be worth billions of euros. a new fighter purchase would have to be approved by parliament in the next two years and a contract signed by 2020 or 2021 to ensure deliveries by 2025. no final decision is likely before a new government is formed, following elections this past september. chancellor angela merkel will open talks on wednesday with the social democrats (spd) on renewing their alliance, which has ruled germany since 2013. she turned to the spd after efforts to form a coalition with the environmentalist greens and the pro business free democrats failed.

" financial advisers and accountants are working overtime as many u.s. taxpayers scramble to pay the rest of their 2017 taxes before jan. 1 when the proposed republican tax overhaul would sharply cut the amount they can deduct on federal tax bills.  the tax legislation, which top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass this week, caps the amount of state, local and property taxes individuals can deduct from their federal tax bills at $10,000. the average american who itemized his or her tax bill in 2015 claimed more than $27,000 in deductions. while taxpayers have until jan. 15 to pay the final installment of their 2017 taxes, tom holly of the accounting firm pwc said he received dozens of calls over the weekend from concerned clients eager to pay sooner.  “it’s going to be a very busy holiday season for advisers,” said holly, who heads the firm’s wealth and asset management division.  lisa featherngill, managing director of wealth planning at wells fargo’s abbot downing, said she was skipping a family trip to the valero alamo bowl football game in texas on dec. 28 in order to work. featherngill said wealthy clients and their accountants were not just trying to figure out if it makes sense to estimate and  pay the rest of their 2017 itemized taxes this year, but also working to see if they should itemize at all.  some taxpayers, particularly those in high tax states who have income above $100,000, may end up paying the alternative minimum tax, which limits the deductions a person can take against his or her federal income tax. “people really have to run the numbers because ... if they are subject to alternative minimum tax, some of those taxes wouldn’t be deductible anyway,” said featherngill. last week, according to media reports, state officials in new york received calls from residents asking to pay their 2018 state, local and property taxes before jan. 1 in an effort to claim the higher amount of deductions before the republican tax bill takes effect.  in response, the u.s. treasury department issued guidance over the weekend saying that any pre payments for 2018 tax liabilities would not be deductible on federal tax bills. if passed, the tax bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986. the legislation would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent but offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions.

" i am a student of history so i tend to actually be familiar with many of these episodes that have been mentioned. i am the first one to acknowledge that america s application to concern around human rights has not always been consistent. and, i m certainly mindful that there are dark chapters in our own history in which we have not always observed the principles and ideals upon which the country was founded. just a few weeks ago i was in selma, alabama celebrating the 50th anniversary of a march across a bridge that resulted in horrific violence and the reason i was there and the reason it was a celebration is because it was a triumph of human spirit in which ordinary people without resort to violence were able to overcome systematic segregation. there voices were heard and our country changed. america never makes a claim about being perfect, we do make a claim about being open to change.

" u.s. senate democrats plan to fight some of president elect donald trump’s choices for top administration jobs, but history and the party’s minority status in the chamber are not on their side. a simple majority of 51 votes is needed in the 100 member senate to confirm nominations. louisiana will select its newest senator on saturday. if the republicans, as expected, hold on to the seat, they will control at least 52 seats in the chamber next year. senate republicans said on thursday they were confident of winning cabinet confirmations early next year. nonetheless, some democrats said they hoped to persuade a few republicans to help them block a trump nominee or two, following the republican trump’s inauguration on jan. 20, when a newly installed senate starts reviewing his nominations. that could be just brave talk from democrats. the senate has rejected only nine of 719 cabinet nominations in u.s. history, not counting nominees who have withdrawn when facing certain defeat, according to congressional records. the last rejection was in 1989, when the senate blocked republican president george h.w. bush’s nomination of senator john tower to be defense secretary. in 2013, democratic president barack obama had trouble getting chuck hagel confirmed as defense secretary, but he ultimately prevailed. this time around, democrats said their top targets included  u.s. representative tom price as head of the department of health and human services, and oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt as environmental protection agency administrator. former new york investment banker and hedge fund investor steven mnuchin, tapped by trump to become treasury secretary, is also drawing the ire of democrats, who will be in the minority in both the new senate and house of representatives in 2017. trump’s path toward senate confirmations of nominees will be easier than the one faced by most of his predecessors. in 2013, senate democrats, frustrated by republicans blocking obama’s choices for federal judges, used their majority status at the time to eliminate “filibusters” against executive and judicial branch nominations, except the supreme court. that meant only 51 votes were needed for confirmations, rather than 60. pruitt is a climate change skeptic who has participated in lawsuits trying to stop the epa from carrying out clean air regulations. as a nominee, he will embody “the fossil fuel and anti clean air and clean water movement. ... i like those odds,” democratic senator edward markey said of the fight ahead. in 2009, when in the house, markey was a leader in the fight for legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. republican senator lindsey graham, who was an ally at the time in that failed battle, said in a brief interview that while he did not know pruitt: “i appreciate his passion for fighting back against things he thought were an overreach” by federal agencies. price is high on the democrats’ target list, according to a senior senate democratic aide, who asked not to be identified,  defending medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly, is a top priority of congressional democrats. price supports limiting some medicare benefits. he also opposes government funding for women’s healthcare provider planned parenthood. that could help democrats win support for blocking price from moderate republicans such as susan collins or lisa murkowski, the senior aide said. a spokeswoman for murkowski said she had not expressed an opinion on the price nomination. collins and her aides were not immediately available for comment. a second senior senate democratic aide said some republicans up for re election in 2018 could be uncomfortable voting for price because of his medicare stance. but graham said price “has been the heart and soul of the republican alternative to obamacare. i can’t imagine any republican voting against him.” republican senator jeff sessions has been chosen by trump to be attorney general. democrats plan to highlight his hardline stances on illegal immigration, as well as remind colleagues that a republican controlled senate judiciary committee rejected sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations that he had made racist remarks, which he denied. if the debate stokes strong opposition to sessions,   republicans might have to scramble to win his confirmation. that could especially be true if the alabama lawmaker follows a long held practice of senators of merely voting “present” on their own confirmations, meaning democrats would be one vote closer to defeating him.

" european parliament president martin schulz on wednesday said he hoped for a “rational cooperation” with donald trump as the next u.s. president after a bitter political campaign.  “it will not be easy because during the election campaign we heard some elements of protectionism, also some worrying words about women, about minorities,” said schulz, a german social democrat. “but my experience is also that election campaigns are different from the real politics during a term of the president so i hope that we will get back to a rational cooperation,” he said in televised remarks. in a separate written statement, he highlighted need for trump to formulate more detailed policies after a campaign that capitalized on voters’ discontent with the status quo and he also listed key international policies that could be affected by the change of administration in washington. “mr. trump has managed to become the standard bearer of the angst and fears of millions of americans. those concerns must now be addressed with credible policies,” schulz said. “vitriol and polarization have fueled this electoral contest. president trump will have the daunting task of bringing together a divided nation. “from syria to iraq, from ukraine to libya, trump’s role in diplomacy and dealmaking will be tested from day one,” he added. “from the fight against global warming to its commitment to nato, the world awaits and hopes for an outward looking presidency aiming at shaping international relations and upholding the values of freedom and democracy.” ",0
" two leading critics of president barack obama’s moves toward normal relations with cuba introduced legislation on wednesday seeking to temporarily halt commercial flights between the united states and the island because of security concerns. republican senator marco rubio and democratic senator robert menendez, both cuban american opponents of obama’s cuba policy, introduced the cuban airport security act. the measure would stop commercial flights until after a study of security measures and equipment at airports in cuba. the u.s. government has granted several u.s. airlines permission to begin scheduled flights to cuba, opening another chapter in the obama administration’s efforts to improve ties and increase trade and travel with the former cold war foe. a jetblue airways corp passenger jet flew to santa clara, cuba, from fort lauderdale, florida, on aug. 31. it was the first scheduled commercial passenger flight from the united states to cuba in more than half a century. commercial flights to the capital, havana, are expected to begin later this year. obama’s cuba policy sharply divides the u.s. congress.  opponents, mostly republicans but also a few democrats, say he is moving too quickly to ease restrictions on travel and trade, given continuing human rights violations by its communist government. backers say it is time to try another tactic in dealing with havana after more than half a century with no change under the previous policy. a version of the bill was introduced in the house of representatives in july. there has been no announcement of when the measure might come up for a vote.

" a florida man pleaded guilty on monday to working with another man to illegally funnel $80,000 in foreign contributions to u.s. president barack obama’s joint fundraising committee in 2012 so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event. william argeros, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court in newark, new jersey, to charges that he knowingly and willfully made foreign contributions and donations and made a false  declaration to a federal grand jury, prosecutors said. u.s. law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals to candidates or fundraising committees in federal elections. a lawyer for argeros did not respond to a request for comment. the tampa, florida, resident is scheduled to be sentenced on nov. 9. the proceedings came a month after an earlier guilty plea in the case by bilal shehu, a new jersey limousine driver to whom prosecutors said argeros facilitated the transferring of $80,000 from a foreign source. prosecutors said shehu, a paramus, new jersey resident, then provided the money to obama’s joint fundraising committee so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event on oct. 8, 2012, in san francisco. in announcing both guilty pleas, prosecutors have not specifically identified the foreign source of the money or the foreign national. but the cases came after a republican congressman in 2013 called for investigations into the purchases by shehu’s family of two $40,000 tickets for a san francisco fundraiser, one of which was used by now albanian prime minister edi rama. at the october 2012 event, rama, the albanian socialist party leader, was photographed with obama. u.s. representative dana rohrabacher of california at the time contended the photo was then used for “deceitful” purposes by rama to imply a relationship with obama during albania’s own election, which brought him into leadership. prosecutors have said that the foreign national in the case was denied entry to the campaign event but was allowed to be photographed with obama. prosecutors said no one on the joint election committee has been accused of any wrongdoing and that it had cooperated fully in the investigation.

" when theresa may visits brussels on friday, eu negotiators will be listening intently for signs the british prime minister is preparing to risk a domestic backlash and raise her offer to secure a brexit deal in december. european union officials and diplomats from the other 27 member states involved in the process hope that within a week to 10 days of meeting european council president donald tusk, during a summit with ex soviet neighbors, may will deliver movement on three key conditions so that her eu peers can launch a new phase of brexit negotiations when they meet on dec. 14 15.  i don t know what room for maneuver may has, but what we can see is a willingness to act,  one senior eu official told reuters. another spoke of efforts to arrange the  choreography  of a deal over the next three weeks, including an eu uk  joint report  pinning down interim accords to unlock talks on trade.  i feel the tectonic plates moving now,  a diplomat handling brexit for an eu government said.  time is running out and a failure in the december council would serve nobody s purpose.  there has been only a day of top level talks between the two lead negotiators since a mid october summit that dismissed may s call for immediate talks on a future trade agreement.  but talks are continuing apace behind the scenes, ahead of a deadline of early december to strike a deal which can then be formalized by the 27 government leaders at the summit.  everyone is talking to everyone already, at all levels,  the european commission s chief spokesman margaritis schinas told reporters on thursday when he confirmed that may would meet commission president jean claude juncker and brexit negotiator michel barnier in brussels on monday, dec. 4. that is two days before envoys from the 27 meet on dec. 6 to discuss a first draft of the dec. 14 15 summit conclusions, including, crucially, whether the leaders should accept britain has made  sufficient progress  to merit opening trade talks.  hopes in brussels have been raised by reports in british media that may has secured backing from pro brexit hardliners in her cabinet to increase the amount of a financial settlement of what britain owes to the union when it leaves in march 2019.   if there is a political willingness in britain, we should be ready,  a senior eu official said, while warning that nothing was being taken for granted.  may s room for maneuver to cut a deal that would please business while irritating britons who want a sharper break with brussels is limited. and germany and france, the union s lead powers, have taken a tough line so far. with german chancellor angela merkel distracted at home by a search for a new coalition, may can expect little focus from her to help smooth a deal, several diplomats said.  some in britain have suggested may could take advantage of merkel s weakness at home to drive a harder bargain. but eu diplomats argue that merkel s troubles make it harder for her, and so for the 27, to water down their existing demands. so any brinkmanship around the summit could mean no deal in december.  that would create some kind of crisis in negotiations,  the second eu official said, noting that time was already short to complete a treaty by late next year to ensure an orderly brexit.  but maybe that is necessary.  the sides already believe they are quite close on agreeing the scope of rights for expatriate citizens in britain and on the continent, though the eu will be particularly looking to pin britain down to accepting its demands that any agreement be subject to enforcement through the union s legal system. the third key criterion for moving to phase two, an outline agreement on how to avoid the new eu uk land border disrupting the peace in northern ireland, remains a potential stumbling block. differences of opinion between london and dublin have been marked this month, worrying eu officials. however, it is the financial settlement that has been the most concerning for the past few months. officials believe that  could be resolved by a combination of may stating clearly that britain will pay a share after leaving of two major eu budget lines, staff pensions and agreed but undisbursed spending. british press reports, seen in brussels as planted leaks from may, suggesting she might offer to pay something like 40 billion pounds ($53 billion) have encouraged eu negotiators.  while that is well short of the 60 billion euros ($71 billion) the european commission has mentioned, that was always seen by eu officials as a maximum demand. and they are willing, they say, to help may massage the public messaging of the amount in order to limit the political flak she takes at home.  on presentational issues, barnier is ready to help, not to call things by their real name,  an eu official said.

" pope francis made one of his most emotional anti war addresses on thursday, saying during a visit to a u.s. military cemetery that the world seemed to be headed into war perhaps bigger than any before. francis said a mass for several thousand people at the sicily rome american cemetery in the town of nettuno, south of the italian capital, on the day roman catholics commemorate their dead.  the burial ground is the final resting place for 7,860 american soldiers who died in the liberation of southern italy and rome in 1943 and 1944. he walked slowly and alone amid the rows of low white headstones in the shape of crosses and stars of david, gently resting a white rose on about a dozen and stopping to pray silently before saying the mass.  please lord, stop. no more wars. no more of these useless massacres,  he said, speaking in hushed tones in an improvised homily. francis said that remembering the many young people who died in world war two was even more important  today that the world once more is at war and is preparing to go even more forcefully into war.  he did not elaborate but appeared to be referring to the possibility of nuclear war. as tensions between the united states and north korea have increased in recent months, francis has warned that a nuclear conflict would destroy a good part of humanity. last april, he said a third country should try to mediate the dispute between pyongyang and washington to cool a situation that had become  too hot . u.s. president donald trump, who has said north korea  will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen  if it threatened the united states, will visit south korea as part of a trip to asia that starts on friday. while trump is in asia, the pope will be hosting an international seminar at the vatican that will urge the banning of nuclear weapons. the cemetery mass was attended by u.s. ambassador to italy lewis eisenberg and the acting u.s. ambassador to the vatican, louis bono.  if today is a day of hope, it is also a day of tears,  the pope said.  humanity must not forget  the tears of mothers and wives who lost husbands and sons in past wars.  humanity has not learned the lesson and seems that it does not want to learn it,  he said, asking for prayers for the victims of today s conflicts, especially children. on his way back to the vatican, francis stopped to pray at the ardeatine caves, where in march, 1944 occupying nazis killed 335 italian men and boys as a reprisal for the killing of 33 german policemen by partisans. they were all shot in the back of the neck. the germans blew up the caves in a vain attempt to try to hide the massacre.     seventy five of the victims were jews. he and rome s chief rabbi, riccardo di segni, each read a prayer. after walking past the tombs in the still dark caves, the pope wrote in the visitors  book:  this is the fruit of war: hate, death, vendetta. forgive us lord .

" a french military strike on armed militants in northern mali last month inadvertently killed malian soldiers who were being held hostage by the islamist group, the west african nation s defence ministry said on monday. the french army has previously said that 15 members of the islamist militant group ansar dine were taken  out of action  in the oct. 23 operation in the abeibara region, which involved mirage jets, attack helicopters and ground forces. in the week following the raid however, malian media reported that 11 soldiers had also been killed. french and malian military and government officials initially declined to comment on the deaths. in a statement dated oct. 31 but only distributed on monday, the defence ministry said that  malian soldiers, detained by the terrorists, died  in the attack without giving a death toll. it was not immediately clear why the distribution of the statement, which was drafted following a meeting between the defense minister, france s ambassador to mali and a french military official, appeared to have been delayed. paris has maintained that military intelligence had identified the site as a militant camp and french army spokesman colonel patrik steiger declined to comment on the malian statement.  work is under way with the malian authorities to determine the identities of individuals killed. it s up to mali, a sovereign country, to communicate on this subject, not the french forces,  he said.  france intervened in 2013 against islamist militants that seized northern mali a year earlier. around 4,000 of its troops remain in west africa s sahel region as part of operation barkhane, a cross border anti terrorism operation.

" from the moment saad al hariri s plane touched down in saudi arabia on friday nov. 3, he was in for a surprise. there was no line up of saudi princes or ministry officials, as would typically greet a prime minister on an official visit to king salman, senior sources close to hariri and top lebanese political and security officials said. his phone was confiscated, and the next day he was forced to resign as prime minister in a statement broadcast by a saudi owned tv channel. the move thrust lebanon back to the forefront of a struggle that is reshaping the middle east, between the conservative sunni monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite revolutionary iran. their rivalry has fueled conflicts in iraq, syria and yemen, where they back opposing sides, and now risks destabilizing lebanon, where saudi has long tried to weaken the iran backed hezbollah group, lebanon s main political power and part of the ruling coalition. sources close to hariri say saudi arabia has concluded that the prime minister   a long time saudi ally and son of late prime minister rafik al hariri, who was assassinated in 2005   had to go because he was unwilling to confront hezbollah. multiple lebanese sources say riyadh hopes to replace saad hariri with his older brother bahaa as lebanon s top sunni politician. bahaa is believed to be in saudi arabia and members of the hariri family have been asked to travel there to pledge allegiance to him, but have refused, the sources say.  when hariri s plane landed in riyadh, he got the message immediately that something was wrong,  a hariri source told reuters.  there was no one was waiting for him.   saudi arabia has dismissed suggestions it forced hariri to resign and says he is a free man. saudi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the circumstances of his arrival, whether his phone had been taken, or whether the kingdom was planning to replace him with his brother. hariri has given no public remarks since he resigned and no indication of when he might return to lebanon. hariri was summoned to the kingdom to meet saudi king salman in a phone call on thursday night, nov. 2. before departing, he told his officials they would resume their discussions on monday. he told his media team he would see them at the weekend in the red sea resort of sharm al sheikh, where he was due to meet egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi on the sidelines of the world youth forum. hariri went to his riyadh home. his family made their fortune in saudi arabia and have long had properties there. the source close to hariri said the lebanese leader received a call from a saudi protocol official on saturday morning, who asked him to attend a meeting with crown prince mohammed bin salman.  he waited for about four hours before being presented with his resignation speech to read on television, the source said.  from the moment he arrived they (saudis) showed no respect for the man,  another senior lebanese political source said. hariri frequently visits saudi arabia. on a trip a few days earlier, prince mohammed bin salman had arranged for him to see senior intelligence officials and gulf affairs minister thamer al sabhan, the saudi point man on lebanon. hariri came back from that trip to beirut  pleased and relaxed , sources in his entourage said. he posted a selfie with sabhan, both of them smiling. he told aides he had heard  encouraging statements  from the crown prince, including a promise to revive a saudi aid package for the lebanese army. the hariri sources say hariri believed he had convinced saudi officials of the need to maintain an entente with hezbollah for the sake of lebanon s stability. hezbollah has a heavily armed fighting force, in addition to seats in parliament and government. saudi backed efforts to weaken the group in lebanon a decade ago led to sunni shi ite clashes and a hezbollah takeover of beirut.   what happened in those meetings, i believe, is that (hariri) revealed his position on how to deal with hezbollah in lebanon: that confrontation would destabilize the country. i think they didn t like what they heard,  said one of the sources, who was briefed on the meetings. the source said hariri told sabhan not to  hold us responsible for something that is beyond my control or that of lebanon.  but hariri underestimated the saudi position on hezbollah, the source said.  for the saudis it is an existential battle. it s black and white. we in lebanon are used to gray,  the source said. sabhan could not immediately be reached for comment. hariri s resignation speech shocked his team. lebanese president michel aoun, a hezbollah ally, told ambassadors to lebanon that saudi arabia had kidnapped hariri, a senior lebanese official said. on friday, france said it wanted hariri to have  all his freedom of movement . in his speech, hariri said he feared assassination and accused iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in the region. he said the arab world would  cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it,  language which one source close to him said was not typical of the lebanese leader. hariri s resignation came as more than 200 people, including 11 saudi princes, current and former ministers and tycoons, were arrested in an anti corruption purge in saudi arabia. initially there was speculation hariri was a target of that campaign because of his family s business interests. but sources close to the lebanese leader said his forced resignation was motivated by saudi efforts to counter iran. hariri was taken to meet the saudi king after his resignation. footage was aired on saudi tv. he was then flown to abu dhabi to meet crown prince mohammed bin zayed, the saudi crown prince s main regional ally. he returned to riyadh and has since received western ambassadors. sources close to hariri said the saudis, while keeping hariri under house arrest, were trying to orchestrate a change of leadership in hariri s future movement by installing his elder brother bahaa, who was overlooked for the top job when their father was killed. the two have been at odds for years. in a statement, the future movement said it stood fully behind hariri as its leader. hariri aide and interior minister nohad machnouk dismissed the idea bahaa was being positioned to replace his brother:  we are not herds of sheep or a plot of land whose ownership can be moved from one person to another. in lebanon things happen though elections not pledges of allegiances.  family members, aides and politicians who have contacted hariri in riyadh say he is apprehensive and reluctant to say anything beyond  i am fine . asked if he is coming back, they say his normal answer is:  inshallah  (god willing).

" in the trump white house, it’s getting lonely at the top. president donald trump’s fellow republicans in congress are showing signs of going their own way, both on politics and policy, determined to salvage what they can of their agenda on healthcare and tax reform in the wake of one of the most difficult weeks of any american presidency. at the same time, trump’s failure to fill senior roles at federal agencies means he does not have a cadre of loyalists who can help rein in a bureaucracy that many in trump’s orbit believe are out to leak information intended to damage the president. that has worsened the isolation of the white house in a city that relies on friends and allies to shake off a crisis. the result is problems on multiple fronts: a government whose bonds with congress, federal agencies and the public look increasingly fractured; an ambitious but stalled program of reforms; and a president whose low approval ratings threaten his party’s control of congress in the 2018 midterm elections. trump and his beleaguered staff, some white house aides told reuters, feel besieged by a parade of negative stories and abandoned by fellow republicans on capitol hill, as the furor over the firing of fbi director james comey and allegations that trump tried to influence the probe into russian meddling in last year’s election show little sign of abating. since tuesday, when leaked excerpts of a purported memo by comey detailing his conversations with trump were made public, few republicans beyond the white house have rushed to the airwaves to push back against suggestions that the president may have obstructed justice in asking comey to end the probe into the conduct of former national security adviser michael flynn. as the russia probe entered a new phase on wednesday with the appointment of former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel in the investigation, a move that will likely place the white house under even stronger scrutiny, some republicans expressed surprise that the white house had not done more to recruit them to backstop the president. “it’s kind of funny. the answer is no,” said senator james inhofe, a republican from oklahoma, when asked by reuters whether the white house had reached out to him to come to trump’s defense. “i don’t know anyone else that has been contacted.”     the white house did not respond to a request for comment on this story. trump left on friday for his first foreign trip as president. the 10 day trip will take him to saudi arabia, israel, and europe.     the administration has continued to struggle to fill the hundreds of open positions at senior levels of government that remain open, leaving the white house alone to grapple with one challenge after another. for example, the justice department still lacks senior officials in place to head up the anti trust, civil rights, criminal, and civil divisions, as well as the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, according to its website. at the department of homeland security, the chiefs of the u.s. customs and border protection, immigration and customs enforcement, and the transportation security administration, have yet to be confirmed. and at the department of education, a sprawling bureaucracy of 4,400 employees with a $68 billion budget, “all the key roles except for the secretary remain empty or filled with people in an acting capacity,” said a department of education official. “nobody knows when or if they will be filled anytime soon,” said the official, who declined to be identified by name. the department did not respond to a request for comment. trump has frequently complained that senate democrats have stalled the approval process for his nominees. but the white house has also been slower to send nominees to the senate than previous administrations. many top state department posts also remain vacant. one consequence, say several officials, is that department experts played little role in briefing trump for his telephone call to russian president vladimir putin or his meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ambassador sergei kislyak, where officials say he disclosed highly classified intelligence. state department and intelligence officials say that as power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few trump loyalists in the white house, the roles of professional foreign service, intelligence and civil service officers have shrunk compared to past administrations. for instance, said two u.s. diplomats, no one from the state department attended trump’s feb. 15 meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu   a sharp contrast from past administrations which would typically staff such a high profile meeting with high level state department officials. asked for comment, the state department would not address the circumstances of the meeting with the russian officials in the oval office, but did speak to the efforts involving netanyahu and the middle east.  “as the president has repeatedly noted, middle east peace is a top priority for this administration,” a department spokesperson said. “this is an effort supported by both the white house and the state department. claims that the state department has not been involved have no basis in facts.”  overall, more than 500 of the 557 federal government positions requiring senate confirmation remain vacant. only 33 nominees have been confirmed, and only 57 other positions now have a nominee, according to the partnership for public service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in washington.     a lack of communication from the white house left many republicans on capitol hill frustrated as a sense of crisis mushroomed over the past week. one, richard burr, chairman of the senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own russia probe, publicly complained about the situation. tuesday morning, after news broke the previous evening that trump had shared classified information with russian officials, burr said he couldn’t get through to the white house, as the story lit up television news programs and buzzed online.  “maybe they’re busy,” he said. some republicans said the constant focus on responding to allegations concerning the russia probe was draining their caucus of focus and energy to push through their agenda. absent guidance, republican staff members in congress were beginning to devise their own strategy about how to respond to the gusher of bad news, one aide told reuters.  and at the white house, with lines of communication to congress seemingly frayed at times, a narrowing circle of people has come to the president’s defense, as senior staff grapple not only with the cascade of revelations but with a president who at times contradicts on twitter their talking points. “everyone is just tired,” said one white house aide.

" thai prime minister prayuth chan ocha has reshuffled his cabinet, a statement published in the royal gazette said on friday, the fifth change in his administration since he took power in 2014. prayuth, a former army chief, seized power in a bloodless may 2014 coup following months of street protests that led to the ousting of prime minister yingluck shinawatra and her civilian government. prayuth switched or appointed 18 ministers, deputy ministers and deputy prime ministers, according to a list published in the royal gazette, which was endorsed by thailand s king maha vajiralongkorn. the highest level changes include the country s ministers of commerce, agriculture, energy, labor, and tourism. it was not immediately clear what impact the reshuffle would have. the reshuffle was to improve some ministerial positions for the benefit of the country s administration, the statement said. the reshuffle follows the resignation of a labor minister. the cabinet has 36 members, and the latest changes cut members from the army to nine, including prayuth, from 12. laws passed by the government generally come into force after publication in the royal gazette, a public journal.  prayuth last reshuffled his cabinet in december 2016 following one in august 2015 which was carried out to focus on thailand s troubled economy. the junta has promised a general election in november 2018 to return thailand to democracy.

" prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on sunday he would present “responsible policies” in talks with u.s. president donald trump, signaling to the israeli far right to curb its territorial demands in the occupied west bank. netanyahu leaves for washington on monday and will see trump at the white house on wednesday for their first meeting since the republican’s inauguration last month, with the israeli palestinian conflict and policy toward iran on the agenda. during his 2016 election campaign, trump indicated his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians, after an acrimonious relationship between his predecessor barack obama and netanyahu that included clashes over settlement building and iran’s nuclear program. trump talked of moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem, naming an ambassador who backs israeli settlement on occupied land which palestinians seek for a state and exerting no pressure on israel for peace negotiations, which collapsed in 2014. but he has since toned down his pro israel bravado ahead of netanyahu’s visit, a change that could help the prime minister keep in check ultra nationalist coalition partners calling on him to push a more militant agenda. “to believe there are no restrictions now would be a mistake,” israel radio quoted netanyahu as telling members of his likud party with respect to settlement expansion now that trump is in office. on the eve of netanyahu’s departure for washington, education minister naftali bennett, leader of the ultra nationalist jewish home party, publicly cautioned him not to mention the words “two state solution” in talks with trump. bennett’s party is also promoting the annexation of parts of the west bank. netanyahu has stopped short of endorsing those positions   steps that would put israel at odds with long standing u.s. and european policies   while speaking of building in major settlement blocs israel intends to keep in any future peace deal. in public remarks to his cabinet on sunday, he seemed to urge the far right to tone down its expectations. “i understand there’s great excitement about this meeting (with trump),” he said. “but ... my primary concern is israel’s security (and) strengthening our solid alliance with the united states.” that, netanyahu said, “requires responsible policies, policies that are given careful consideration   and that’s how i intend to act.” he did not elaborate. his comments appeared to echo remarks trump made in an interview published on friday in the pro netanyahu israeli daily israel hayom. calling on israel “to be reasonable with respect to peace”, he said settlements “don’t help the process”. in recent weeks, netanyahu approved the construction of some 6,000 settler homes in the west bank and east jerusalem, drawing palestinian and international condemnation which the trump administration did not join. however, trump’s remarks in the israeli newspaper interview appeared to take a tougher line toward israeli settlement policy.

" the afghan air force took delivery of its first four u.s. made uh 60 black hawk helicopters on tuesday as part of a planned replacement of its aging fleet of russian made mi 17 helicopters, officials said. the u.s. plans to supply a total of 159 black hawks to afghanistan in the coming years as it boosts the capacity of the aaf, considered one of the best performing parts of the afghan defence and security forces.  the first afghan air force uh 60s arrived today in kandahar. they will help further develop a capable and sustainable aaf,  the nato led resolute support mission said. the robust soviet era mi 17 is the workhorse of the aaf, accounting for around half of all sorties in recent months and is very popular with afghan pilots.  as well as moving troops and casualties and flying in supplies to areas difficult to reach by road, the helicopters can also be fitted with weapons for close air support to units on the ground. however their age makes them increasingly difficult to maintain and replace and they are to be phased out over the coming years and replaced with refurbished black hawks, one of the mainstays of the u.s. army s helicopter force. according to a report in july by the special inspector general for afghanistan, a u.s. congressional watchdog, 19 of the aaf s 46 strong mi 17 fleet were unusable because they were undergoing overhaul or repair. in addition to operational considerations, the pentagon has also long faced political pressure from congress to switch spending to u.s. built aircraft. strengthening the afghan air force is a central part of president ashraf ghani s four year plan to improve afghan security forces which have struggled to contain the taliban insurgency since the nato led coalition backing the government ended its main combat operations in 2014.

" u.s. president elect donald trump on saturday left open the possibility of meeting with taiwan’s president if she visits the united states after he is sworn in on jan. 20 and also expressed continued skepticism over whether russia was responsible for computer hacks of democratic party officials. in remarks to reporters upon entering a new year’s eve celebration at his mar a lago estate, trump said, “we’ll see,” when pressed on whether he would meet tsai ing wen, taiwan’s president if she were to be in the united states at any point after he becomes president. taiwan’s president will be in transit in houston on jan. 7 and again will be in transit in san francisco on jan. 13. trump, citing protocol, said he would not meet with any foreign leaders while president barack obama is still in office. beijing bristled when trump, shortly after his nov. 8 victory, accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the taiwan leader and has warned against steps that would upset the “one china” policy china and the united states have maintained for decades. talk of a stop over in the united states by the taiwan president has further rattled washington beijing relations. on another foreign policy matter, trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on russia for the hacking of u.s. emails. the washington post also reported on friday that moscow could be behind intrusion into a laptop owned by a vermont electric utility. u.s. intelligence officials have said that they are confident russia was behind the hacks of political figures, which could have played a role in trump’s defeat over democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton.  “i think it’s unfair if we don’t know. it could be somebody else. i also know things that other people don’t know so we cannot be sure,” trump said. asked what that information included, the republican president elect said, “you will find out on tuesday or wednesday.” he did not elaborate. but he said that any computer is subject to hacks. “it’s very important. if you have something really important write it out and have it delivered by courier the old fashioned way,” trump said, adding, “no computer is safe, i don’t care what they say.” trump tried to end the year on a positive note, however, despite questions about the future of u.s. russia relations because of escalating tensions between obama and russian president vladimir putin, as well as trump’s promise to crack down on china’s trade practices, which he says unfairly target american workers. “hopefully we’re going to have great relationships with many countries and that includes russia and that includes china,” trump said. but he criticized u.s. secretary of state john kerry for earlier this week offering a stark assessment of israel’s policies in the middle east, which he said could threaten the possibility of establishing a palestinian state co existing with israel. trump called kerry’s speech “very unfair.” as he wrapped up a four minute informal chat with reporters, trump also was asked what his 2017 new year’s resolution was. “make america great again,” he said.

"president obama blasted republican presidential front-runner donald trump in april, 2016 for his plan to bar immigrants in the u.s. from sending money back home to force mexico to pay for a new border wall. oh, no. it s trump,  a smiling obama said when he was asked about the 2016 candidate s latest comments.obama called plan another shortsighted idea from trump that could spark concern among world leaders.  i am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made,  obama told reporters at the white house.obama said trump s border wall proposal could have  enormous  economic consequences for mexico, which receives billions of dollars in payments that immigrants in the u.s. send home, and possibly touch off a major spat with an ally. the notion that we are going to track every western union bit of money that s being sent to mexico   good luck with that,  obama said.obama s remarks came after the washington post published a two-page memo from trump outlining how he would get mexico to pay for his wall. trump s memo outlines how he would cut off certain remittances   cash transfers from people in the united states to mexico   unless mexico s government offered $5 billion to $10 billion to pay for the wall.mexican president enrique pe a nieto has said he won t pay for trump s wall and claimed the candidate has damaged u.s.-mexico relations.the country s former president, vicente fox, slammed the proposal, saying,  i m not going to pay for that f ing wall. meanwhile, tmz reported that workers are busy building a large wall around obama s new dc residence where he will be moving from the white house, that was coincidentally, also surrounded by a massive wall.why is it that politicians like obama and even republican speaker of the house paul ryan, who has a two-decade-long history of promoting open borders immigration policies, have no problem building a border fence for themselves and their family, even as they denies the american people those same protections.they re quick to criticize trump and his supporters for wanting to build a wall on our southern border to keep foreign intruders and criminals out for the sake of our national security, yet have no problem erecting large walls around their personal residences to keep their own families safe ",1
" chancellor angela merkel s conservatives widened their lead over the social democrats following a television debate in which merkel came across as more convincing and reliable than her spd challenger martin schulz, a poll showed on thursday. the weekly survey by infratest dimap for ard television showed support for merkel s cdu/csu bloc holding steady at 37 percent while the spd dropped two percentage points to 21 percent   their lowest reading in the poll since early january. the pollster questioned 1,503 voters from monday to wednesday, meaning the survey was the first fully conducted after sunday s television debate in which hardly any policy differences emerged between merkel and schulz. the anti immigration, euro hostile afd came in unchanged at 11 percent, making it the third strongest political force. the radical left followed with 10 percent, up 1 point. the business friendly fdp scored 9 percent, also up 1 point, while the environmental greens were unchanged at 8 percent. the polls indicated two parties fdp and the afd should enter the bundestag as they look set to beat the 5 percent threshold. the fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between merkel s cdu/csu and the spd. another scenario could be a tricky three way  jamaica  coalition between merkel s conservatives, the fdp and the greens, though such a broad alliance has never been tested on the federal level before.

"protesters who take to the streets in north dakota might want to look both ways for changes in the rules of the road.a bill sponsored by state rep. keith kempenich, r-bowman, would protect drivers from legal consequences if they inadvertently hit, injure or kill pedestrians who are obstructing traffic.the legislation is a direct response to the massive protests around the standing rock indian reservation, kempenich said. the ongoing protests have shut down a nearby highway for months and stalled construction of a pipeline that would carry crude from the north dakota oil patch. if you stay off the roadway, this would never be an issue,  kempenich said.  those motorists are going about the lawful, legal exercise of their right to drive down the road.   those people didn t ask to be in this. the legislation has drawn withering criticism from standing rock supporters, who worry that it could be open season for protesters on north dakota roads.kempenich said he wants to shift the blame for a crash from drivers to the people who choose to protest in traffic. the legislation, he said, would not protect someone who deliberately tries to run down a protester, and it would not let drivers off the hook if they hit a jaywalker or a child chasing a ball into the street. this bill puts the onus on somebody who s made a conscious decision to put themselves in harm s way,  he said.  you can protest all you want, but you can t protest up on a roadway. it s dangerous for everybody.    star tribunehighways shouldn t be used as staging areas for protests, kempenich said.  they re intentionally putting themselves in danger,  he said, adding that accidents could result.blocking roads or highways has also been a tactic adopted on occasion by protesters in other movements, such as black lives matter.a spokeswoman for the pipeline protests said she is concerned the bill, if passed, would give careless drivers a free pass to kill or maim people who are exercising their free speech rights. it is basically giving permission for vehicular homicide, and that is wrong,  said joye braun, an organizer for the indigenous environmental network.  nobody has the right to take the life of another person. the network is an activist group that opposes the pipeline, which would carry bakken crude oil across the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation. protesters say the pipeline s path crosses sacred land and could endanger the tribe s source of drinking water.braun said she once was struck by a woman who objected to her video-recording a protest outside a fast-food restaurant in mandan, and she worries the bill would embolden people to harm pipeline protesters. i believe there is a small element who may use this as an excuse to attack people,  braun said.the proposal has attracted some national attention. robert reich, a former u.s. labor secretary and liberal commentator, has criticized the bill.-inforum",1
" bernie sanders’ democratic presidential campaign has sued ohio’s secretary of state in federal court over what it calls an unconstitutional attempt to prevent young people from voting in the state’s march 15 primary election. “it is an outrage that the secretary of state in ohio is going out of his way to keep young people – significantly african american young people, latino young people – from participating,” the u.s. senator from vermont said in a statement released on tuesday. the lawsuit, filed in u.s. district court in columbus and  joined by six ohio 17 year olds, alleged that a directive by republican secretary of state jon husted would “arbitrarily discriminate” against young voters. citing u.s. census figures, it said such voters were more likely to be black or latino than older groups of voters. sanders, who is seeking the democratic nomination for the nov. 8 election, has attracted support from young voters but has lagged behind rival hillary clinton in winning votes among minorities. ohio is one of more than 20 states where 17 year olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election are allowed to vote in primaries, the campaign statement said. husted ruled last december that those voters would not be allowed to participate in the presidential primary. he denied there had been any changes to voting rules.  “we are following the same rules ohio has operated under in past primaries, under both democrat and republican administrations. there is nothing new here,” husted said on twitter. “if you are going to be 18 by the november election, you can vote, just not on every issue.”  he said that 17 year olds were “not permitted to elect candidates, which is what voters are doing in a primary when they elect delegates to represent them at their political party’s national convention.”         (reporting by eric walsh in washington; editing by peter cooney) this article was funded in part by sap. it was independently created by the reuters editorial staff. sap had no editorial involvement in its creation or production.",0

" taxi drivers protesting the growth of mobile ride hailing applications such as uber and cabify blocked the main road to chile s principal airport in capital santiago on monday, leading to one death and wreaking havoc on travelers  plans. santiago based latam airlines, the region s biggest carrier, as well as budget carrier sky suffered delays, local media reported. television images showed traffic backed up for miles (kilometers), while many passengers resorted to walking along the highway. one 65 year old brazilian tourist stuck in traffic died of a cardiovascular event, chilean police said without offering any further details. a medical helicopter evacuated the man, but it was too late, they added.   this takeover of the airport by the taxi drivers has significantly hurt the image of chile, the image of the airlines, and has hurt people traveling or arriving in the country,  claudio orrego, the governor of the santiago metropolitan region, told reporters. he added that the government would bring charges against those responsible for the protests, and that at least 15 people had already been arrested. legislation is advancing slowly through chile s congress to regulate uber and cabify, which remain in a legal gray zone. while some authorities have promised to sanction users of the widely used applications, they have also expressed a desire to bring the services within chile s existing regulatory framework.

" air strikes by the saudi led military coalition in yemen have killed at least 136 civilians and non combatants since dec. 6, the u.n. human rights spokesman said on tuesday. other u.n. officials said the coalition was maintaining tight restrictions on ships reaching yemen even though 8 million yemenis are on the brink of famine with the country relying on imports for the bulk of its food, fuel and medicine.  we are deeply concerned at the recent surge in civilian casualties in yemen as a result of intensified air strikes by the ... coalition, following the killing of former president ali abdullah saleh in sanaa on dec. 4,  human rights spokesman rupert colville told a news briefing.  incidents verified by the u.n. human rights office included seven air strikes on a prison in the shaub district of sanaa on dec. 13 that killed at least 45 detainees thought to be loyal to president abd rabbu mansour hadi, who is backed by saudi arabia.  one can assume that was a mistake, they weren t intending to kill prisoners from their own side,  colville said.  it s an illustration of lack of due precaution.  other air strikes killed 14 children and six adults in a farmhouse in hodeidah governorate on dec. 15, as well as a woman and nine children returning from a wedding party in marib governorate on dec. 16, he said. air strikes verified by the u.n. rights office in sanaa, saada, hodeidah and taiz governorates also injured 87 civilians.  if in a specific event due precaution is not taken or civilians are deliberately targeted, that can easily be a war crime,  colville said.  it is up to a court to make a ruling, he said, but there had been so many similar incidents in yemen, it would be hard to conclude war crimes had not taken place. on tuesday saudi air defenses intercepted a ballistic missile fired towards the capital riyadh but there were no reports of casualties, the coalition said, the latest in a series of attacks by the iran aligned houthi group in yemen. the restrictions on access to yemen imposed by the coalition became a total blockade on nov. 6 though conditions were eased on nov. 25 to allow aid ships and some commercial cargoes to reach the shattered arabian peninsula country. the u.n. world food programme has brought in enough food for 1.8 million people for two months, but far more is needed.

" congressional republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down obamacare following donald trump’s election as u.s. president, including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation. trump’s victory on tuesday means republicans will control the white house, senate and house of representatives. but congressional democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. the affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, has provided 25 million previously uninsured americans with health coverage. republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach. wyoming senator john barrasso, a member of senate republican leadership, said one way for the incoming president and congress to attack obamacare immediately after trump takes office on jan. 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of health and human services, the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law. “we could confirm someone on jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states, to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers,” barrasso said in a telephone interview. barrasso noted that the senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100 seat chamber to confirm cabinet members, as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the democrats could present to repeal legislation. passing repeal legislation “is not a ‘day one’ activity. but a new secretary of hhs going after the regulations can be a ‘day one’ activity,” barrasso added. trump during the campaign called obamacare “a disaster” and joined fellow republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax free health savings accounts. his transition website says trump wants a solution that “returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states.” in repealing obamacare, congressional republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around democrats in the senate, where rules protect the rights of the minority party. republicans in congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of obamacare in january, but obama vetoed the legislation. the bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage, as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law, and would have eliminated expansion of the medicaid insurance health insurance program.  republican representative chris collins of new york, one of trump’s earliest supporters on capitol hill, said he hopes congress can pass a similar bill gutting obamacare within trump’s first 100 days in office, a promise trump made during the presidential campaign. but some changes will doubtless be phased in over time, collins said. “there’s nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone’s health insurance plan for 2017,” collins said in an interview. “from a replacement standpoint, our position has always been as republicans to move forward in a step by step fashion,” barrasso said. in an interview with the wall street journal published on friday, trump said he was considering retaining parts of obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions. while waiting for congress to act on legislation, the new hhs secretary could be reworking obamacare regulations, barrasso said. for example, regulations could give u.s. states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law, such as exemptions from the so called individual mandate requiring americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it. kim monk, an analyst at capital alpha partners, which provides policy research to financial institutions, said trump’s hhs might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for obamacare. insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill. hhs might also be able to alter the language on “essential benefits” that the law requires insurance plans to cover, which include trips to the emergency room, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services, monk said. “the law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories, but how that gets defined, a lot of that is interpretative,” monk said. “and of course, everything the obama administration interpreted was more, more, more, more expensive coverage, and all these things lead to premium increases.” collins, a member of the trump transition team’s executive committee, said the job of hhs secretary or surgeon general “would be great for ben carson,” referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination and later endorsed trump.

" indonesian and regional authorities heightened flight warnings around bali s mount agung on sunday as the volcano s eruptions sent a plume of volcanic ash and steam more than 6,000 metres into the skies above the popular holiday island. ash covered roads, cars and buildings near the volcano in the northeast of the island, while scores of flights were cancelled and overnight a red glow of what appeared to be magma could be seen in photographs by antara, the state news agency.  the activity of mount agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase. it is still spewing ash at the moment but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption,  said gede suantika, an official at the volcanology and geological disaster mitigation agency. bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year but business has slumped in areas around the volcano since september when agung s volcanic tremors began to increase. agung rises majestically over eastern bali at a height of just over 3,000 metres. when it last erupted in 1963 it killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages. australia s bureau of meteorology s volcanic ash advisory centre (vacc) in darwin issued maps showing an ash cloud heading southeast over the neighbouring island of lombok, away from  bali s capital, denpasar, where the main international airport is located. indonesia also upgraded its volcano observatory notice for aviation (vona) to red, its highest warning, and said the ash cloud top could reach 19,654 feet (6,142 metres) or higher.  however, officials said the airport would remain open for now as the ash could be avoided.  the volcanic ash has only been detected in a certain area,  the airport and other officials said in a joint statement. all domestic flights and the airport itself were operating as  normal  and tests for ash had been negative, it said. yunus suprayogi, general manager of bali airport operator angkasa pura i, said food and entertainment would be provided as well as extra bus services if conditions changed and passenger numbers increased.  the airport would also  make it easier  for passengers to seek refunds and make other arrangements, he said, while noting that airlines had their own rules. after resuming flights on sunday morning, virgin australia again cancelled flights on sunday afternoon following a change in the aviation colour code from orange to red.   due to the significant volcanic ash and current weather conditions, we have made the decision to cancel the rest of today s flights to and from bali as a precautionary measure,  virgin said in a statement on its website. airasia also cancelled its remaining flights to bali and lombok. qantas and jetstar flights were continuing as of sunday afternoon but jetstar warned on its website that flights could be subject to change at short notice for safety reasons. indonesia s flag carrier garuda said it was cancelling all flights to and from lombok.  lombok airport was closed late on sunday afternoon and authorities would assess the situation in the morning, a transport ministry spokesman said.  indonesia s disaster agency has said bali is  still safe  for tourists except for a 7.5 kilometre (4.7 mile) zone around mount agung.  despite the string of eruptions, there has not been an increase in volcanic activity,  it said in a statement, noting that the emergency status for agung remains at level 3, one below the highest. china s consulate in denpasar warned citizens on sunday to  be prepared for the possibility of being stranded  in bali.

" the united states should significantly cut spending on the north atlantic treaty organization, republican presidential front runner donald trump said on monday, questioning a policy that has underpinned u.s. foreign relations for nearly 70 years.  trump, whose worldviews have been rebuked by a section of the republican establishment, made the comments as he unveiled a partial list of foreign policy advisers, who are relatively little known. “we are paying disproportionately (for nato). it’s too much and frankly it’s a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea,” trump said in an interview on cnn. “we have to reconsider. keep nato, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward nato itself.” nato, now consisting of 28 members, was formed after world war two as a western military alliance against the soviet bloc. the comments reinforced trump’s relatively isolationist stance on foreign policy. the new york billionaire businessman has alarmed establishment republican foreign policy thinkers with comments denigrating muslims and mexican immigrants, and with his vows to tear up international trade deals.  announcing his foreign policy advisers in an interview with the washington post editorial board, he said the united states should not be “nation building anymore,” adding that washington could not afford to keep funding nato at current levels. “we certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he said. trump has said he is willing to work more closely with authoritarian russian president vladimir putin, whose military intervention in ukraine has increased tensions with nato. washington is the biggest contributor to nato, and u.s. officials have long been critical of its european allies for not spending more.   nato is planning its biggest buildup in eastern europe since the cold war to deter russia, helped by an increase in planned u.s. spending. “the happiest person hearing this would be vladimir putin,” said retired admiral james stavridis, nato’s former supreme allied commander europe. “we are all frustrated with low european defense spending, but pulling away from nato would be an extraordinary geopolitical mistake.”     trump’s advisory team includes terrorism expert walid phares, energy industry executive carter page, international energy lawyer george papadopoulos, former pentagon inspector general joe schmitz and former army lieutenant general keith kellogg. he said he would soon name more people helping him shape his foreign policies as part of the team, led by u.s. senator jeff sessions, a republican from alabama who endorsed trump last month.  “taken as a group, it’s a fairly obscure set of individuals,” said michael o’hanlon, a national security and defense policy specialist at the brookings institution, adding he did not recognize most of the names on trump’s list.  trump, one of three remaining republican presidential candidates for the nov. 8 election, has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to say who advises him on foreign and security matters. one hundred and twenty republican national security experts who served in past presidential administrations have signed a letter saying they cannot support trump and will work to ensure he is not elected. phares told reuters he began advising trump on friday. he previously served as a national security adviser to 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney, who has roundly criticized trump. phares said in an email he had not met trump in person since last year. the others on the list could not be immediately reached to confirm their roles with trump’s campaign.     schmitz was pentagon inspector general under president george w. bush and worked for blackwater worldwide, a now defunct private u.s. security firm whose personnel were involved in a deadly shooting that killed iraqi civilians in 2007. kellogg has considerable military experience, having served as chief operating officer of the coalition provisional authority, the u.s. run provisional government imposed on iraq after the u.s. led 2003 invasion under bush. he has worked at caci international, a virginia based intelligence and information technology consulting firm. trump has vigorously criticized the invasion. asked at a news conference about why he chose kellogg despite his role in iraq, trump said: “i don’t have to agree with them but i have to hear different opinions.” according to the post, papadopoulos previously advised trump’s former rival ben carson, who has now backed trump. the london center of international law practice’s center website lists him as the head of its center for international energy and natural resources law & security. page serves as a managing partner of global energy capital, a private energy services company, the post said. sessions is not seen as an influential foreign policy or national security player in the u.s. congress. he does not serve on the senate foreign relations committee, although he is a member of the armed services committee. last week, trump said in a television interview on msnbc, which had been pressing him to name his foreign advisory team, that he relied on his own instinct. “i’m speaking with myself, number one, because i have a very good brain,” he told msnbc. “i know what i’m doing. ... my primary consultant is myself.” ",0
" the u.s. justice department filed an appeal late saturday to restore president donald trump’s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees, even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted. the government moved to reverse a federal judge’s friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public, thwarted enforcement of an executive order and “second guesses the president’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of (non citizens) and the best means of minimizing that risk.”  friday’s ruling prompted trump to denounce the “so called” judge in a series of tweets on saturday..  the appeal now goes to a three judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal. a justice department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. a ruling could come at any time. seattle u.s. district judge james robart’s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the united states.  trump, whose personal attack on robart, decrying his opinion as “ridiculous,” went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the white house and congress, said he was confident the government would prevail. “we’ll win. for the safety of the country, we’ll win,” he told reporters in florida. robart’s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of washington state and was backed by major state employers amazon.com inc and expedia inc.. the lawsuit is one of several now filed against the trump executive order around the united states, but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide. the justice department appeal criticized robart’s legal reasoning, saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president’s authority as commander chief. the appeal said the state of washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order “favors christians at the expense of muslims.” congress gave the president “the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class” of visitor, the justice department wrote. “courts are particularly ill equipped to second guess the president’s prospective judgment about future risks,” the appeal said, calling the decision “vastly overbroad.” washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at u.s. airports, where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president’s directive. a spokesman for washington state attorney general bob ferguson didn’t immediately comment early sunday. the u.s. state department and department of homeland security said they were complying with robart’s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on sunday, while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on monday. a decision to reinstate trump’s order could again cause havoc at u.s. airports because some visitors are in transit, as was the case when the order took effect on jan. 27. as the ban lifted friday, refugees and thousands of travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the  executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the united states. the panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former republican president george w. bush and two former democratic presidents, jimmy carter and barack obama. u.s. immigration advocacy groups including the american civil liberties union on saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations “to consider rebooking travel to the united states immediately” because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold. a u.s. state department email reviewed by reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including syrians as soon as monday. trump’s jan. 27 order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority muslim nations for 90 days, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred syrian refugees.  it is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the u.s. constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and congress. reached by email saturday, robart declined comment on trump’s tweets. democratic u.s. senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement saturday that trump’s “hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. he seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.” in an interview with abc scheduled to air sunday, vice president mike pence said he did not think that trump’s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. the court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to trump’s push to clamp down on immigration. the sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the united states will remain open. in erbil, the capital of the kurdish region of northern iraq, fuad sharef and his family prepared to fly on saturday to istanbul and then new york before starting a new life in nashville, tennessee. virtually all refugees also were barred by trump’s order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the united states.

" with nafta talks grinding toward stalemate, u.s. president donald trump may be tempted to carry out his threat to withdraw from the trade pact, but legal experts say such a decision  could be defeated, or delayed significantly by court challenges. the constitutional and statutory authority for who can terminate the 1994 north american free trade agreement   trump or the u.s. congress   is deeply disputed, and it may take the u.s. supreme court or a truce between the white house and capitol hill to sort it out.    private sector executives said that major u.s. business groups are preparing legal challenges to any withdrawal by the  united states, although the plaintiffs had not yet been determined. litigation would lay bare the fault lines between trump’s populist vision and the pro trade, business friendly lawmakers of his republican party, many of whom are increasingly nervous that nafta will collapse and cause economic damage.. “i think this is headed for a huge legal morass if the president were to unilaterally send a notice of withdrawal,” said jennifer hillman, a georgetown university law professor and former world trade organization (wto) appellate judge. “there will be immediate challenges across the board.”    nafta’s original text allows a country to withdraw from the agreement six months after it provides written notice to the other parties, but neither the agreement nor u.s. implementing legislation specifies how that should be decided. once the six month period ends, the president can declare the restoration of u.s. tariffs on canada and mexico to wto levels, although some legal experts say congress may ultimately have authority over this. the three countries were wrapping up a fifth round of talks to update nafta on tuesday with major differences yet to be resolved. the nafta implementing law would be untouched by a trump withdrawal, creating what some call a “zombie” trade pact without tariff free access, but other provisions would remain. some of those rules are opposed by the trump administration, including the “chapter 19” arbitration system that often thwarts u.s. anti dumping cases against canada and mexico, as well as labor, environmental and regional content requirements that u.s. officials see as weak. trump would need congress’ approval to repeal that law. winning that vote could be extremely difficult, as most congressional republicans follow their business and farm constituents in being advocates of free trade in general and nafta in particular. “the president would want to get congress on board so that the implementing legislation is coherent,” said dean pinkert, a trade lawyer and former u.s. international trade commission member. almost any court challenge would argue that trump needs congressional approval to quit nafta because congress has explicit authority in the u.s. constitution over tariffs and trade. but the president historically has held power over foreign policy matters such as international treaties. the supreme court is often reluctant to rule on questions of authority between the executive and legislative branches of government and prefers legislative solutions instead. in a 1979 case, the court sided with president jimmy carter after senator barry goldwater challenged his authority to nullify a defense treaty with taiwan. but that pact did not  have a trade component and was clearly a foreign policy issue. if the supreme court did rule on a nafta withdrawal challenge, much would depend on how the case is argued, said     tim meyer, an international law professor at vanderbilt university in nashville, tennessee.  “if the case is successfully framed as to who has authority over foreign affairs, i think the president wins,” meyer said. georgetown university’s hillman said her reading of the constitutional question and implementing legislation stacks up against trump   that congress only explicitly intended for the president to implement nafta, not the reverse. “nafta unequivocally falls under the commerce clause of the constitution,” hillman said.

" the former head of equifax inc (efx.n) apologized repeatedly on tuesday at a congressional hearing for the theft of millions of people’s personal data in a hacking breach, saying it took weeks for the credit bureau to understand the extent of the intrusion. richard smith retired last week but the 57 year old executive led the company over the time of the hack, which equifax acknowledged in early september. late on monday, equifax said an independent review had increased the estimate of potentially affected u.s. consumers by 2.5 million to 145.5 million. in march, the u.s. department of homeland security alerted equifax to an online gap in security but the company did nothing, said smith. “the vulnerability remained in an equifax web application much longer than it should have,” smith said. “i am here today to apologize to the american people myself.” equifax keeps a trove of consumer data for banks and other creditors who want to know whether a customer is likely to default. smith said both technology and human error opened the company’s system to the cyber hack, which has been a calamity for equifax, costing it about a quarter of its stock market value and leading several top executives to depart. a company employee failed to tell the information team a software vulnerability that hackers could exploit should be fixed, smith said. then, a later system scan did not uncover the weak point. smith said he was notified on july 31 that “suspicious activity had occurred,” after security personnel had already disabled the web application and shut down the hacking. he said he only learned in the middle of august the scope of the stolen data.  on aug. 2, the company alerted the federal bureau of investigation and retained a law firm and consulting firm to provide advice. smith notified the board’s lead director on aug. 22. that timing could help lift suspicions that three executives who sold stock on the first two days of august illegally used insider knowledge of the hack. smith said the three “honorable men” did not know about the breach at that time.  smith deferred to the fbi on questions of whether the hack had been sponsored by a nation state. “it’s possible,” he said when asked if the hackers were from another country.

" a federal appeals court on wednesday rejected an effort by news media to force prosecutors in the george washington bridge lane closing scandal known as “bridgegate” to disclose the names of unindicted co conspirators. reversing a lower court ruling, the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals in philadelphia found no right of public access under the u.s. constitution’s first amendment or the common law to a list of people implicated but not criminally charged. the 3 0 decision came one day before jury selection was scheduled to begin in the trial of two former allies of new jersey governor chris christie who are accused of arranging the september 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in fort lee, new jersey, causing several days of gridlock. “public access to judicial documents and court proceedings is a respected tradition and important legal principle, but it has bounds,” circuit judge kent jordan wrote. while it may make sense to release the names at trial, “that time is not here yet,” he added. prosecutors accused william baroni, a former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, and bridget anne kelly, a former christie deputy chief of staff, of closing lanes to punish fort lee’s democratic mayor, mark sokolich, for not endorsing the successful re election of christie, a republican. disclosing the list could have shown whether other christie allies sought political payback by snarling traffic. another former port authority official, david wildstein, is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty. christie has denied involvement, but the scandal helped erode his once high approval ratings. he ran unsuccessfully this year for the white house. his office had no immediate comment. u.s. district judge susan wigenton in newark had in may ordered disclosing the names of unindicted co conspirators, but a “john doe” on the list appealed, fearing reputational harm. bruce rosen, a lawyer for media companies including abc, the associated press and the new york times, in an email said his clients are disappointed, and no decision on an appeal has been made. doe’s lawyer, jenny kramer, in an email said she was gratified that the appeals court “prevented disclosure of highly prejudicial material.” a spokesman for u.s. attorney paul fishman in new jersey, who supported doe, declined to comment. baroni and kelly have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy charges, and received the list of names to help prepare for trial. their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on tuesday nine war ships set for construction in 2020 will be fitted with long range  anti missile defense systems to counter the threat of rogue nations. australia s proposed frigates will use aegis combat systems, produced by lockheed martin, in conjunction with saab australia technology, turnbull said. tensions in the region have spiked considerably in recent months as north korea conducted a series of tests of its medium  and long range ballistic missiles, some of which flew over japan, as well as its sixth nuclear test on sept. 3. pyongyang, which ultimately wants to target the u.s. mainland with a nuclear tipped ballistic missile, has said its missiles could strike australia.  recent events in our region have proven that australia s future frigates must be equipped to defend australia from the threat of medium  and long range missile attacks,  turnbull said in a speech in sydney. work on the frigates is set to begin in 2020, with bae systems, navantia and fincantieri all competing for the a$35 billion ($27.39 billion) contract. turnbull said the decision to award the missile defense system contract allows the three bidders enough time to incorporate aegis technology into their bids. australia is expected to announce the winner of the frigate contract in early 2018. the decision to fit the frigates   also a cornerstone of australia s plan to counter an expected rise in submarine activity in the region   suggests canberra will use the ships in a dual capacity.  the missile defense will protect australia s forward based forces and in a coalition scenario,  said euan graham, director of the national security program at the lowy institute, an australian think tank. countering submarines requires vessels that move freely in the region, in contrast to static vessels used for detecting missiles. the decision to use the aegis ballistic missile defense systems brings australia in line with u.s., japanese and korean vessels, allowing international cooperation, vice admiral tim barrett, australia s navy chief, told reporters in sydney.  the choice of the aegis system allows australia to plug into the u.s. alliance. they will be able to share data from vessels and potentially aircraft,  said graham. the frigates will be the next major component of australia s plan to increase defense spending by a$30 billion to be worth a$195 billion, or 2 percent of gdp, by 2021 2022 as canberra seeks to protect its strategic and trade interests in the asia pacific. australia selected french naval contractor dcns last year to build its fleet of 12 submarines, ahead of other offers from japan and germany, one the world s most lucrative defense contracts.

" (this version of the july 23 story corrects reference to a 29 super tucano in para 7. the aircraft are built in the united states under an agreement between their brazilian manufacturer, embraer and sierra nevada corp.) as the u.s. administration prepares its new strategy for afghanistan, the kabul government and its western allies are working hard to develop an air force that gives government forces the advantage in their war against taliban militants. the level of equipment, training and assets falls far short of matching the air assets the americans still maintain in afghanistan, but billions of dollars are earmarked for the force which is being built up almost from scratch. “that is what will provide the asymmetric advantage to break the stalemate on the ground,” brigadier general phillip stewart, commander of taac air, the resolute support mission advising the air force, told reuters. a four year, $7 billion expansion plan is aimed at training more flight and maintenance crews and increasing the number of aircraft in the afghan air force (aaf). “in 2014, remember, we (nato and the u.s. military in afghanistan) had the best air force in the world and the coalition pulled out and we realized we hadn’t grown the afghan air force,” stewart said. u.s. officers say the aim is to build a counter insurgency force able to support troops fighting in remote and forbidding terrain with air strikes, supplies and intelligence. the air force is already conducting some air strikes using brazilian designed a 29 super tucano light attack aircraft and specially adapted md 530 scout helicopters and it is building capacity in other areas. last month, an afghan air crew parachuted around 400 kg of supplies to an isolated border police outpost, the first time the aaf had conducted an aerial supply drop. “we can do casualty evacuations, we can take cargo, we can take ammunition, we can transport vehicles to different places where they can’t go by road,” said major khail shinwari, an afghan c 130 hercules pilot. the aaf has about 120 aircraft in service, ranging from small propeller cessna 208s to old soviet era helicopters, as well as the a 29s, md 530s and its four veteran c 130 hercules transporters. in coming years, the old russian mi 17s helicopters, which are increasingly difficult to maintain, will be replaced by american uh 60 black hawks. the aaf says it is flying up to 140 sorties a day, carrying supplies and providing close air support to troops fighting the afghan taliban and islamic state. but whether it can be built up quickly enough to turn the tide against the stubborn taliban insurgency is unclear. all the air power of the nato led coalition was not enough to defeat the militants and the aaf is nowhere near being able operate alone. u.s. drones, f 16s and apache attack helicopters are still heavily engaged in areas like helmand, where u.s. aircraft conducted at least 52 air strikes in the space of five days last week in support of afghan forces. for the moment, the afghan a 29s are still using unguided bombs rather than the guided weapons used by the americans, and the md 530 helicopters, which came into service in 2015, fire machine guns and rockets attached to their landing gear. “it’s close air support but not as anyone who grew up in the u.s. air force would understand it,” stewart said. “it’s not precision, it’s .50 cal(ibre machine guns) and rockets but they get close to their work and they’re very good.” u.s. trainers say afghan pilots and crews are being trained to a standard comparable with their american counterparts. but the length of time it takes to train crews   up to four years for pilots and as much as seven years for specialized mechanics   means it will be years before the air force can operate fully independently. for the moment, the emphasis is on building a force suitable for afghanistan, which means using less complicated equipment such as the c 208s or md 350 helicopters “at the expense of maybe getting some bigger, sexier platform,” stewart said. the aim is to increase the effectiveness of the security forces, which advisers hope to get to a point where the taliban are forced to negotiate a political settlement. as the aaf has grown, however, it has faced increasing pressure from army units to step up operations. advisers say one of the main risks it faces is overstretch. “they just don’t have the airplanes and sometimes the ground forces will become frustrated because they want more,” stewart said.

" sweden will start negotiations on a $1.2 billion raytheon co  patriot air defense missile system, as interest in missile defense systems strengthens amid heightened regional tensions and ballistic missile technology improves globally.  the swedish government said on tuesday negotiations with the u.s. company will target delivery beginning in 2020, and for the system to be operational by 2025 at the latest. iran, north korea and russia, among others, have made advancements in their missile technology.  raytheon said,  sweden s announcement brings them closer to joining the growing group of european nations depending on the combat proven patriot to defend against ballistic and cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft and drones.  the swedish government said,  based on this tender and the decision of the riksdag (the swedish parliament) on the proposal to acquire a new medium range air defense system in the 2018 budget bill, the government will make a final decision on the acquisition during 2018.  lockheed martin corp, the pentagon s no. 1 weapons supplier, said in august its customers want to defend themselves against possible incoming missile attacks and are increasingly asking about missile defense systems. raytheon has built more than 220 patriot fire units and delivered them to customers in 13 nations including the netherlands and germany.    the swedish defense materiel administration (fmv) has been authorized to send a l\letter of request to the united states, and to enter into negotiations for procurement of the patriot system. the contract value is estimated to exceed 10 billion swedish crowns ($1.2 billion), fmv said in a statement. u.s. soldiers and german airmen fired the first of dozens of live patriot and stinger missiles on monday as part of an exercise at a nato base in crete aimed at strengthening the response to possible attacks from russia or other countries. the exercise, which continues through thursday on the greek island, will include a series of emerging  real world threats  such as the use of drones, electronic warfare and electromagnetic pulses, u.s. army colonel david shank, commander of the 10th army air and missile defense command, told reuters. the exercises come amid a big push by the united states, germany and other nato members to rebuild short range air defense systems after the shock of russia s annexation of the crimea region of ukraine and its support of separatists in the donbass region of ukraine.

" iran s military chief of staff visited a frontline position near the syrian city of aleppo, a military news outlet run by the lebanese group hezbollah reported on friday, during a visit that has underlined tehran s deep military role in syria. general mohammad baqeri visited the position with a number of iranian officers, according to the report, which was  accompanied by photos showing baqeri looking at a map and peering through binoculars. neighboring israel has expressed deep concern over iran s role in syria, where iranian fighters and iran backed groups such as hezbollah have played a major role fighting in support of president bashar al assad. baqeri met assad on thursday during a visit to set out a joint military strategy, syrian state media reported.  baqeri has warned israel against breaching syrian airspace and territory and pledged to increase cooperation with syria s military to fight both israel and sunni jihadist militants. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has said that iran is strengthening its foothold in syria, warning that israel would  do whatever it takes  to protect its security. helped by russian air power, iran backed groups including hezbollah played a major part in the syrian government campaign to recapture eastern districts of aleppo city from syrian rebels last year. rural areas to the south and west of the city are still in insurgent hands.

" puerto rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on thursday just minutes after u.s. president barack obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island’s $70 billion in debt. the executive order issued by puerto rico’s governor, alejandro garcia padilla, comes just one day before the u.s. territory was due to make $1.9 billion worth of debt payments on july 1, including some $780 million in constitutionally backed, general obligation bonds. it remains to be seen whether puerto rico will pay part of the go debt or any of the non go debt. “under these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving puerto ricans without basic services,” garcia padilla’s administration said in a statement.  the flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decade long struggle by puerto rico, home to 3.5 million americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economy’s decline.      garcia padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in u.s. district court in manhattan.  in addition, garcia padilla also declared states of emergency at the island’s biggest public pension   the commonwealth’s employee retirement system   which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the university of puerto rico and other agencies. puerto rico’s benchmark 2035 general obligation bond rose 0.44 points in price to trade at 67.19 points, pushing the yield down to 12.578 percent.     in washington, obama signed the puerto rico oversight, management and economic stability act, or promesa, in the oval office on thursday, one of the few pieces of bi partisan legislation to make it to his desk. “i want to let the people of puerto rico know that although there are still some tough work that we’re going to have to do to dig puerto rico out of the hole that it’s in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need,” obama told reporters before signing it. the law will allow the island access to a bankruptcy like debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federally appointed board — a condition that has riled many in puerto rico, including garcia padilla. promesa, which passed the u.s. senate on wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default. puerto rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year. the stay is critical to keep puerto rico’s financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles. the stay is retroactive back to december 2015. the oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push puerto rico into a court supervised process akin to u.s. bankruptcy. it will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets.     still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should puerto rico not deliver the cash to its investors. mbia’s national public finance guarantee insures about $173 million in go debt due on friday, while assured guaranty covers another $184 million, and ambac insures $40 million in go or go guaranteed debt due on friday.      the island’s debt laden semi public power utility, prepa,  earlier on thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors.  prepa, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. the payment will be made using operational funds and proceeds from new bond sales. “today’s outcome is another step towards prepa’s transformation,” lisa donahue, the utility’s chief restructuring officer, said in a statement.

" east timor president francisco  lu olo  guterres swore in the remaining members of the new cabinet on tuesday and urged the first minority government since independence to focus on improving living conditions and avoiding political upheaval.  the new administration led by prime minister mari alkatiri   faces pressure to lift flagging oil production in the nation of 1.3 million people, where unemployment and poverty remain rife. alkatiri, who was east timor s first prime minister after independence in 2002, stood down in 2006 following a wave of unrest sparked by the sacking of 600 soldiers. his fretilin party won the most votes in july s election but failed to get an outright majority.    guterres said in a speech at the presidential palace that the country expected good governance without waste.  the improvement of well being in our land isn t achieved with political upheaval. it s achieved with work, with the participation of everyone and with dedication,  said guterres.     dwindling output from existing oil and gas fields, compounded by weaker commodities prices, have hit the government s budget and crimped its ambition to develop manufacturing as an engine for economic growth. the former portuguese colony was invaded by neighboring indonesia in 1975. an often violent 24 year resistance movement took east timor to independence in 2002 and many of its key figures still feature prominently in running the country. alkatiri, who is a muslim in the predominantly roman catholic nation, spent several decades living in exile in mozambique during east timor s struggle for independence. nobel peace prize winner and former prime minister and president, jose ramos horta, was also sworn into the cabinet last month in a new post as minister of state and counsellor for national security. hernani filomena coelho da silva has been appointed to the important post of oil minister. he was foreign minister in the previous administration. australia and east timor reached a breakthrough agreement last month on a maritime border, ending a decade old row that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project. the dispute has led the owners of the greater sunrise fields   woodside petroleum, conocophillips, royal dutch shell and japan s osaka gas   to shelve the project. fretilin, which won 23 seats in the election, will join with the democratic party to control 30 seats in the 65 seat parliament.  fretilin, or the revolutionary front for an independent east timor, had been in a de facto coalition since 2015 with the national congress for timorese reconstruction, a party founded by former independence fighter xanana gusmao.

" internal state department instructions to implement president donald trump’s temporary travel ban on citizens of six muslim majority nations help demonstrate that the ban violates the constitution, the american civil liberties union argued in court filings late on thursday. the aclu made the argument as part of its lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california on behalf of three student visa holders against trump’s march 6 executive order barring travelers from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen from entering the united states for 90 days and refugees for four months. the lawsuit, which seeks class action status, says the order discriminates against muslims. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson issued instructions to implement trump’s order in a series of four cables to consular officers worldwide last month, which were first revealed by reuters. the aclu pointed to language from one of the cables that directs consular officers to assess whether applicants from the six countries “found otherwise eligible” for u.s. visas could still be denied visas based on trump’s order. the aclu said the guidance “amounts to an unconstitutional amendment of existing law.” tillerson issued the cable on march 10, and followed it with another set of instructions on march 15, the day before the ban was supposed to go into effect. after federal courts blocked the central tenets of trump’s order, tillerson issued two other cables that rescinded many of his previous instructions but left some tighter visa vetting procedures in place. a state department official declined to comment on the litigation or the cables. the department of justice also declined to comment. the trump administration has said that the travel ban and increased screening of foreigners are crucial to protecting the united states from terrorist attacks. the government is arguing in court that the president has broad authority under the law to make immigration decisions when there are concerns about national security. the march executive order replaced a more sweeping travel ban that trump signed on jan. 27, which sparked chaos and protests at airports and was challenged by more than two dozen lawsuits. the original ban had covered citizens of iraq, as well as the six countries also included in the revised ban. iraq was dropped from the revised order, as was an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria. the revised ban aimed to overcome legal hurdles by excluding legal permanent residents and allowing for waivers for people with ties to the united states. the aclu, in its claims that the order discriminates against muslims, points to calls by trump on the campaign trail for a “muslim ban” and to a speech he made last month calling the new ban a “watered down” version of the first.

"flashback to february 18. 201: in a remarkable dispute just two days before a pivotal republican primary, pope francis said donald trump s plan to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border is un-christian, prompting trump to respond that it was  disgraceful  for the pope to question his religion. a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not christian, francis told reporters wednesday aboard the papal plane. this is not in the gospel. the pope s comments were first made public on thursday. they obviously got to the pope,  trump said.  he doesn t know me   the pope heard only one side of the story. in response to pope francis  comments, candidate trump told his supporters that i am a christian and i am proud of it,  and also attacked the mexican government for  using the pope as a pawn. there can t be a good economy without good businessmen, without their capacity to create and to produce,  he said, shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.the pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful. moreover, only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat, he suggested. the world of work is a human priority,  francis said,  and it s also a priority for the pope. there s always been a friendship between the church and work, starting with jesus, who was a worker. when work is weakened, it s democracy that enters into crisis,  he said.  there s a social compact. without denouncing unemployment benefits, francis insisted that state intervention wasn t a real solution.  a monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn t solve the problem. it has to be resolved with work for everyone,  he said.",1

" u.s. lawmakers are looking to use a defense policy bill to increase restrictions on military aid for pakistan, expressing frustration with what they see as islamabad’s failure to crack down on afghanistan’s militant haqqani network. the $602 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, passed by the house of representatives late on wednesday would block $450 million in aid to islamabad unless it does more to fight the network, which lawmakers see as a major threat to u.s. forces in afghanistan.  the bill requires the pentagon to certify that pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the haqqani network, not letting the network use north waziristan as a safe haven and actively coordinating with afghanistan’s government to fight the network along their border. as they finalized the 2017 version of the annual bill, house members added three amendments related to pakistan. all passed by unanimous voice vote. one added a fourth requirement to the release of the aid, that the administration certify pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting haqqani network senior leaders and mid level operatives. another required that the secretary of defense certify  pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the united states to persecute minority groups. and a third added a “sense of congress” that shakil afridi is an international hero and calls for his immediate release from prison. afridi is a pakistani doctor believed to have helped the cia hunt down osama bin laden. pakistan sentenced afridi in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to a militant group, which he denies. that sentence was overturned and afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge. pakistan says its courts will decide afridi’s fate, and has angrily criticized u.s. politicians, including republican presidential candidate donald trump, over calls to release him. the house version of the ndaa is not the final version of the legislation. it must be combined with a senate bill before being sent to the white house for president barack obama to sign, or veto. however, there is also strong criticism of pakistan in the senate. this month, senator bob corker used his authority as chairman of the foreign relations committee to bar the use of any u.s. funds for pakistan to buy american f 16 fighter jets.

" president barack obama is maintaining pressure on the senate to approve his supreme court nominee, but the need for republican u.s. senators seeking re election to keep conservative voters happy before primary elections in the coming months is working against him. from april 26 to sept. 13, nine states where incumbent republicans’ grip on u.s. senate seats is tenuous will hold party primaries ahead of the nov. 8 congressional and presidential elections. during that period, republicans seem unlikely to break with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell’s hard line stance against holding confirmation hearings or a vote on obama’s nominee, appellate judge merrick garland. mcconnell has insisted that obama’s successor, to be elected in november and take office in january, should fill the vacancy left by february’s death of justice antonin scalia. republicans are hoping their party’s candidate wins the presidency and can make the appointment. a supreme court appointment requires senate confirmation. voicing support for holding garland hearings during the primary season, political experts say, could enrage conservatives already upset over the prospect of obama making a third lifetime appointment to the nine member court, which could give the bench a liberal tilt for the first time in decades. that anger could bolster primary candidates challenging incumbent republicans from the right or encourage new challengers to come forward. political science professor sheldon goldman of the university of massachusetts at amherst, who has tracked supreme court nominations since the 1960s, said of the garland fight: “the real obstacle is getting over the primaries.” the danger of straying from mcconnell’s blockade was illustrated when kansas republican jerry moran last month backed hearings on garland but reversed course after rumblings of a right wing challenge materializing in moran’s aug. 2 primary. other key battlegrounds for senate republicans include wisconsin, pennsylvania, florida and new hampshire. new hampshire’s kelly ayotte is viewed as one of the most vulnerable senate republican incumbents. ayotte will meet with garland but said she wants the senate to wait until after november’s elections to act on the nomination. arizona senator john mccain, facing at least two opponents in his aug. 30 republican primary, downplayed the political difficulties presented by garland’s nomination. he said when he was home during the recent senate recess, he heard few complaints. of his constituents, mccain said, “they would ask. i would explain.” obama and fellow democrats in the senate continue to press republicans to allow hearings by summer. “so what you have here is, i think, a circumstance in which those (republicans) in the senate have decided that ‘placating our base’ is more important than upholding their constitutional and institutional roles in our democracy in a way that is dangerous,” obama said in chicago on thursday. some democrats think mcconnell’s gambit gives them a campaign issue for the elections. dick durbin, the senate’s no. 2 democrat, said, “if there was any question about obstruction in the united states senate, what’s happening with the vacancy on the supreme court is exhibit a of republican obstructionism.” ",0
" tensions are high on the south china sea as vietnam faces off against china over their overlapping maritime claims. but for the boatmen on the junks cruising the calm expanse of vietnam s ha long bay, another growing chinese presence in the region is very welcome indeed.  more than half our tourists are chinese now,  said nguyen van phu, 33, who has spent six years working on the boats that chug between the bay s spectacular stone towers.  if they stopped coming it would be a big problem, if not a disaster.  the number of chinese tourists in vietnam has surged this year, just one sign of the growing economic ties between two long time enemies. chinese investment in vietnam is also increasing rapidly, as is trade between the two countries. but while tourists, trade and investment are being welcomed, they also present a challenge for a fiercely independent country like vietnam, which has been wary of china s growing influence in the region.  the rising economic dependence on china makes it more difficult for vietnam to decide how far to confront china on the south china sea,  said nguyen khac giang, a researcher at the vietnam economics and policy research institution.  vietnam would suffer far more than china economically in the event of political instability given its smaller size, he said. china exports more goods to vietnam than any other country in southeast asia, sending textiles to be made into shirts and sneakers, and electronic components for mobile phones and large flat panel displays. those completed products are exported around the world, as well as back to china.     vietnam also makes electronics components for factories in china, and exports computers for chinese consumers. manufacturers see vietnam as an attractive base, with wages as little as a third of those in coastal regions of china, according to employment consultants. and while proximity has historically been a source of friction between the two countries   they fought a border war as recently as 1979 and armed clashes flared for years afterwards   for manufacturers it s a boon.  we strategically invested in vietnam because of its geographical advantage   closer to china and hence lower cost on materials, transportation and relatively shorter production lead time,  said bosco law, chief executive of the hong kong based lawsgroup. the company makes clothes for brands such as gap, whose global operations include scores of outlets in china. businesses contacted by reuters declined to talk openly about the risks for them of tension between vietnam and china. chinese trade and investment has surged across southeast asia in recent years as companies search out new bases for manufacturing and consumers for their goods.  china has also invested in infrastructure and plans to pour development funds into southeast asia as part of its sprawling belt and road initiative. that has already had a political effect.  big recipients of chinese investment such as cambodia and laos are promoting china s line on the south china sea at regional meetings.  president rodrigo duterte of the philippines, meanwhile, has cited chinese investment pledges as he softens his country s stance on its maritime disputes with china. tensions between beijing and hanoi have been high since mid june, when chinese pressure forced vietnam to suspend oil drilling on a block that overlaps the line china says marks its claim to almost all the south china sea. as vietnam has emerged as the most vocal regional opponent of china s maritime claims in southeast asia, it has drawn beijing s ire. its growing defense links to the united states, japan and india also make china suspicious. the vietnamese government has also had to contend with public pressure at home. a row over chinese oil drilling in disputed waters in the south china sea in 2014 sparked anti china riots in vietnam in which foreign factories thought to be chinese were set on fire, before the rig was removed. tourism dipped in the aftermath, but quickly bounced back. trade has also risen steadily since then.   exports to china jumped nearly 43 percent to $13 billion in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier, according to customs data. imports rose more slowly, climbing 16 percent. chinese tourist arrivals, meanwhile, soared 60 percent to nearly 1.9 million in the first half of 2017 to account for around one third of all foreign visitors. for the most part, the government has welcomed the boost from chinese tourism, as it strives to meet a 6.7 percent target for annual economic growth. vietnam is also welcoming chinese investments, if cautiously.   we should be careful but at the same time we should take advantage,  said nguyen mai, the president of vietnam s association of foreign invested enterprises. the biggest foreign direct investors in vietnam have long been from south korea and japan, particularly in the electronics sector. more than 100,000 vietnamese work for samsung alone in vietnam. however, chinese investment is growing quickly, nearly doubling last year to almost 8 percent of total foreign direct investment. investment went into solar panel and plastics factories, among other areas. direct u.s. investment accounts for about 2 percent of the total so far this year; the united states is also vietnam s second largest trade partner. for a graphic on vietnam china

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump backed off from praising vladimir putin on wednesday, saying he was unsure of his relationship with the russian president who he has described as a better leader than president barack obama. the day after running mate mike pence appeared to break ranks with trump during a vice presidential debate and called putin “a small and bullying leader,” trump adjusted his own previously warm rhetoric toward the russian. “i don’t love (putin), i don’t hate. we’ll see how it works. we’ll see,” trump told supporters during a campaign stop in the swing state of nevada. “maybe we’ll have a good relationship. maybe we’ll have a horrible relationship. maybe we’ll have a relationship right in the middle.” democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has criticized trump, who often praises putin, as being too cozy with the russian leader and questioned the republican’s business interests in russia. those charges were repeated by her vice presidential candidate tim kaine during a debate with pence on tuesday. in response, pence denounced putin for his interference in syria’s civil war and support for syrian president bashar al assad. “the small and bullying leader of russia is now dictating terms to the united states,” pence said. “the greatest nation on earth just withdraws from talks about a ceasefire, while vladimir putin puts a missile defense system in syria.” the vice presidential encounter set the table for a second presidential debate on sunday in st. louis between clinton and trump, who needs to rebound from a rocky performance in his first debate, one that gave clinton a boost in national opinion polls with the nov. 8 election day only five weeks away.         in nevada, trump suggested russia could be a valuable ally in the fight against islamic state, also known by the acronym  isis. “i will say if we get along with russia and russia went out with us and knocked the hell out of isis, that’s okay with me, folks,” he said. trump celebrated a strong debate performance by pence, the governor of indiana, and said his running mate had won on style and on the issues. “he’s getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody,” trump told a group of pastors and leaders gathered at a christian academy in las vegas. the encounter between pence and kaine, a u.s. senator from virginia, was the only such debate between the vice presidential contenders, and the two spent most of their time attacking each other’s running mates. for more than 90 minutes at longwood university in farmville, virginia, pence sought to project an image as a reassuring presence, in contrast with the bombastic trump, while kaine tried to frighten voters away from trump and make clinton seem more trustworthy. a cnn/orc snap poll declared pence the winner with 48 percent support, compared with 42 percent for kaine, who frequently interrupted his opponent. the television audience for the debate was 35.6 million viewers, according to preliminary data, about half the number who watched the first encounter between trump and clinton.     republican strategists said pence’s strong debate performance could provide lessons for trump on how to approach the second debate   if he was willing or able to learn. “trump should hopefully learn a lesson   don’t get angry, don’t lose your cool, answer the question you want to answer,” republican strategist john feehery said. “the biggest thing is to not get rattled and be able to smile when you are attacked.” clinton met with advisers at her washington, d.c., home on wednesday and did not appear on the campaign trail. an aide said she spoke by phone with kaine and congratulated him on his debate performance. “mike pence didn’t want to defend donald trump, and as senator kaine said, if you can’t defend the person at the top of the ticket, how can you ask people to vote for you,” clinton campaign chairman john podesta told reporters outside her house.

" atlantic city, the distressed new jersey gambling hub, should consider privatizing its fire fighting services and convention center and find ways to make more money off its drinking water utility, the city’s emergency manager said in an updated fiscal rescue plan. the report comes one year after governor chris christie appointed kevin lavin as emergency manager. lavin’s report, which also calls for additional layoffs, follows an initial assessment last march.  new jersey taxpayers have so far spent $2.62 million on lavin and his team of accountants, restructuring lawyers and a mediator, according to invoices obtained and reviewed by reuters through public records requests. “i’m glad the emergency manager has, after spending millions of dollars in no bid contracts and wasting months of time, concluded what we all know: that atlantic city government is broken and needs to be fixed immediately,” senate president steve sweeney said in a statement.  sweeney is now pushing for a full state takeover of atlantic city operations that would strip elected officials of nearly all power. lavin said in a statement that over the past year his office and city stakeholders have “kept the city from falling into financial ruin” by tackling a $100 million budget deficit.  “unfortunately, our momentum has been stalled by parochial politics that continue to inhibit progress, all to the detriment of the taxpayers of atlantic city,” he said. “many of the most critical and financially important issues need to be addressed urgently.” he said the city should consider privatizing the entertainment and sports arena boardwalk hall and should regionalize municipal services, including police. the city is facing tough odds. its school district is projecting a budget deficit of up to $55 million in fiscal 2017. atlantic city also has at least $190 million of casino tax appeals and other unbonded debt. in part because of that, the city’s “ability to raise public funds in order to repay the unbonded debt is highly unlikely,” the report said the report found that the city does not qualify for “adequate” financing under the state’s qualified bond act, which it used in the past to issue bonds because its credit rating is at junk status. mayor don guardian said in a statement he would review the report. “i fully recognize that much work still needs to be done to fix the problems that have accumulated over the past 30 years,” he said.

" president barack obama is in excellent health thanks to daily exercise and a good diet, driving his cholesterol level lower than it was a year and a half ago, his doctor said on tuesday. obama, 54, a former smoker, continues to use nicotine gum once in a while and takes medication for occasional acid reflux symptoms, the president’s physician, ronny jackson, said in a memo released by the white house. the results from obama’s physical examination last month showed that his total cholesterol level fell to 188 from 213 in may 2014. his weight dropped to 175 pounds (79 kg) from 180 over that period. obama is 6 feet 1 1/2 inches (1.87 metres) tall. “the president’s overall health remains excellent and is improved from his last formal assessment,” jackson wrote. obama’s last assessment was released in june 2014. “his adherence to a healthy diet and a consistent exercise program has resulted in an improved lean body mass and lower cholesterol level. all clinical data indicates that the president is currently very healthy and that he will remain so for the duration of his presidency.”    obama leaves office in january 2017.

" iran may abandon the nuclear deal it reached with six major powers if the united states decides to withdraw from it, iranian  foreign minister told qatar s al jazeera tv in new york. u.s. president donald trump has called the 2015 deal an  embarrassment . the deal is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran and its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen tensions in the middle east.  if washington decides to pull out of the deal, iran has the option of withdrawal and other options,  al jazeera tv wrote on its twitter feed, quoting mohammad javad zarif.   washington will be in a better position if it remains committed to the deal,  the network quoted zarif as saying. al jazeera deleted an earlier tweet citing zarif as saying that if washington withdrew from the deal iran would do so too, rather than just having the option to do so, after an iranian official said zarif had been misquoted. trump is considering whether the accord serves u.s. security interests. he faces a mid october deadline for certifying that iran is complying with the pact. a state department official said washington would not comment on every statement by an iranian official.  we are fully committed to addressing the totality of iranian threats and malign activities,  the official said. iranian authorities had repeatedly said tehran would not be the first to violate the agreement, under which tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy. the prospect that washington could renege on the deal has worried some of the u.s. allies that helped negotiate it. french president emmanuel macron said last week that there was no alternative to the nuclear accord. if trump, who has called the accord  the worst deal ever negotiated , does not recertify it by oct. 16, congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions suspended under the accord.

" a final assault on islamic state s last line of defense in its former syrian capital raqqa should begin on sunday night, a field commander for the u.s. backed forces operating there said.  the loss of islamic state s remaining streets and buildings in raqqa following its defeat in iraq s mosul this year and its retreat from swathes of territory in both countries, would mark a major milestone in the battle to destroy the jihadist group.  the assault on militants in the center of the northern city will focus on surrounding the sports stadium there, said a field commander in the syrian democratic forces (sdf) in western raqqa, who gave his name as ardal raqqa.  daesh is massing there because this is the last stage. they will resist, or they will surrender or die,  he said.  this their last stand to the death.  islamic state declared a caliphate in 2014 and at the height of its power ruled over millions of people, from northern syria to the outskirts of iraq s capital baghdad, but it has since endured a series of losses under attack from many sides.  raqqa was the group s de facto syrian capital, a center of operations where it oversaw the management of much of eastern, central and northern syria and planned attacks abroad.  now it is hemmed into a small area in the city center that includes the stadium, the national hospital and a roundabout where islamic state once displayed the heads of its enemies.  in the hours before the expected launch of the final assault, which the commander said could take up to a week, the sound of gunfire sporadically rattled around the area near the hospital.  the district had been flattened, with buildings completely gone. coalition jets soared overhead and air strikes pounded at a higher rate than in recent days.  islamic state has lost most of its territory to the sdf, spearheaded by the kurdish ypg militia, and to a rival offensive by syria s army and allied forces this year, and has fallen back on the fertile euphrates valley area downstream of raqqa.     the army and its allies reached the city of deir al zor in september after a months long offensive across the syrian desert, and have since then pushed down the euphrates towards the border with iraq.      on sunday a syrian military source said they had encircled islamic state fighters in the city of al mayadin, one of the jihadists  last strongholds in the area.  units of our armed forces with the allied forces continue their advance on a number of fronts and axes in deir al zor and its countryside... and encircle daesh terrorists in the city of al mayadin,  the military source said.     however, the group has still been able to launch a series of effective counter attacks against the syrian army in the central desert region over the past week, putting pressure on the main supply road to deir al zor from the west.  syrian president bashar al assad is backed in the war by russia, iran and shi ite militias including lebanon s hezbollah, and its campaign against islamic state has mostly been on the west bank of the river.  the u.s. backed sdf campaign has mostly been on the east bank, where raqqa is located, and has also advanced downstream to hold areas opposite deir al zor. the united states and russia have put in place channels to lessen the risk of fighting between the rival offensives they back.  u.s. officials have previously said that islamic state had relocated some of its diminished command and propaganda structures to al mayadin as it was forced from territory elsewhere.     the spokeswoman for the sdf campaign in raqqa, jihan sheikh ahmad, said in a statement on a website for the campaign that it would announce the liberation of raqqa  in the coming few days  after having captured 85 percent of the city.    commanders directing the battle in raqqa have said that islamic state fighters have taken civilian hostages and are using sniper fire, booby traps and tunnels to slow the sdf advance. the sdf began its campaign to isolate raqqa early this year, pushing along several fronts to enclose the city against the euphrates backed by coalition air strikes and special forces.  its attack on the city itself started in june and the fighting left much of raqqa in ruins, as intense air strikes and street to street battles devastated buildings.

" the trump administration on friday dropped a lawsuit accusing north carolina of discriminating against lgbt residents after the state replaced its “bathroom bill”, although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court. in a two sentence court filing the justice department said it had dropped its lawsuit, filed last year by the obama administration, because the north carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called house bill 142. the filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the state’s nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law, known as house bill 2 or more commonly as the “bathroom bill.” house bill 2’s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms, changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity. a number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted north carolina because they saw the year old law as discriminatory against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt) community. civil liberties groups also protested the move. the american civil liberties union, the aclu of north carolina, and lambda legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in march of last year. that was followed in may by the justice department’s own suit against house bill 2. james esseks, the aclu’s lgbt project director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until 2020 and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access. the legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access, he said. house bill 142 “leaves transgender people in limbo and that’s intentional,” esseks said. “this does not fix the problem. it creates confusion.” esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill.

" the united nations plans to move up to 10,000 illegal migrants from libya next year, a senior u.n. official said on tuesday, in a bid to relieve the plight of thousands stranded in deteriorating conditions in detention centers there. libya is the main departure point for migrants fleeing poverty or war to reach europe by boat as smugglers exploit turmoil gripping the country since the 2011 overthrow of muammar gaddafi. illegal migrant arrivals in italy have fallen by two thirds since july from the same period last year since the u.n. backed government in tripoli, italy s partner, cut back human smuggling at one major hub. italy also helps in the libyan coast guard s operations. but activists say the push has led to worsening of conditions in detention centers, where human rights watch and other groups say migrants face overcrowding, abuse, lack of medical facilities and a shortage of food. the u.n. is repatriating migrants to african countries willing to take them back but it was also in talks with european countries and canada to take in some refugees, roberto mignone, chief mission of the u.n. refugee agency, said.  this week we are going to send out of libya 350 refugees, until the end of january we will send out at least 1000,  he told reuters in an interview.  in 2018 we are planning to send out of libya between 5,000 to 10,000 refugees. we give priority to women, children, elderly, disabled, persons who suffered very seriously.  a total of 44,306 had been registered as refugees and asylum seekers in libya, he said. libyan officials deny abuses and say they are simply overwhelmed by a surge in arrivals amid little funds to accommodate them as public finances have been hit by a loss of oil revenues. the issue of repatriations has got higher attention abroad  since cnn published a video showing what it said was an auction of men offered to libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400. in november, libya s u.n. backed government said it was investigating the report and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. but it has struggled to make an impact as the country is effect controlled by armed factions.

" u.s. president donald trump said on monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across asia that saw governments roll out red carpets  like nobody has ever seen .  we ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,  trump told reporters in manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of southeast asian and east asian nations. he did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to japan, south korea, china and vietnam before his last leg in the philippines capital. he said a statement would be issued from the white house on wednesday about north korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful.  it was red carpet like nobody, i think, has probably ever seen,  he said. in vietnam at the weekend, trump and leaders of pacific rim nations agreed to address  unfair trade practices  and  market  distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. his  america first  vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that china now champions. on the sidelines of the vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a trans pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting american jobs. chinese president xi jinping told the summit in vietnam that asia pacific nations must  uphold multilateralism , countering trump s message that the united states would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. trump, by contrast, blasted the world trade organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour. some analysts expect tougher u.s. action may be imminent to fight trade imbalances with china exacerbated by its state led economic model.

" conservative commentators on sunday mistakenly accused reuters of pulling the plug on the final moments of broadcast coverage of republican presidential candidate donald trump’s appearance at a black church this weekend. reuters said it had no role in filming the trump event. cbs news filmed on behalf of a pool of media companies and discontinued the feed in the final moments of trump’s appearance because of the schedule set by the campaign, according to a cbs producer involved. “the detroit trump footage being circulated on twitter and elsewhere was not filmed by reuters,” abbe serphos, reuters global head of communications, said in a statement. despite having no involvement in filming the saturday event, reuters was targeted for criticism by commentators including ann coulter. they were apparently under the false impression that reuters had ordered its camera operator to shut down as trump was receiving a blessing from the pastor. sopan deb, a cbs journalist who was the pool producer for the event at the detroit church, said the decision to cut off the video feed was made because trump campaign staffers were hurrying reporters into a waiting motorcade. “i was the pool producer,” deb said in a tweet. “we were forced to pack up our cameras and leave during this.” cbs news and the trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment on sunday. deb could not be reached for further comment beyond his remarks on twitter. coulter could not be reached. the sudden controversy was fanned by social media and came on the holiday weekend that traditionally marks the start of major campaigning for the nov. 8 election. it followed trump’s visit to a largely black church in detroit on saturday, where he told the crowd his economic agenda would create jobs and educational opportunity for african american voters as part of what he called a “civil rights agenda for our time.” at the end of the nearly hour long saturday morning service at the great faith ministries church, bishop wayne t. jackson draped a prayer shawl over trump to applause from the crowd in the church. “i have prayed over this personally, and i have fasted over it,” jackson said. shortly after trump accepted the shawl, the pool feed used by broadcast networks was cut off as reporters prepared to move to the next campaign event. “how convenient that at one of the compelling moments…(the) satellite feed dropped,” conservative radio talk show host laura ingraham said on twitter. deb, the cbs reporter, said the suggestion of bias was “totally inaccurate.” in a tweet responding to ingraham, he said: “if you want to make this an issue, please take it up with the campaign. we tried to stay and shoot this whole thing.”  ingraham could not be immediately reached for comment. in a point of contention with journalists, trump staffers have sometimes told reporters traveling with the candidate they need to leave events before trump if they want to avoid risking their spot in the group of reporters traveling in the motorcade with the candidate. a video posted on a website affiliated with conservative radio show host alex jones claimed to capture a difference of opinion between the camera operator and a producer on site about whether to continue filming the trump event on saturday. before the video cuts, one person can be heard to say, “i’m shooting this,” and then, almost inaudibly, “i’ll take a demotion.” a second voice says “shut it” and then “blackout,” the site said. reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the offstage audio. “reuters obtained the footage from third party providers and the voices heard on the video are not reuters staff or contractors,” serphos said. trump has criticized media organizations including the washington post, the new york times, cnn and others for what he has claimed are biases in their coverage of his campaign. on the day of his visit to the detroit church, trump lashed out at cnn. “great visit to detroit church, fantastic reception, and all cnn talks about is a small protest outside,” trump said in a tweet.

sanders demanded that trump apologize for  continuing the lie that the president is not an american and not a christian. fox news   hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.it s neither a taliban stronghold outside jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of karachi.it s a place called islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the catskill mountains in upstate new york, about three hours north of manhattan.it s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides new york city with most of its drinking water.quietly nestled in the woods, islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to sept. 11, 2001, when the world trade center and the pentagon were attacked by a determined band of islamic extremists.that s when people started questioning the community s ties to a pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. they also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.but before you leap to conclusions and head to the catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. the truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the sufi cleric sheikh syed mubarik ali shah gilani   a group of primarily black muslims from brooklyn left new york city to escape crime, poverty and racism. aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.and they weren t alone. other groups, also inspired by gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. according to the group s own web site, the islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.according to locals, the land previously belonged to a deposit, n.y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.the group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the port authority in new york city (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).in the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. there was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.watch video here:there was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. they broke my nephew s nose,  said a hancock, n.y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.another man said the muslim boys  trashed  the school in deposit.locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.according to joy felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the muslims. we had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the muslim community,  felber said.  it was lack of knowledge. when people don t know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. and you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly. after a further controversy about whether the islamberg boys should have been going to public school in deposit or hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it s technically in deposit, hancock or nearby tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the muslim community drew away from town life.all islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.",1

" former republican u.s. president george w. bush diverged sharply from donald trump’s new administration on monday, saying he supported a welcoming immigration policy and praising the media as “indispensable to democracy.” in a wide ranging interview with nbc’s “today” show, bush also said he did not know if a special prosecutors was needed to investigate contacts between trump associates and russia but added, “we all need answers.” bush, in some of his first televised comments since trump took office, was asked if he had seen signs that trump was trying to close the rift in the u.s. electorate after his divisive campaign against democrat hillary clinton. he acknowledged that his own presidency from 2001 to 2009 began after a contentious election but that it was “hard to compare times.” he said that trump is still in the early stage of his presidency and that americans have “got to take the man at his word.” asked whether he supported trump’s travel ban on people from seven majority muslim countries, bush said, “i am for an immigration policy that is welcoming and that upholds the law.” bush, whose presidency was shaped by the sept. 11, 2001, al qaeda attacks on america, also called for religious tolerance. “one of our great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or not worship at all,” he said. after the attacks, bush had made a point of supporting muslims and praising islam’s teachings as peaceful.  trump has branded some news outlets as “the enemy of the people” but bush said: “i consider the media to be indispensable to democracy, that we need an independent media to hold people like me to account,” he said. “it’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power.” he said that during his presidency he tried to persuade  russian president vladimir putin to accept the concept of an independent news media. “it’s kind of hard to tell others to have an independent, free press and we’re not willing to have one ourselves,” bush told nbc. trump, the first republican president since bush left office, won the november presidential election after besting 16 other republican candidates for the party’s nomination, including bush’s brother jeb. his victory came amid lukewarm backing from establishment wing of the party as prominent republicans, including bush and his father, former president george h.w. bush, shunned him or offered lukewarm support.

" a california republican state lawmaker is challenging the legality of a move by democrats in the legislature to hire former u.s. attorney general eric holder to help in any legal battles with president elect donald trump’s administration. assembly member kevin kiley has requested a formal ruling from state lawyers on whether the decision by democratic legislative leaders to hire holder and his firm, covington & burling, for $25,000 a month violated a provision in the state’s constitution that bans hiring outside counsel for work the state’s own lawyers can do. “people might have differing feelings about eric holder and about the incoming presidential administration, but all of us should be able to agree that as legislators we have a duty to abide by the law,” kiley, an attorney, said in a phone interview on monday. kiley’s request came on the eve of hearings in the democratic led legislature on the nomination of u.s. representative xavier becerra as state attorney general, another move by democrats to position california to defend its liberal policies against the republican trump. america’s most populous state voted heavily for democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 presidential election. under the trump administration, which takes office on jan. 20, california is expected to take a role similar to that played by texas, kansas and other conservative states during democratic president barack obama’s administration. those states mounted legal challenges to obama’s executive orders and federal policies on such issues as healthcare, immigration and the environment. california republicans have been mostly quiet on democratic governor jerry brown’s nomination of becerra. but the hiring of holder, who was obama’s attorney general from 2009 to 2015, prompted an outpouring of protest from republican lawmakers. “democrats should focus on solving these real world problems instead of wasting tax payer money to score political points before the president elect even takes office,” assembly republican leader chad mayes said in a statement.  kevin liao, a spokesman for democratic state assembly speaker anthony rendon said on monday his office had conferred with the state legislative counsel and other legal sources before hiring holder’s firm. he disagreed the hiring was prohibited, saying the constitutional ban referred to hiring by the executive branch of government and not the legislature. liao added that legislature needed legal advice from attorneys experienced in dealing with federal agencies and federal law   cases in which the state attorney general’s office does not specialize.

" russia s communications regulator on friday accused u.s. tv channel cnn international of violating russian media law and said it had summoned the broadcaster s representatives in connection with the matter. the russian foreign ministry accused washington on thursday of putting unwarranted pressure on the u.s operations of kremlin backed media outlet rt, and warned that moscow could take tit for tat measures. president vladimir putin told a meeting of russia s security council on friday that russian media outlets working abroad were facing growing and unacceptable pressure, his spokesman dmitry peskov said. the communications regulator, roskomnadzor, said in a statement on its website that it would look at warning cnn about the alleged violations, which it said also breached the terms of its broadcast license. it did not say what breaches of russian laws the u.s. broadcaster had made, adding it would continue its  systematic monitoring  of foreign mass media outlets registered in russia. asked if the regulator s move was politically motivated, roskomnadzor head alexander zharov, was quoted by interfax news agency as saying:  i don t work in a political agency. i work in a regulatory service.   russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said on thursday the u.s. authorities were demanding that russian state controlled broadcaster russia today (rt) be registered as a  foreign agent  in the united states. she said that move endangered the safety of the channel s staff, because it included an obligation to disclose their personal data.  in the atmosphere of a witch hunt unfolding in the united states, this may present a real threat,  she said. putin, meeting permanent members of his security council,  touched upon the issue of ongoing and at times growing pressure on russian mass media outlets in some foreign countries , peskov told a conference call with reporters.  it was stressed that such pressure on russian media is unacceptable,  he added. he did not name the countries where the kremlin was concerned russian media were coming under pressure.    the foreign ministry s zakharova said any move made against russian media working in the united states  will get a tit for tat response .  and who it falls on, this should be easy for washington to work out. the clock is ticking,  she said at a weekly briefing on thursday.

" mexicans  positive image of the united states has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2002, with about two thirds of people viewing the country led by president donald trump unfavorably, according to a poll released on thursday.  the u.s. based pew research center s findings reveal a drastic about face in mexicans  views of their northern neighbor. in 2015, 66 percent had a positive view of the united states. by 2017, 65 percent of people disapproved of the world s top economy, pew said.  unsurprisingly, few mexicans approve of trump s proposed border wall, with 94 percent of people opposing it. but mexicans also fret about trump s international footprint.   only 5 percent have confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs, trump s lowest rating among 37 nations polled in 2017,  according to the poll. the survey is also grim reading for mexican president enrique pena nieto, his ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) and the rest of mexico s political class, less than a year before voters pick a new president in july. mexicans  favorable view of pena nieto has steadily fallen since pew began measuring it in 2011, dropping from 61 percent six years ago to his current level of 28 percent. an often large majority disapproves of how pena nieto has handled issues like the economy, graft, crime and u.s. relations, pew said.  the pri was the most unfavorably viewed of the parties polled by pew, with the conservative national action party enjoying the most positive views, albeit with relatively high negative perceptions. the leftist national regeneration movement (morena), led by current presidential front runner andres manuel lopez obrador, was the second most positively viewed party, and also the least badly perceived.  the vast majority   85 percent   of mexicans are unhappy with the way things are going in their country. seventy percent of mexicans believe the economy is going badly, with 35 percent saying the economy is going very badly. mexicans  main concerns are crime, political graft and drug violence, pew found. anxieties over those three issues had all risen compared with the finding in 2015.  although mexicans harbor increasingly negative views of the united states, 55 percent said those that move north enjoy a better life, up from 2015. however, only 13 percent of people said they would live and work in the united states illegally, down from 20 percent in 2015. the survey was based on 1,000 face to face interviews in mexico between march 2 and april 17, with a margin of error of 4.4 percent.

" the united states is expected to impose sanctions on multiple iranian entities as early as friday following tehran’s recent ballistic missile test, but in a way that will not violate the 2015 iran nuclear deal, sources familiar with the matter said on thursday. one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about eight iranian entities were to be sanctioned, or “designated” in u.s. legal jargon, for terrorism related activities and about 17 for ballistic missile related activities under separate existing u.s. executive orders. the source declined to name the entities. the sources said the new sanctions had been in the works for some time and that iran’s decision to test fire a ballistic missile on sunday had helped to trigger u.s. president donald trump’s decision to impose them. the white house signaled a newly aggressive stance toward iran on wednesday when michael flynn, trump’s national security adviser, made a statement putting iran “on notice” for test firing the missile and senior u.s. officials said the administration was reviewing how to respond. the new sanctions may be the leading edge of a tougher policy but the sources stressed that the united states was imposing them in a manner so as not to conflict with the 2015 iran nuclear deal under which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. trump said earlier on thursday that “nothing is off the table” in dealing with iran following the missile launch, and his fellow republicans in congress said they would back him up with new sanctions. trump’s comment was in response to a question about whether he would consider military options to respond to tehran, a day after flynn’s comment about putting iran “on notice.” the sanctions are not likely to have much, if any, practical effect on the iranian entities or on u.s. companies or individuals who are, with few exceptions, barred from dealing with iran. the sanctions are to be imposed under executive order 13224, which freezes the u.s. assets of entities or individuals who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, and executive order 13382, which freezes the assets of weapons of mass destruction proliferators or their supporters. given the long history of u.s. sanctions against tehran dating to the 1979 islamic revolution, there are unlikely to be any assets under u.s. jurisdiction to be blocked. however, the sanctions could have the effect of dissuading foreign companies from dealing with the iranian entities who are designated, said brookings institution analyst robert einhorn. spokespeople for the white house, the state department and the treasury department had no immediate comment.

" a british activist critical of hong kong s rights record was barred entry to the former british colony on wednesday, prompting a demand from london for an explanation, a week before a communist party leadership meeting starts in beijing. benedict rogers, a co founder of the conservative party s human rights commission, has been a vocal critic of chinese ruled hong kong s treatment of human rights activists, including that of jailed student protest leader joshua wong. after arriving from bangkok on wednesday, rogers said immigration officials who were  perfectly friendly and polite  took him into a room and briefly asked him non sensitive questions.  they denied him entry about an hour later without giving a reason, rogers told reuters over the phone. he was then escorted on to the next flight to bangkok by half a dozen officials. hong kong, which returned to chinese rule in 1997, is governed under a  one country, two systems  principle that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  but critics have accused the government of bending to the will of communist party leaders in beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest. the immigration department said in a statement it does not comment on individual cases, adding it decides whether entry will be allowed  in accordance with the hong kong law and prevailing immigration policies .     the city s leader, carrie lam, also said she would not comment on individual cases when asked about it at a press conference about her maiden policy address. british foreign secretary boris johnson said london needed an explanation from hong kong and beijing.  i am very concerned that a uk national has been denied entry to hong kong. the british government will be seeking an urgent explanation from the hong kong authorities and from the chinese government,  he said in a statement.  hong kong s high degree of autonomy, and its rights and freedoms, are central to its way of life and should be fully respected.  hong kong has, on occasion, barred entry to dissidents, including former leaders of the 1989 tiananmen square protests in beijing and a dutch sculptor who made a tiananmen sculpture, though other tiananmen activists have been allowed in for short visits. rogers said he was  shocked  but he had been prepared because two days ago he had received, through an intermediary, a series of messages from the chinese embassy in london expressing displeasure with his visit.  they actually described me, to my amazement, as a  grave threat to china british relations ,  rogers said.  rogers said the embassy had also become aware of his private discussions with others on the possibility of visiting wong, leader of the 2014 pro democracy protests that brought much of hong kong to a standstill for weeks, in prison, even though the plan fell through. he said a few messages relayed to him via the intermediary subsequently became more threatening, though they were not physically threatening.   i m also shocked because one aspect of  one country, two systems  is hong kong people governing hong kong,  rogers said.   but this decision was not made in hong kong. this decision was from the chinese government. this raises serious questions about that particular aspect of  one country, two systems .  the chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. china s communist party holds a key party congress this month, a five yearly event at which president xi jinping is expected to tighten his grip on power.

" hurricane irma, a deadly, devastating force of nature, rapidly coalesced from a low pressure blip west of africa into one of the most powerful atlantic storms on record, following an unhindered atmospheric path and fed by unusually warm seas. a combination of many factors, experts said on friday, set the stage for irma s formation and helped the storm achieve its full thermodynamic potential, creating the monster tropical cyclone that wreaked havoc on the eastern caribbean and may inflict widespread damage on florida.  it got lucky,  said john knaff, a meteorologist and physical scientist for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa).  this storm is in the goldilocks environment for a major hurricane. it s bad luck for whoever is in its path, but that s what going on here.  brian kahn, an atmospheric scientist and cloud specialist for nasa s jet propulsion laboratory, called the ocean conditions that spawned irma  absolutely ideal.  balmy water temperatures along irma s trajectory ran deep beneath the surface and slightly higher than normal, by as much as a degree fahrenheit in places, providing ample fuel for the storm s development, scientists said. irma also encountered little if any interference in the form of wind shear   sudden changes in vertical wind velocity that can blunt a storm s intensity   as it advanced at about 10 to 18 miles per hour, an ideal pace for hurricanes. its fortuitous path of least resistance was essentially ordained by a well placed atmospheric ridge of high pressure that steered the storm by happenstance through some of the caribbean s warmest waters as well as an area mostly devoid of wind shear. the result was a gargantuan storm that rapidly grew to a category 5, the top of the saffir simpson scale of hurricane strength, with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, the most forceful ever documented in the open atlantic. it also ranks as one of just five atlantic hurricanes known to have achieved such wind speeds during the past 82 years. irma lashed cuba and the bahamas as it drove toward florida on friday after hitting the eastern caribbean with its tree snapping winds, torrential rains and pounding surf, killing at least 21 people and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. by friday night, irma s winds had diminished to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) and it was downgraded to a category 4 storm, though still considered extremely dangerous. the tiny islands directly crossed by irma, like barbuda and st. martin, did little to weaken it, but the storm s intensity could be measurably diminished by a close encounter with a larger land mass, such as cuba, en route to the u.s. mainland, scientists said. so powerful is irma that it may end up dampening another category 4 storm in its wake, hurricane jose, which like irma originated off the west coast of africa and was following a similar course. waters already plied by irma could be left a bit cooler, robbing jose of potential energy, and  outflows  from irma could produce wind shear for jose, said scott braun, a research meteorologist for nasa s goddard space flight center. knaff said it was no surprise that the advent of irma coincided with the precise peak of the atlantic hurricane season. much less certain is the role of global climate from human induced atmospheric increases in heat trapping  greenhouse  gases, scientists said. there is consensus that climate change has raised sea levels, which is likely to exacerbate hurricane storm surges. rising ocean temperatures have been clearly documented as well. research is divided on whether global warming will make tropical cyclones more frequent, though data from climate modeling suggests a higher probability for stronger, wetter hurricanes in the atlantic when they do occur, said tom knutson, a climate research scientist for noaa.  we think, based on model simulations that climate change is having an effect, making storms slightly more intense with higher rainfall rates, but these changes are not huge and we cannot yet clearly detect them in observations,  he said.

" donald trump, who often says he only likes winners, tells one grand tale of loss: in 1990, he nearly went bankrupt and was forced to ask dozens of banks to whom he owed money to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts. it was, the real estate developer admits in his 1997 book “the art of the comeback,” the darkest period of his professional life. in his telling, it’s a story of redemption, of resilience, and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking. six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection, raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of trump’s supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the united states on nov. 8. on the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator. trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans. “that decision was perhaps the smartest thing i did,” he wrote. the six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasn’t based on any overture trump initiated with the banks   and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks, not trump.  three of the participants say trump didn’t acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books, realized he was on the brink of collapse, and summoned him for debt restructuring talks.  while much has been written about trump’s financial troubles at the time, there has been little examination of his description of the bank negotiations in “the art of the comeback,” including his assertion that he chose to initiate those talks. trump’s spokeswoman, hope hicks, declined to comment for this story. following the u.s. stock market crash of 1987, a global recession hit new york real estate. new construction stalled, and several big developers declared bankruptcy.  as the real estate market slumped, trump ran out of cash. at the beginning of 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to more than 70 banks, with $800 million personally guaranteed by his own assets, according to alan pomerantz, a lawyer whose team led negotiations between trump and 72 banks to restructure trump’s loans. pomerantz was hired by citibank but became lead counsel for the negotiations. at the time, trump was not considered a major developer, but he was a new york celebrity. his affair with the actress marla maples and his divorce from his first wife ivana trump made national news headlines, and his first book, “the art of the deal,” was a bestseller. he didn’t have a large portfolio of real estate in new york, with the notable exceptions of his 5th avenue building, trump tower, completed in 1983, and the plaza hotel, which he bought in 1988 after borrowing heavily from citibank. he also owned three casinos in atlantic city, having made a financial bet that he could revive the east coast gambling destination. and in 1989 he added part of an airline to his portfolio, again turning to citibank for a loan to help finance the acquisition of bankrupt eastern airlines shuttle. he turned it into trump shuttle. in 1989, in response to growing concerns about the economic downturn, the federal reserve began asking big banks to review their exposure to the sinking real estate market. at the beginning of 1990, a credit specialist at one of trump’s biggest lenders decided to take a look at the bank’s book of loans to him. the decision was prompted in part by the fed’s questions, as well as concerns within the bank about its exposure to the real estate market. the credit specialist, who did not want to be identified, concluded at the time that trump was “about to go into bankruptcy.”  “the banks were onto the problem before he was onto the problem,” the specialist told reuters. pomerantz said some of the banks became aware of the magnitude of trump’s financial problems when, on a single day, he drew down every cent of a $100 million line of credit one of the banks, banker’s trust, which was purchased by deutsche bank in 1999, had given him to meet his obligations. reuters was unable to independently confirm this. “he did not come to the banks and say ‘i have a problem.’ that did not happen,” said pomerantz. pomerantz, who says he is not a member of any political party, argued in an opinion piece in the wall street journal that trump’s record in real estate was not a good way to measure whether or not he would be a good president.  in “the art of the comeback,” trump says he began loan workout talks in march 1990 when he informed his bankers he might miss a payment on his casino debts.  “if i had waited just six months longer to renegotiate terms with the banks, i might have lost everything,” he wrote. “i would have had to stand in line with a whole bunch of other moguls who were trying to do the same thing.” soon, in boardrooms of banks and law firms around manhattan, trump’s deputies and lawyers began a series of meetings with representatives of the 72 banks, which had billions in outstanding loans, according to pomerantz. during the same period, trump was separately renegotiating a series of loans on his atlantic city casinos. one of the bankers involved in those negotiations, ben berzin, said trump seemed unaware of the depths of his financial troubles even after the banks had stepped in.  “there was a period during these negotiations when he was still spending money like a drunken sailor,” berzin said, recalling the uproar among the bankers when, in a tv interview in the summer of 1991, trump displayed a large diamond engagement ring he had given maples. media reports said the ring cost $250,000, and pomerantz said the bankers complained about it to trump in their next meeting. at one point, trump invited all of the bankers to a broadway show that maples had a role in, according to berzin and a banker who took part in the larger talks with the 72 banks. both said they believed trump was trying to curry favor to win better terms in the workouts. berzin attended the show but the other banker did not. trump described berzin in “the art of the comeback” as a “jerk” who would “scream at people at the top of his lungs about nonsense.” berzin said he was irritated by trump’s characterization and denied ever raising his voice in a meeting. in his book, trump says he told representatives of the 72 banks he would declare bankruptcy and “tie you guys up for years” in the proceedings unless they staked him $65 million to keep his businesses running until the real estate market recovered. he also wanted them to agree to defer all loan payments until that time.   “the banks more than capitulated   they enthusiastically agreed to my proposal,” trump wrote. the bankers and lawyers interviewed dispute this. though it was true that a personal bankruptcy would have made it harder for the banks to collect what trump owed them, he had little leverage in the talks, they said. he, too, would have been seriously hurt in a bankruptcy, especially since he had personally guaranteed so much of what he had borrowed. in pomerantz’s analysis, he would have been able to hold on to little else beyond his home and his pension plan. during the 18 month process of negotiations and asset sales, trump also asked for more time to develop his business ideas, like his plan to turn hotel rooms at the plaza hotel into condominiums, according to one of the bankers, who declined to be identified. that proposal was vetoed. while he did receive a $450,000 a month allowance from the banks to keep his business operations going, it was structured and executed on the banks’ terms, several of the negotiators said. the banks decided they could recover more of the $4 billion they were collectively owed if they sold trump’s holdings one by one, waiting until the market recovered, rather than taking possession of the assets, four participants in the talks said.  these individuals said the banks agreed to forgive trump’s personal liabilities in exchange for his help in selling the properties. the proceeds of the sales would then be split among the banks. trump agreed that the banks could take away all his personal property, including his beloved florida estate, mar a lago, if he failed to execute the agreement. “we had to be sure he would pay attention,” pomerantz said of the liens on trump’s personal holdings. “we would meet with him every friday morning. he was under very strict restrictions by the banks.”  trump worked with the bankers to sell his assets, even when he disagreed about the timing of the sales, most notably when citibank eventually sold the plaza. the banks did not recover 100

" u.s. president donald trump’s commission to investigate possible election fraud on monday put a freeze on its effort to collect sensitive voter data from states in the face of growing legal challenges. in an email, the panel’s designated officer, andrew kossack, asked state elections officers to “hold on submitting any data,” the commission said in court filings.  several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the electronic privacy information center (epic), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. earlier on monday, the american civil liberties union sued the presidential advisory commission on election integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. the bipartisan panel, led by vice president mike pence and kansas secretary of state kris kobach, asked the 50 u.s. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters’ social security numbers.  most u.s. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  “this has been a misadventure from the get go,” massachusetts secretary of state william galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. in wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including social security numbers or birth dates.  “we’re just putting everything on hold,” said reid magney, spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission. arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of secretary of state mark martin, in a court document, the government said it would not download the information from arkansas and would instead delete it. representatives for the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         the commission last week said it would meet on july 19 in washington near the white house. on monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data. “the commission has effectively conceded,” epic president marc rotenberg said by phone. state officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by trump.  the republican president created the panel in may following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

" two journalists from myanmar, who had been detained in bangladesh while reporting on the influx of thousands of rohingya muslims, have been released on bail, a police official said on saturday. the journalists, minzayar oo and hkun lat, were detained in early september in the cox s bazar border region of bangladesh, where refugees are arriving from myanmar to escape a military offensive against insurgents.   a court granted them bail, but they can t go back to their country now,  police official ranajit kumar barua, told reuters by telephone, adding that the court would decide whether the two could leave the country at a separate hearing which may take place sometime in the next week. the two were arrested for violating immigration laws, but no charge sheet against the two has been filed yet, said barua, denying reports that the two had been charged with espionage activities.  a lawyer for the two journalists also confirmed their release, but did not provide any further detail.   bangladesh police had said that the pair were detained for engaging in journalistic work for a german magazine, while on tourist visas. some 429,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered a myanmar army crackdown in response. germany s geo magazine, which had assigned minzayar oo to cover the rohingya crisis, said he had traveled to bangladesh on sept. 6, and was detained the next day. minzayar oo is one of myanmar s most prominent photographers and has worked for various media outlets, covering the country s emergence from military rule. he has previously worked as a contractor with reuters.  hkun lat is also a well known photographer in myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions.

" former u.s. presidential candidate mitt romney attacked 2016 republican front runner donald trump as “a fraud” on thursday and urged primary voters to keep the outspoken new york billionaire from getting the nomination, paving the way for possible horse trading at a party convention in july. in an unusually harsh speech, party elder romney warned that former reality tv star trump would likely lose to possible democratic candidate hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election if he becomes the republican nominee. trump’s rise has split the republican party between mainstream figures like romney, and trump supporters who complain the party does not reflect their concerns about illegal immigration, the slow economic recovery and what they see as america’s diminishing role in the world. that split widened when romney, the party nominee in 2012,  urged republican primary voters to vote tactically in different states to back trump’s opponents and block his path to the nomination. “here’s what i know. donald trump is a phony, a fraud,” said romney, 68, who did not endorse any candidate.  “i would vote for marco rubio in florida, for john kasich in ohio, and for ted cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating mr. trump in a given state,” he said. rubio is a u.s. senator from florida and kasich is the ohio governor. by calling for targeted voting, romney was setting up the possibility of a contested convention when republicans gather in cleveland in mid july to select their nominee for the november election to succeed democratic president barack obama. that could create a pathway to deny trump the 1,237 delegates needed for nomination. the last republican convention to go beyond one ballot was  in 1948 when thomas dewey was nominated. “i think the governor is just being realistic about where things stand and advocating a potential strategy that could stop the trump nomination,” said former romney spokesman ryan williams. republican strategist scott reed said he doubted the last ditch tactical voting suggestion would work. “no one will be playing the targeted voting game. there’s too much anger and distrust,” reed said. trump, 69, has made his party’s establishment uneasy with his abrasive tone and policy positions, including plans to build a wall on the u.s. mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar muslims from entering the country. more than 90 republican national security leaders have signed a scathing open letter opposing trump and his stance on many foreign policy issues.     romney’s speech in utah was the spearhead of a mainstream republican attempt to rein in trump after he won most states in this week’s republican super tuesday nominating contests and took a step toward earning the nomination.  the address came hours before trump and his rivals shared a stage in detroit at 9 p.m. est for a debate hosted by fox news.  trump leads many polls for primaries in the remaining states, including in major ones like florida on march 15, dampening prospects of derailing him. the party establishment’s strategy risks backfiring by further energizing trump’s supporters, many of them white, blue collar voters. “if only romney talked like this four years ago about obama ... or trump,” conservative political commentator michelle malkin said on twitter. “too freaking late and too freaking lame.” trump dismissed the former massachusetts governor who lost to obama four years ago. “mitt is a failed candidate. he failed. he failed horribly. he failed badly,” trump told a rally in maine.        romney decided on his own to give the speech, which he wrote himself. romney said trump’s economic policy would sink america “into prolonged recession,” mocked trump’s ego, and called him a “con man.” “a business genius he is not,” romney said. david axelrod, a former senior adviser to obama, called the romney speech a “break glass” moment he had not seen since 1964, when republicans abandoned their candidate barry goldwater. axelrod noted thousands of republicans had already voted for trump in primary elections. “i wonder about tactic of calling them fools,” axelrod wrote on twitter.

" myanmar police said on tuesday they would drop pending charges against two journalists working for turkey s state broadcaster, their interpreter and driver, who were jailed in november for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone. cameraman lau hon meng from singapore, reporter mok choy lin from malaysia, aung naing soe   a local journalist who was interpreting for the pair   and driver hla tin were detained by police on oct. 27 near myanmar s parliament building in the capital naypyitaw. they are currently each serving a two month prison sentence under a colonial era aircraft law, but all four still face further charges for importing the drone. the two foreign nationals have also been charged with an immigration offence. police lieutenant tun tun win and an immigration officer   the complainants   appeared in a naypyitaw courtroom on tuesday and asked that the court drop the charges. tun tun win told reuters higher police officials had ordered the case dropped because the four did not mean to endanger national security by flying the drone. additionally, he said, the decision was intended  to forward the relationship between countries , referring to the two journalists  home countries, singapore and malaysia. a law officer   the government s prosecutor in the case   was expected to tell the court the charges were formally dropped in another hearing set for thursday, defense lawyer khin maung zaw told reuters.  the higher authorities already instructed to terminate with good intention, but the procedure can only be accomplished on that day (thursday),  the lawyer said. the four are set to complete their sentences under the aircraft act on jan. 9, but may be released earlier for good behavior, he added. the case had raised concerns over freedom of the press in myanmar, where a civilian government led by nobel laureate aung san suu kyi took power last year but the military retains control of security matters, including the police. two reuters journalists were arrested on dec. 12 after they went to meet police officers for dinner on the outskirts of myanmar s largest city yangon. wa lone, 31, and kyaw soe oo, 27, have now been in detention for two weeks with no access to visitors or to a lawyer.  they had covered the crisis in western rakhine state that has driven 655,000 stateless rohingya muslims across the border to bangladesh since august. the reporters are being investigated under the colonial era official secrets act.

" u.s. presidential candidate ted cruz made a plea to the california republican party on saturday to line up behind him in the state’s june primary in his uphill battle to stop front runner donald trump from grabbing the nomination. at the same party convention that was the backdrop for chaotic protests against trump on friday, cruz tried to woo party members with support for their long time issues, such as lower taxes and a harder line on immigration. former california governor pete wilson gave cruz his endorsement as he introduced the senator from texas. cruz received more applause at the convention than either trump or third place candidate ohio governor john kasich, who also spoke on friday.   “if we’re fractured and we’re divided, hillary clinton wins and the campaign is lost,” he said, referring to the democratic party’s front runner in the nov. 8 election for the white house.  now mathematically eliminated from securing the nomination on the first ballot at the party’s convention in cleveland in july, cruz aims to stop trump from receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, forcing a contested convention.  however, the prospect of him being able to do so has grown increasingly slim. trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality tv star, has continued to notch up wins in the nation’s nominating contests, including a five state sweep of the latest string of contests last tuesday.   cruz has downplayed the severity of the losses and in his speech saturday looked forward to upcoming contests, which he has said will put him on the path to thwarting trump. “california is going to decide this republican primary,” he said, referring to the state’s june 7 contest. trump has been at odds with the party’s establishment and has called the system for nominating its candidate “rigged.”  critics say he has played on the fears of his supporters, especially about immigration, by proposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the country and accusing illegal mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals. on thursday and friday, anti trump protests erupted outside the candidate’s california events. on friday, he was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside. cruz hopes to slow trump’s march toward the nomination in indiana’s primary on tuesday. the state awards its 57 delegates on a winner take all basis by congressional district, possibly granting cruz a windfall of pledged delegates.  a real clear politics polling aggregation in the state shows cruz just behind trump, 35.2 percent to 37.5 percent.  polls show cruz has more of a challenge in delegate rich california, where he lags trump 28.3 percent to 45.7 percent.    in an indication of efforts to court the state, cruz on wednesday made the unusual move of naming a vice presidential running mate, onetime presidential hopeful carly fiorina, who was formerly a chief executive of the california technology company hewlett packard co.  on saturday night, she urged the crowd of party faithful, many of whom had backed her as the party’s nominee in a failed bid for u.s. senate in 2010, to join her in supporting cruz. in a dynamic and combative speech, she urged kasich to get out of the race, and challenged the idea that trump had locked up the nomination. “donald trump was here yesterday and he was telling you it’s over,” fiorina said. “but the 30 yard line ain’t a touchdown.”      ",0
" u.s. president barack obama met with a frequent critic, house speaker paul ryan, on tuesday as the political leaders searched for areas where they may be able to overcome partisan divisions. the oval office discussion was the democratic president’s first formal face to face meeting with ryan since the wisconsin congressman took over the top post in the republican dominated house of representatives in october. following the meeting, which was closed to the press, the two ate lunch together in the white house. the session marked a rare public detente between obama and ryan, who have repeatedly clashed over issues such as gun control and immigration reform. the get together in the obama’s office also included the republican controlled senate’s majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. while the leaders said they hoped to find common ground, there were already signs on tuesday that compromise might be elusive. sniping between the administration and the republicans resumed just hours after the meeting, as white house chief of staff denis mcdonough slammed republicans’ latest attempt to overturn the affordable care act. “groundhog’s day is great for a movie plot, not a legislative strategy,” mcdonough said on twitter in response to a post from ryan’s account. “groundhog day” is a 1993 movie about a man who relives the same day over and over again.   during the meeting obama urged actions in areas where republicans had signaled some support, including ratifying the trans pacific partnership trade deal, providing tools to help address puerto rico’s fiscal crisis and advancing cancer treatment. mcconnell told reporters after the meeting that he had “some problems” with the trade pact and said he thought it should not be pursued before the november u.s. presidential election.    ryan also raised concerns about the trade deal, his office said in a statement. white house spokesman josh earnest said after the meeting that the administration does not have a specific timeline for congress to act on the trade agreement, but lawmakers should act “quickly” once the pact is ready for consideration. the leaders also discussed taking action to combat opioid addiction, criminal justice reform and the fight against the zika virus.  obama was pleased to meet with the republican leaders, earnest told reporters.     despite the divisiveness seen on the campaign trail, “it actually is possible for leading republicans to sit down in the same office with a leading democrat and have a conversation about the priorities of the country,” he said.

" former u.s. house of representative speaker dennis hastert has been released from prison in minnesota and moved to a chicago halfway house after serving a 13 month sentence for a financial crime tied to sex abuse, federal records showed on tuesday. the 75 year old was sentenced to 15 months at the federal medical center in rochester, minnesota in april 2016 for banking violations that revealed he sexually abused teenage boys while coaching wrestling at a high school in yorkville, illinois in the 1960s and 1970s. he is scheduled to be held at a residential re entry facility office in chicago until aug. 16, according to federal bureau of prisons records on tuesday. the records did not make clear when hastert had been transferred and officials did not immediately respond to a call for comment. hastert, the longest serving republican house speaker in history, pleaded guilty in 2015 to the crime of structuring, which is a form of money laundering that involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection. the lawmaker was taking the money out of his bank accounts to pay a promised $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering to one of his five sexual abuse victims of wrestlers he coached, he admitted in his plea agreement and at his sentencing hearing.  he was never charged with sex abuse, because the statute of limitations on his alleged crimes had expired. at the time of sentencing, u.s. district judge thomas durkin said he would have given him a longer sentence if it had not been for his age and poor health.

" romania s ruling social democrats have filed a slew of new changes to the criminal code that would decriminalize several graft offences, including some abuse of office crimes, their second attempt this year to weaken a crackdown on corruption. transparency international ranks romania as one of the european union s most corrupt states and brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring, although it has praised magistrates for their efforts to root out high level graft. a draft bill released on tuesday showed a group of social democrat lawmakers are proposing that abuse of office offences that cause financial damage of less than 200,000 euros ($237,100) should no longer be punishable. other changes include serving prison sentences of less than three years at home, lower sentences for bribe taking and other graft crimes, as well as decriminalizing taking a bribe for someone other than the accused. another proposal would make using one s position to obtain sexual favors no longer a crime.  if approved, the changes would put an end to an ongoing trial of social democrat party leader and lower house speaker liviu dragnea, who is accused of abuse of office.  dozens of lawmakers and mayors across all parties stand to benefit from the changes. romania s anti corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006.  a similar attempt to decriminalize some abuse of office crimes triggered the country s largest street protests in decades at the start of 2017. the ruling coalition backed down at the time but has revived the proposals. earlier this month, the ruling coalition has used its overwhelming parliament majority to approve a judicial overhaul that puts magistrates under political control. they have also filed a different set of proposals to change the criminal code that could derail law and order. thousands of magistrates, centrist president klaus iohannis, the european commission, the u.s. state department and seven eu states have all criticized both the approved bills and the criminal code proposals. the social democrats and their junior coalition partner alde have denied the changes would affect the independence of the judiciary and have stressed that parliament has the right to legislate however it sees fit. the proposed changes place romania alongside its eastern european peers hungary and poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying eu concerns over the rule of law.

" russia is concerned that japan is allowing washington to use its territory as a base for a u.s. military build up in north asia under the pretext of countering north korea, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on friday. his remarks came at a joint press conference with his japanese counterpart, taro kono, after talks between the two men in moscow, and prompted kono to defend japan s stance toward north korea and its ties with the united states. japan had wanted to focus on resolving a seven decade old territorial dispute between the countries but lavrov s comments on north korea cast a shadow over the meeting.        we are expressing deep concern, with facts to back it up, that japan along with south korea is becoming a territory for the deployment of elements of the u.s. global missile defense system which is being rolled out in that region under the pretext of the north korea threat,  lavrov said.  we have no problems directly with japan, we do not see risks there. we see risks because of the proliferation of a global u.s. missile defense system on the territory of countries that neighbor russia, including japan.  he said that in the past few weeks the united states had conducted military exercises in the region and adopted additional sanctions despite the absence of provocation from pyongyang.  we are alarmed that in the last two months when north korea conducted no tests or rocket launches, it seemed that washington was not happy about that, and tried to do things that would irritate and provoke pyongyang,  lavrov said. referring to u.s. officials, he said:  it s as if they are hoping that they (the north koreans) will lash out again, and then it would be possible to engage in military options.   as you know, the u.s. leadership has said many times that all options are on the table, including military options, and we note that japanese prime minister shinzo abe, at a meeting with president trump in early november, said that he supports the american position 100 percent,  lavrov said. japanese foreign minister kono, after listening to lavrov s remarks, responded that japan and its allies were not seeking regime change in north korea. he said tokyo had to act to defend itself after pyongyang test fired missiles which flew over japan s territory.  this is unprecedented, the most important and most pressing threat not just to japan and russia but to the international community as a whole. it s absolutely unacceptable,  kono said, speaking through an interpreter.  we believe it s necessary to use all possible means and to increase the pressure on north korea as much as possible to stop its nuclear program and the rocket launches,  he said.  japan welcomes the position of the united states, which is that to protect japan and south korea, all means of deterrence will be used.  earlier this year, japan s abe expressed hope of a breakthrough in tokyo s dispute with moscow over a group of islands in the pacific, but that prospect has now dimmed. the islands are known in japan as the northern territories and in russia as the kurile islands. at the end of world war two, soviet forces took control over the islands from japan. the island dispute has meant that moscow and tokyo have still not signed a formal peace agreement to end war time hostilities. lavrov and kono said at their talks that they had made progress on measures to boost russian japanese economic cooperation on the islands, and to ease access for japanese people wanting to visit. they offered no details about any progress on resolving the core of the dispute, about who has sovereignty over the islands.

" republican candidates in tight races across the country have tied themselves in knots trying to decide whether to disavow or support their party’s presidential nominee, donald trump, especially since multiple sexual assault allegations against him have surfaced. but u.s. senator pat toomey of pennsylvania, who is in a virtual tie with his democratic challenger in a race that could tip control of the senate, has chosen a third option: say nothing. toomey appears to be the only vulnerable republican senator to have avoided answering the question of whether he will vote for trump, even as he has denounced the billionaire real estate developer’s lewd comments about women and allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. his democratic challenger, katie mcginty, has spent days hammering toomey for his reticence, coining the term “fraidy pat” and tying his candidacy to that of trump’s at every turn. but pennsylvania political analysts say toomey may have taken the safest path given his need to stitch together a coalition of working class, white voters who support trump and moderate, college educated suburbanites who find his rhetoric distasteful. polling averages show trump losing the state to hillary clinton by a margin of 6 to 7 percentage points, while mcginty held a lead of less than 1 point in the senate race, in polls before the senate candidates debated on monday. pennsylvania has not voted for a republican presidential candidate since george h.w. bush in 1988. toomey won his seat in 2010 by just 2 percentage points. “i think for him he’s making the right choice, because i think he has to have it both ways,” said g. terry madonna, the director of the franklin & marshall college poll in lancaster, pennsylvania. “he’s between a rock and a hard place, and he’s chosen to stay in the middle.” the question of whether to back their party’s presidential nominee   a non issue in virtually any other election year   has bedeviled republicans facing competitive races across the country, with control of the senate hanging in the balance. some, like senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire, have rescinded their support, angering trump’s core supporters. others, like senator richard burr of north carolina, have stuck with trump and risked losing moderate voters. a handful of republicans, including ayotte before she recently changed her mind, have tried to straddle the issue by withholding a formal endorsement while saying they still planned to vote for trump. the pennsylvania campaign, one of half a dozen close contests with the senate up for grabs, has been the most expensive senate race in the country, with more than $100 million from the parties and outside groups pouring into the state as of august. mcginty, who served as an environmental adviser in former president bill clinton’s administration, has spent months trying to link toomey to trump. she has redoubled her efforts over the last 10 days, as multiple women have come forward to accuse trump of sexually assaulting them following the release of a video recording from 2005 in which he bragged in lewd terms about such behavior.  on thursday, for the second time since the tape became public, mcginty held a conference call for reporters to assail toomey for what she described as his tacit support for trump. “senator pat toomey now has the distinction of being the only senate candidate in the entire united states of america to refuse to come clean about whether or not he supports donald trump,” she said. “so, there’s only one way to interpret that: pat toomey is still standing by donald trump.” toomey has criticized trump’s “outrageous comments” but has declined to say whether he will vote for him, a position he reiterated on monday at the first of two debates with mcginty. he did, however, say he “probably” will announce a decision before the nov. 8 elections, after previously suggesting he might not. in a statement, a toomey spokesman turned the criticism around, calling mcginty a “rubber stamp” for the democratic establishment in washington. “pat toomey has proven he will stand up to his own party for pennsylvania families, like on gun safety, fighting corporate welfare, or ending the wall street bailouts once and for all,” the spokesman, ted kwong, said in an email. “katie mcginty can’t name a single disagreement with her party, whether it’s the reckless iran deal or thousands in new middle class tax hikes.” charlie gerow, a veteran republican political consultant in pennsylvania who is not involved in the race, said toomey’s middle of the road strategy was necessary given the deficit trump is facing in the state. toomey, gerow said, cannot afford to alienate trump backers in places like southwestern pennsylvania, even as he tries to appeal to voters in the philadelphia and lehigh valley suburbs. “i think it is the best strategy among several unpalatable options,” gerow said. “i don’t think there was any better way to approach that dilemma.” ",0
"when obama had the opportunity to speak out against 49er s quarterback colin kaepernick s disrespect for our flag, he chose instead to defend his actions, explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem, as long as he was bringing attention to the cop-hating/killing, divisive black lives matter terror group president obama said san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem, but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept.at a news conference in china on monday, the president said he did not doubt kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of african americans by law enforcement in u.s. cities. obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues. there are a lot of ways you can do it,  obama said after the g-20 summit here.  as a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. but i don t doubt his sincerity. i think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. if nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. the president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between african americans and police officers over the past several years, including in baton rouge and dallas this year. you ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  obama said.  sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated. but i d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all. my suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it. maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality. that s how we move forward.    washington post",1
" chile s presidential hopefuls ended their campaigns in downtown santiago on thursday ahead of an uncertain runoff election whose outcome will determine whether the world s top copper producer turns to the right or maintains its center left track. voters on sunday will choose between billionaire conservative sebastian pinera and center left senator and journalist alejandro guillier. during the november first round election, a surprise surge by harder leftists confounded pollsters, sent markets plummeting and set the stage for a tighter than expected runoff.  everything points to a narrow margin of victory,  said guillermo holzmann, a professor at the university of valparaiso.  it s an unusual race in that it s been difficult to gauge the electorate.  both pinera and guillier would keep in place the longstanding free market economic model in latin america s most developed country. but candidates with more extreme views on both the right and left performed better than expected in november, leading both men to make concessions to try to win over voters whose first round choice dropped out. uruguay former president jose  pepe  mujica, a leftist icon in a latin america that has largely turned to the political right, turned out to support guillier.  the conservative right has no future in chile,  guillier told his fans.  pinera, 68, a former president and the market favorite, placed first with 36.6 percent of the vote in the first round. he has vowed to boost growth by cutting the corporate tax rate and scaling back outgoing president michelle bachelet s tax, labor and education reforms that guillier has vowed to deepen.  at santiago s caupolic n theater, he promised  a new and better treatment of the middle class, older adults and children.  the bearded guillier, 64, from northern chile, garnered 22.7 percent of the vote in november from backers hoping to preserve gains made in bachelet s government for students, women and workers, measures such as lower university fees and laws empowering unions. guillier has courted leftists by proposing to overhaul the country s privatized pension system and rewrite the constitution. pinera has sought to appeal to centrist voters by calling for free technical education for the poor and a public pension option. guillier narrowly edged out third place finisher beatriz sanchez of the leftist frente amplio. she received support from 20 percent of voters with promises to tax the  super rich  to boost social spending and fight inequality. sanchez s 1.3 million voters are seen as pivotal in the upcoming election. voting is voluntary in chile, and abstention has run high in recent years.  it comes down to how many people stay home, and particularly, how many people stay home on guillier s side,  said university of chile professor robert funk.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said he will decide on the timing of a snap general election after he returns on friday from a trip this week to address the united nations.  regarding the dissolution of the lower house, i would like to refrain from commenting on every question, but i would like to make a decision when i return home,  abe told reporters on monday as he left for new york, according to a foreign ministry transcript. abe is considering calling a general election, the third since he swept to power in december 2012, as early as oct. 22, to take advantage of a rebound in his approval ratings after a series of scandals for this coalition government, and disarray in the main opposition party, government and ruling party sources told reuters on sunday.     abe is scheduled to speak at the un general assembly and the new york stock exchange on wednesday, and is seeking to arrange meetings with u.s. president donald trump and south korean president moon jae in before returning to japan on friday. an early vote would take advantage of defections in opposition democratic party and could also dilute a potential challenge from an embryonic party that allies of popular tokyo governor yuriko koike, an ex ldp lawmaker, are trying to form.  abe s coalition would be likely to lose its two thirds  super majority  in the lower house but keep a simple majority, political sources say.

" early last year, leandro colmenares sold his car and his apartment and fled venezuela s profound economic crisis, joining a wave of emigration to other latin american countries. colmenares, a medical equipment repairman, first set up in panama with $7,000 in hand. when he could not get a visa and struggled to find work, he ended up with odd jobs like painting houses and doing electrical wiring for $25 a day.  in venezuela, i was rubbing shoulders with doctors. months later i was mopping the floor in a panama furniture shop,  said colmenares, who has two sons, including one who is disabled.  he then tried his luck in colombia, where he again took odd jobs, mostly cooking. he opened a small cafe with other venezuelans but it failed.   it was bad, i was going hungry. on weekends i ate once,  he said. and once again, he could not get a visa.  crushed and having run out of money, colmenares decided in february he had no choice but return to venezuela empty handed and by bus   one of an apparently growing number of venezuelan emigrants forced to go home after failing to start a new life elsewhere in latin america. these recent migrants are often poor, hopping on buses to latin american capitals with as little as a few hundred dollars and scant prospect of finding a decent job.  the country i left was bad. when i came back it was worse,  said colmenares, noting steep prices and ever less food on store shelves. he spends his days in his home in poor central caracas, scraping out a living making dough for corn patties. for decades after world war ii, venezuela s flourishing oil economy made it a destination for mass immigration from southern europe, with portuguese bakeries and spanish bars a common sight across caracas.   but during 18 years of socialist rule, an increase in crime, economic decay and political protests have prompted emigration to miami, madrid, and the rest of latin america.  sociologist tomas paez estimates over 2 million venezuelans have left the country of 30 million, accelerating in the last two years as the opec member s recession has worsened, leading to shortages of vital medicines and food, runaway inflation and lack of formal jobs. while the early diaspora was mostly a middle class phenomenon, recent migrants are more likely to be poor, heightening the chances that they will struggle.  there is no data on returnees but reuters interviewed 10 venezuelans who had emigrated after president nicolas maduro took office in 2013 only to return.  for miguel blanco, a caracas based sociologist, the degree of poverty among people now leaving the country has led to more of them returning.  when migration is triggered by push factors, it can lead the migrant to fail because of lack of money,  said blanco. pockets of venezuelan economic migrants, once a relatively rare sight in south america, have sprung up in cities from bogota to santiago de chile. they are often seen hawking traditional corn patties on the streets or offering door to door beauty treatments.      panama s head of migration said in august that some 2,000 venezuelans were setting up there every week, compared with  about 500 to 600 before august, when maduro s government created a legislative superbody that was widely condemned by the opposition and other countries as a power grab.  with about 60,000 venezuelans already in panama, the government has implemented visas as an entry requirement.  peru has estimated that in the first half of 2017 some 40,000 venezuelans entered the country.  venezuelan government supporters have said the extent of emigration has been exaggerated. maduro s administration scoffs at those who leave as selfish and unpatriotic. the information ministry did not respond to a request for data.  colombia, which shares a porous border of some 2,219 kilometers with venezuela, has estimated that about 36,000 venezuelans enter daily, and that some 2,000 do not immediately return to their country.   gerson lopez, a 30 year old graphic designer, said he was paid less by a colombian beauty product company because he did not have legal documents.   informal work there is very exploitative,  said lopez.  venezuelans are doing the work colombians don t want to do.   lopez was broke when he returned to venezuela in late january after being unable to find good work in bogota.   you have to think very hard if you re going to leave,  he said, adding bitterly,  (but) here you don t have any opportunities. all you do is survive.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on sunday it would be valuable for president elect donald trump’s transition team to seek state department recommendations before contacting foreign leaders but that it had yet to do so. “we have not been contacted before any of these conversations. we have not been requested to provide talking points,” kerry said during a question and answer session at a think tank conference. “i do think there’s a value, obviously on having at least the recommendations, whether you choose to follow them or not is a different issue, but i think it’s valuable to ask people who work the desk, and have worked it for a long period of time, their input on what’s the current state, is there some particular issue at the moment,” kerry added. “i think that’s valuable, and i would certainly recommend it, but, obviously, that hasn’t happened in a few cases.” trump’s call with taiwan president tsai ing wen on friday triggered a diplomatic protest from china and raised questions about whether the republican president elect might be signaling a change to u.s. policy. vice president elect mike pence denied that on sunday, describing it as a “courtesy call.” the telephone conversation was the first by a u.s. president elect or president with a taiwanese leader since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition to china from taiwan in 1979, acknowledging taiwan as part of “one china.” the diplomatic contretemps was one of several recently for trump, a real estate magnate who has never held public office and has no foreign affairs or military experience. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, is still considering his choice for secretary of state.

" the mastermind of the “bridgegate” lane closure scandal that helped torpedo new jersey governor chris christie’s presidential bid should not be sentenced to prison due to his cooperation, u.s. prosecutors said in a court document filed on tuesday. david wildstein, who helped the government convict two former christie associates after he pleaded guilty in 2015, is set to be sentenced in federal court in newark on wednesday. wildstein, 55, admitted overseeing a scheme to shut down access lanes at the busy george washington bridge in 2013 to create massive traffic gridlock as punishment for a local democratic mayor who refused to endorse christie’s reelection campaign. u.s. prosecutors charged wildstein, former christie deputy chief of staff bridget kelly and a former executive of the port authority of new york and new jersey, bill baroni, with concocting the plot. the port authority supervises operations for the george washington bridge, which connects manhattan and new jersey and is one of the world’s busiest crossings.     christie, who has denied any involvement, was not charged. but the fallout dogged his bid for the republican nomination for president in 2016 and has contributed to his current record low approval rating of 15 percent in new jersey. wildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities, eventually appearing as the star witness at kelly and baroni’s trial for eight days of testimony. “put simply, were it not for wildstein’s decision to cooperate and disclose the true nature of the lane reductions, there likely would have been no prosecutions related to the bridge scheme,” u.s. prosecutors wrote in arguing that wildstein should receive probation but no prison time. kelly and baroni were sentenced to 1 1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. wildstein testified at trial that he and baroni joked with christie about the traffic jams caused by the lane closures as they were occurring, an assertion that christie and baroni both denied. he also told jurors that he and baroni used the port authority as a “goody bag” to dole out favors to local officials in exchange for support for christie’s re election. in a court submission made public on tuesday, wildstein’s lawyer also requested probation, noting that wildstein voluntarily met with investigators at the start of their probe. “mr. wildstein remains alone in taking responsibility for his role in the george washington bridge lane realignment issue, even though others were clearly involved,” alan zegas wrote.

" goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) ceo lloyd blankfein said thursday on bloomberg tv that he would not be “one bit disappointed” if president donald trump nominated jerome powell as the new federal reserve chair. “his background is a terrific background   again a lot of government service, service in the fed, service in the private sector,” blankfein said. “i think he is a very great, credible candidate. there were other credible candidates as well but i am not one bit disappointed if it turns out to be j. powell.”  trump was expected on thursday afternoon to nominate powell for the post, putting his own stamp on the leadership of the u.s. central bank while signaling continuity on monetary policy. asked about powell’s lack of a phd, blankfein said, “i sometimes feel that people with phds   and believe me, i am not anti intellectual, i have a law degree, my kids went to graduate school, i’m not against people who have phds — but sometimes i wish people who only have phds had a little more life and professional and business experience.” blankfein also said a good u.s. tax plan will have “stimulative elements” and could get u.s. gdp growth to a higher level than 3 percent. “the free est kind of stimulus you could provide for the economy is confidence and peeling away redundant or bad regulation, to be frank,” blankfein said.  asked about bitcoin, which soared past $7,000 to a new record high on thursday, blankfein said: “i have a level of discomfort with it as i have a level of discomfort with anything that’s new. but i learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that i don’t love. “right now, i tell you, i don’t have an investment in it. but i’m not willing to pooh pooh it and that’s why, i say, i am open to it,” blankfein added.

" president elect donald trump on thursday picked former u.s. senator dan coats as his director of national intelligence, two senior transition officials said, as he puts his stamp on a u.s. intelligence community that he frequently criticizes. the official announcement was expected this week as trump makes decisions on some of the remaining major positions he must fill as he prepares to take over the white house on jan. 20. coats, 73, is a traditional conservative from indiana who just finished a six year term in the u.s. senate. he was also  u.s. ambassador to germany for republican president george w. bush.  coats “would be an excellent choice,” senate intelligence chairman richard burr, a north carolina republican, told reporters. “because dan’s got the experience, he’s got the leadership skills having been an ambassador and i think his time on the committee has served him to understand what that role entails.” one democratic official familiar with coats’ background and views described him as a “very reasonable guy.” another u.s. official familiar with intelligence matters said he was “very well respected on both sides of the aisle.” a source close to the transition said trump had also considered new jersey governor chris christie for the job but that christie had chosen not to take it. trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about the u.s. intelligence community’s assessment that russia had a hand in hacking during the presidential campaign. the democratic official said coats knew a lot about europe and russia and might “butt heads with trump over russia.” the president elect was to get a briefing about the intelligence community’s findings on the topic from senior u.s. officials on friday at trump tower in new york. some u.s. intelligence officials on thursday welcomed coats’ selection, saying they hoped his appointment was a sign that trump was seeking to mend fences with the intelligence community after months of enmity over its assessment that russia tried to influence the 2016 election through hacking. one official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue, said he hoped that if confirmed by the senate, coats could negotiate what he called “a truce” between the intelligence community and trump’s choice for national security adviser, retired army lieutenant general mike flynn, who was fired as defense intelligence agency director by the current director of national intelligence, james clapper. coats has been a vigorous defender of government surveillance programs, having voted against congressional reforms to the national security agency’s bulk collection of u.s. call records in 2015. while on the senate intelligence committee, coats also joined other republican members in 2014 in approving a minority report that defended the cia’s use of harsh interrogation methods against detainees in secret foreign prisons, saying the program “saved lives and played a vital role in weakening al qaida.” the conclusion contrasted with the majority report that found the program failed to produce significant intelligence and that the cia misled the bush administration, congress and the american public about the use of so called enhanced interrogation techniques. the techniques included waterboarding, which simulates drowning and was condemned as torture by president barack obama, other senior officials and lawmakers, and human rights experts    trump was also nearing decisions on two other cabinet positions, agriculture secretary and secretary of veterans affairs, with announcements expected soon, the source close to the transition said. the leading candidate to lead the u.s. department of agriculture was former georgia governor sonny perdue, although one source said idaho governor butch otter was also in the mix. for veterans affairs, trump met on tuesday with leo mackay jr., a former deputy secretary for veterans affairs and a senior vice president of lockheed martin corp (lmt.n), about the cabinet post.

" a british man detained in the united states for allegedly trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a donald trump rally is suffering from severe mental illness and risks dying in prison, his mother said on tuesday. michael sandford, 20, is due to face trial in nevada on aug. 22. he has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and one felony count of impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business. his mother, lynne sandford, told a news conference in london that her son, who has been diagnosed in the past with autism, depression and other mental health conditions, had been on suicide watch in a nevada prison for the past three weeks. she portrayed her son as a compassionate, child like man who enjoyed watching “peppa pig”, a british children’s television program, and who was bewildered and frightened by his incarceration. she said her son had attempted to take his own life when he was 14 years old and was suffering from anorexia. michael sandford was arrested after an incident at a trump rally at the treasure island hotel in las vegas on june 18, and later told an investigator he wanted to kill the republican presidential candidate, according to u.s. court papers. he has not been charged with attempted murder. “i accept that michael has tried to do a bad thing but he is mentally ill and is not a bad or dangerous person,” said his mother, adding that she had last spoken to him on the phone on sunday. “he kept breaking down and sobbing on the phone, saying ‘please, please, i just want to come home’. he’s very remorseful ... he’s just in a really bad way,” she said. sandford has launched a campaign to have her son repatriated to britain so he could be treated in a secure medical facility. she has raised $25,950 through the crowd funding website crowd justice to pay for legal and other expenses. she said a british consular official who had visited her son in prison had reported that he was shackled and handcuffed. “it’s not clear that michael actually understands what he has done,” said saimo chahal, the family’s british lawyer, speaking alongside lynne sandford. “because of his asperger’s, ocd (obsessive compulsive disorder) and other psychological conditions there is a question mark over whether he’s fit to plead and to undergo the trial process in the states,” she said. chahal said she was working to provide the public defenders’ office in nevada with independent evidence of michael sandford’s mental illness. she expected the trial to be postponed by at least 56 days initially to allow time for that. she hoped a trial would not happen and that sandford would be repatriated to britain as part of a plea bargain agreement.

" u.s. republican senator marco rubio reluctantly backed president donald trump’s nominee for secretary of state, rex tillerson, in a move that all but secures senate confirmation of the former exxon mobil corp chief executive as the nation’s top diplomat later on monday.  rubio said he was troubled by tillerson’s recent responses before lawmakers regarding russia as well as other countries, but that he ultimately decided he would vote to approve the nominee in deference to trump, as well as to fill a critical top job. “despite my reservations, i will support mr. tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full senate,” rubio said in a statement ahead of the senate foreign relations committee’s vote on tillerson.  a vote in the republican controlled senate was expected shortly after the committee vote. tillerson was expected to win confirmation, despite opposition from democrats.  rubio, a onetime rival to trump for the republican presidential nomination, said he would not be so deferential regarding trump’s other nominees for top state department posts.   at a confirmation hearing earlier this month, tillerson’s views appeared to be at odds with trump’s on key foreign policy issues such as nuclear proliferation, trade deals, climate change and relations with mexico. the nominee also had a tense exchange with rubio on whether he believed russian president vladimir putin was a war criminal, in reference to russia’s military actions in support of syria’s government. tillerson said he would not use that term.  tillerson, 64, also sidestepped questions on human rights, declining to condemn countries like saudi arabia and the philippines for rights abuses.    over the weekend, fellow republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham said they would back tillerson despite their concerns over his relationship with putin as ceo of one of the world’s largest corporations.     republican senator rob portman on monday also voiced his support and said he was reassured by tillerson’s commitment at the jan. 11 hearing to support nato, an organization that trump has voiced differing opinions about. earlier on monday, the most senior democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, ben cardin, said he would not support tillerson. “the power of the secretary of state to call out wrong, to name and shame, and to fight each day on behalf of the american people and freedom seeking people the world over is an enduring symbol,” cardin said in a prepared statement.

" top u.s. intelligence officials will testify before a senate panel next week on the law governing the collection of foreign intelligence, parts of which are due to expire at the end of the year, the senate intelligence committee said on friday.  director of national intelligence dan coats, acting fbi director andrew mccabe, national security agency director mike rogers and deputy u.s. attorney general rod rosenstein will appear before the committee in both open public and closed door hearings on wednesday to discuss the foreign intelligence surveillance act, or fisa, the committee said in a statement.  the next day, former fbi director james comey, who was fired by president donald trump last month, is scheduled to testify before the same committee.  comey had been overseeing an fbi investigation into russian interference during the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between moscow and trump associates, and the senate panel is conducting a parallel probe. a part of fisa known as section 702 will expire on dec. 31 unless congress votes to reauthorize it. the statute allows the nsa to collect digital communications of foreigners believed to be living overseas whose communications pass through american phone or internet providers. for technical reasons, it also incidentally collects data on americans, a practice that privacy advocates have said evades constitutional protections against warrantless searches. fisa and u.s. surveillance practices have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid unsubstantiated assertions by president donald trump and other republicans that the white house under former president barack obama improperly spied on trump or his associates.  a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the house of representatives is working on legislation that would renew section 702 but with additional transparency and oversight, among other changes, though it remains unclear if it would have enough support to pass congress and be signed by trump. a white house official told reuters in march the administration supported the law’s renewal and did not want to alter it.

" the united states plans to renew the bulk of its sanctions against myanmar when they expire next week, but will make some  changes aimed at boosting investment and trade, according to several senior u.s. officials and congressional aides. an announcement on extending much of the international emergency economic powers act, or ieepa, could come as soon as tuesday ahead of a visit to the southeast asian nation by secretary of state john kerry on may 22, officials said. the u.s. treasury department has significantly eased sanctions against myanmar by issuing general licenses that give companies and investors exemptions to sanctions targeting more than 100 individuals and businesses, including some of myanmar’s biggest business players. u.s. officials began lifting trade and financial sanctions against the country after military leaders launched reforms that led to a civilian government being formed in 2011, beginning its transformation from a half century as an international pariah. in december, treasury temporarily relaxed trade restrictions on the country also known as burma by allowing all shipments to go through its ports and airports for six months. this time, washington will likely offer more general licenses to specific companies, and take some people off treasury’s list of “specially designated individuals” targeted for sanctions, congressional aides and u.s. officials said. kerry’s visit to myanmar is his first since the party of aung san suu kyi, the country’s nobel laureate, swept to power following a landslide election win in november. a constitution drafted by the country’s former military rulers bars her from becoming president. president barack obama’s opening to myanmar followed by its peaceful transition to an elected government is seen as one of his foreign policy achievements. he has visited there twice. but the administration also wants to maintain leverage on the country to guard against backsliding on reforms and to press for improvement on human rights. by renewing the legal framework for sanctions even as it eases some measures, obama will offer the private sector more breathing room while maintaining pressure on its military, which still holds significant political power. the sanctions had been due to expire on may 20. washington has deep concerns about human rights conditions in predominantly buddhist myanmar, especially violence against ethnic and religious minorities including rohingya muslims. members of the u.s. congress, from both parties, are watching closely and could move to clamp down on myanmar themselves if they think obama is moving too quickly. last month, senators cory gardner and ben cardin, the republican and democratic leaders of the foreign relations asia subcommittee, wrote to kerry and treasury secretary jack lew expressing concern about rights, and asking the administration to work with congress to ensure those concerns were addressed.  “like you, we want to ensure that the u.s. is burma’s strongest supporter on its road to democracy,” the senators said in the letter, seen by reuters. u.s. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said aung san suu kyi supported the extension of u.s. sanctions with some changes. discussions with her have focused on how to properly target trade restrictions so they do not hurt myanmar’s overall economy, but keep pressure on military owned institutions, they said. “we are looking to take steps to demonstrate our support for the new democratically elected government of burma ...and that we’re taking the necessary steps to ensure that they succeed, that they can carry on economic developments and reforms,” a senior administration official told reuters. “at the same time we want to do that in a smart, measured way that gives us a range of options and flexibility to respond appropriately going forward,” the official added. the united states is eager to expand relations with myanmar to help counteract china’s rise in asia and take advantage of the opening of one of the world’s last “frontier markets,” growing but less developed emerging economies. peter kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the u.s. treasury, said despite an easing of some banking sanctions by the united states since 2012, transactions with myanmar were still difficult. “i suspect the changes that get announced all drive at the same end goal: which is to promote and make easier the trade and business relationships between the two countries and encourage continued reform while minding concerns,” said kucik. “the details will really indicate where the principal areas of remaining concern are but broadly speaking they are going to be aligned with what we’ve seen so far,” he said.

" comprehensive reform of the u.s. tax code is still likely to pass by the end of 2017 despite the government spending deal president donald trump struck with democrats, u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday.  in an interview with fox business network, mnuchin said he was not worried about the plan going off track because of either  democrats, who won the surprise deal on wednesday with the republican president, or more conservative republicans making their own demands.  “it’s still very viable to get it done this year,” mnuchin said. “we have a path to get this done this year, and we’re still very hopeful that we can get it done,” he added, saying it was his and trump’s top priority.  asked whether he was concerned, however, that democrats could use the funding deal struck wednesday to make demands such as rejecting any tax cut for the wealthy or pushing for a cut for middle income earners, mnuchin said no.  instead, he said wednesday’s deal “cleared the decks 90 days to have more room to focus on taxes. i think that was a big win,” adding that he expected some democrats to back the final plan. separately, axios reported that the freedom caucus, a more conservative faction of house republicans, is planning to unveil their own tax plan that would cut the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent to 16 percent.  it would also double the standard, abandon the idea of revenue neutrality and push some kind of welfare reform, axios said, citing people familiar with the matter. asked about the report, mnuchin told fox business network: “i’m not worried about any gop revolt at all,” adding that lawmakers could push their ideas with leadership as part of a regular legislative process. mnuchin did not give any more details about the administration’s tax proposal. on wednesday, trump said he would offer more details about his tax reform plan in about two weeks.

" kentucky’s republican governor on tuesday called for an investigation into how his democratic predecessor awarded state contracts and solicited campaign contributions, opening a new round in the feud between the two political families. governor matt bevin said he has asked for the hiring of a law firm to determine whether steve beshear’s administration coerced state employees into donating to political campaigns.  the call by bevin comes just over a week after beshear’s son andy, kentucky’s attorney general, sued bevin in an effort to block funding cuts to public universities that he said are illegal.  bevin on tuesday said his administration also has concerns about contracts, some issued through a no bid process, that may have rewarded family members of beshear’s staff. the law firm would have the ability to subpoena witnesses and records, and work closely with the state inspector general, he said. “these discoveries ... raise questions that must be answered in an open and transparent way,” bevin, who is the just second republican elected to the state’s highest office since 1971, said at a press conference. “only then will the citizens of the commonwealth begin to have confidence in their government.” beshear, who was barred from seeking reelection due to term limits, strongly denied the charges in a facebook post. “there was never any attempt to pressure employees to make political contributions, and we followed both the spirit and the letter of procurement laws,” he said, adding bevin’s move was a “pathetic spectacle.” andy beshear said bevin was not properly pursuing the issue. the attorney general said in a statement tuesday that he agreed issues such as no bid contracts should be scrutinized, including a pair awarded by bevin’s administration.       “the governor is once again overstating his authority,” beshear said, adding that the kentucky executive branch ethics commission and not the cabinet was the appropriate agency for any such probe. before taking office in december, bevin called steve beshear’s appointment of his wife to an unpaid seat on the state horse park commission an “embarrassment.” meanwhile, the former governor has launched a campaign against bevin’s healthcare initiatives.

" a new u.s. rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit hungry brokers turned out to be much weaker than an initial proposal after the obama administration bowed to pressure from the financial services industry. the rule, announced by the department of labor on wednesday, sets a so called fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients’ best interests ahead of their bottom line. the language is tougher than an existing rule that only requires brokers to ensure products are “suitable.” however, the labor department did compromise with the industry on a range of provisions. unlike the draft proposal, the final rule does not restrict brokers from pushing proprietary products, splitting revenue with creators of funds they promote, or recommending risky, high fee investments in alternative assets and certain annuities. brokers also got more time to implement the changes, which they said were costly and difficult. the rule will now take full effect on jan. 1, 2018, compared with an eight month compliance deadline in the labor department’s initial proposal. nonetheless, brokers will now be covered by a fiduciary standard, said massachusetts senator elizabeth warren, a consumer advocate who helped shine a national spotlight on the proposal last year. “there’s no doubt there is some risk,” warren, a democrat, said in an interview. “on the other hand, the department of labor was not looking to put all proprietary products out of business,” warren said. the goal is to make sure there is “adequate regulation,” said warren, adding that she now believes there will be. democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton issued a statement in support of the new rule, saying it will “stop wall street from ripping off families” and “save seniors billions.” however, knut rostad, an investor advocate who chairs the institute for the fiduciary standard, said he was disappointed that the final rule was not tougher, calling it “a major defeat for investors, period.” some leading republican lawmakers also expressed continued opposition to the rule, saying it would prevent low  and middle income americans from saving for retirement or getting access to advice. several major brokerage firms said they needed time to review the implications, but that they generally supported the idea of a “best interest” rule. industry trade groups reiterated concerns that the rule could have negative effects. but several wall street analysts who cover brokerages, insurers and mutual fund companies affected by the rule said it turned out to be much less onerous than initially feared. shares of brokerage, mutual fund and life insurance companies showed little reaction to the news. the labor department “meaningfully softened” the rule, morgan stanley insurance analysts said, characterizing it as “good news for those companies impacted.” wednesday’s announcement caps a fierce, six year battle involving the labor department, wall street and many u.s. lawmakers. the department received more than 3,000 letters about the rule and took part in more than 100 meetings. it first issued a proposal in 2010 but rescinded it the following year in response to an enormous industry backlash. a second proposal issued last year also faced criticism. firms have said the rule would raise compliance costs, and therefore fees, and force them to get rid of main street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans.  the labor department said complying with the rule would cost the brokerage industry up to $31.5 billion over the next decade but produce even bigger gains for investors. some lawmakers said the labor department should hold off until the u.s. securities and exchange commission finalizes its own fiduciary rule, which it has been crafting for years. sec commissioner michael piwowar expressed opposition to the final rule on wednesday. president barack obama had made a new fiduciary rule a priority for his administration. in a speech at aarp headquarters last year, he said wall street brokers were bilking retirees out of billions of dollars in savings through hidden fees and that he intended to ensure the industry put clients’ interests first. “if expecting retirement advisers to act in their clients’ best interest sounds like it’s pretty obvious – and it’s pretty obviously the right thing to do – it’s because it is,” jeff zients, director of the white house’s national economic council, said in a call with reporters. although the final rule did include the best interest provision, it made plenty of concessions. for example, the draft listed types of assets that advisers could recommend to steer retail investors away from certain high risk products. the final version eliminates that list, mostly in response to the financial industry’s concerns, the labor department said. brokerages and lawmakers were also concerned about an earlier requirement that brokers sign contracts with clients at initial meetings. the document was to include investment projections, fee disclosures and other detailed information.  the contracts are required in the final rule, but can be as short as a paragraph, signed later and tucked into paperwork that customers sign when opening new accounts, labor secretary thomas perez said. the final version also loosened guidelines on pay, allowing advisers to collect “common types of compensation,” such as commissions and revenue sharing, where brokerages receive payments from mutual fund companies to help promote products.

" the company owned by the family of senior white house aide jared kushner will skip roadshow events in china this weekend seeking money from local investors for a real estate project in exchange for a shot at u.s. immigrant visas, a company spokesman said. nicole kushner meyer, jared’s sister, appeared at marketing events last weekend in beijing and shanghai in an effort to raise $150 million from chinese investors through the controversial eb 5 visa for investment program. according to marketing materials from one of the organizers of the roadshow, sales events for the project are scheduled in the southern cities of shenzhen on saturday and guangzhou on sunday. “no one from kushner companies will be in china this weekend,” james yolles, spokesman for the firm, said. the company and kabr group are raising money for a two tower apartment complex in new jersey called one journal square, marketing materials showed. kushner companies earlier this week apologized for meyer having mentioned jared kushner, u.s. president donald trump’s son in law, in discussing the project. the company said meyer had done so only in an attempt to make clear that her brother was not involved. “kushner companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. that was not ms. meyer’s intention,” it said. in addition to meyer, laurent morali, president of kushner companies, was included in marketing materials online for the china road show. jared kushner, whose white house portfolio includes relations with china, sold his stake in kushner companies to a family trust early this year. the eb 5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy u.s. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. a member of the audience at the marketing event in shanghai said meyer spoke for about 10 minutes during last sunday’s event and described her family’s humble roots. according to the new york times, in beijing on saturday she told the audience of about 100 people the project “means a lot to me and my entire family”.

" iran has dismissed a u.s. demand for united nations nuclear inspectors to visit its military bases as  merely a dream . it also said the international atomic energy agency (iaea) was unlikely to agree anyway. the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, nikki haley, last week pressed the iaea to seek access to iranian military bases to ensure that they were not concealing activities banned by the 2015 nuclear deal reached between iran and six major powers. u.s. president donald trump has called the nuclear pact   negotiated under his predecessor barack obama    the worst deal ever . in april, he ordered a review of whether a suspension of nuclear sanctions on iran was in the u.s. interest. iranian government spokesman mohammad baqer nobakht responded at a weekly news conference broadcast on state television on tuesday.  iran s military sites are off limits,  he said.  all information about these sites are classified. iran will never allow such visits. don t pay attention to such remarks that are only a dream.  iranian president hassan rouhani followed up later by saying the u.s. call was unlikely to be accepted by the u.n. nuclear watchdog.  the international atomic energy agency is very unlikely to accept america s demand to inspect our military sites,  rouhani said in a televised interview. rouhani gave no indication why he believed the iaea would decline the request. under the deal, the iaea can request access to iranian sites including military ones if it has concerns about activities there that violate the agreement, but it must show iran the basis for those concerns. that means new and credible information pointing to such a violation is required first, officials from the agency and major powers say. there is no indication that washington has presented such information to back up its call for inspections of iranian military sites. under u.s. law, the state department must notify congress every 90 days of iran s compliance with the nuclear deal. the next deadline is october, and trump has said he thinks by then the united states will declare iran to be non compliant. so far, iaea inspectors have certified that iran is fully complying with the deal, under which it significantly reduced its enriched uranium stockpile and took steps to ensure no possible use of it for a nuclear weapon. this was in return for an end to international sanctions that had helped cripple its oil based economy. during its decade long stand off with world powers over its nuclear program, iran repeatedly rejected visits by u.n. inspectors to its military sites, saying they had nothing to do with nuclear activity and so were beyond the iaea s purview. shortly after the deal was reached, iran allowed inspectors to check its parchin military complex, where western security services believe tehran carried out tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations more than a decade ago. iran has denied this.  under the 2015 accord, iran could not get sanctions relief until the iaea was satisfied tehran had answered outstanding questions about the so called  possible military dimensions  of its past nuclear research.  iran has placed its military bases off limits also because of what it calls the risk that iaea findings could find their way to the intelligence services of its u.s. or israeli foes.  the americans will take their dream of visiting our military and sensitive sites to their graves ... it will never happen,  ali akbar velayati, a top adviser to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, iran s highest authority, told reporters.

" u.s. republican senator john mccain said on sunday he would subpoena 10 u.s. sailors to testify about their brief detention by iran if the obama administration does not provide the findings of an investigation into the incident by march 1. “it’s an option that i do not want to exercise,” mccain, who chairs the senate armed services committee, told reporters as he was returning to the united states from an international security conference in germany.     the sailors were detained by the islamic revolutionary guard corps after their two patrol boats strayed into iranian waters on jan. 12. u.s. officials later blamed a navigational problem.  the americans were freed the next day after u.s. secretary of state john kerry intervened with iranian foreign minister javad zarif, averting a diplomatic crisis just days before implementation of the iran nuclear deal and the lifting of international sanctions on tehran. iranian media broadcast videos of the detainees, including scenes in which revolutionary guards personnel trained weapons on the sailors as they kneeled. the obama administration has said the sailors’ speedy release showed the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with iran. the u.s. navy had briefed mccain several times about the incident, and would continue to do so as the investigation proceeded, said one u.s. official. republicans have been critical of the deal with iran, and some say the detainment of the sailors showed how little regard iran had for the united states.     mccain said he had been told the sailors were still being debriefed, but added that he assumed that administration members were “dragging their feet” in completing an investigation into the incident, which he accused iran of exploiting for propaganda purposes.     “i guarantee you, if they don’t have a debrief by the first of march like they said, we’ll have a hearing and we’ll subpoena. we’re not going to wait any longer,” mccain said. “we will subpoena the individuals if we have to.” mccain said he raised the case in a meeting on saturday with kerry on the sidelines of the security conference in munich.

" late birdies from thomas pieters and zach johnson gave the duo a share of the lead after the third round of the world golf championship bridgestone invitational on saturday. pieters, looking to become the first belgian winner on the pga tour, birdied the 18th hole for a four under par 66 that moved him to nine under par 201 at firestone country club in akron, ohio. his late birdie moved him level with twice major winner johnson, who moments earlier had also birdied the last for a five under par 65 that briefly gave him the outright lead. the pair are one shot clear of australian scott hend (63), with japan’s hideki matsuyama (67) two shots back, and rory mcilroy (68) tied with two others another shot further adrift. “if i would have walked off today with a 65 or a 66, i would have felt that was a fair reflection of how i played,” said mcilroy.  “but only three behind going into tomorrow, i can get off to a fast start and try and put a bit of pressure on the guys up ahead of me.” overnight leader jimmy walker fell back after mixing two double bogeys with two bogeys and two birdies for a four over 74 that left him six back in a share of 10th with bubba watson (66), jason day (70) and u.s. open champion brooks koepka (67). day was frustrated after following a birdie at the par five 16th with two bogeys that left him with much more work to do in the final round. “i’m pretty angry right now, to be honest,” said day. “going bogey bogey is pretty poor coming down the stretch. i’ve got to do something special tomorrow so i get my chances back to try and win this thing.” british open champion jordan spieth (71) saw his hopes fade after two bogeys over his final three holes left him seven shots back in a share of 16th. pieters started the round two shots back of walker and got off to a sizzling start with four birdies in his first five holes but started to unravel down the stretch. the long hitting belgian made a pair of bogeys starting at the 13th that dropped him back into a share of the lead. he did well to make birdie two holes later but then fell back into a share of the lead again after a bogey at the 17th. hend’s 63, the lowest round of the day by two shots, was built on four birdies on each nine with his only blemish coming in the form of a three putt bogey at the par three seventh.

" a u.s. appeals court on tuesday threw out the conviction of former new york state senate majority leader dean skelos, citing a recent u.s. supreme court decision that narrowed the conduct that can sustain federal corruption charges. but the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals said federal prosecutors can retry skelos and his son, adam skelos, for bribery and fraud because the evidence presented at trial was “sufficient” to prove their case. the ruling came two months after the court also vacated the bribery conviction of former new york state assembly speaker sheldon silver, employing similar reasoning. acting u.s. attorney in manhattan joon kim said in a statement that his office would pursue a “prompt retrial where we will have another opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence of dean skelos and adam skelos’ guilt.” prosecutors previously said they would also retry silver. alexandra shapiro, a lawyer for skelos, said in an email: “we believe that as events unfold it is going to become clear that this is a case that never should have been brought.” the back to back convictions of silver and skelos, the state’s most powerful legislators, in november and december 2015 represented two of the most high profile victories for former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara, who made public corruption a major focus during his tenure before he was fired by u.s. president trump in march. skelos, 69, a republican, was sentenced to five years in prison in may 2016, while his son adam was sentenced to 6 1/2 years. both were free on bail at the time of tuesday’s decision. together with governor andrew cuomo, skelos and silver were members of the “three men in a room” in the state capital of albany that hold enormous sway over major legislation. the u.s. supreme court last year overturned the corruption conviction of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell, finding that routine acts such as setting up meetings or contacting other politicians did not qualify as “official acts” under federal bribery statutes. the 2nd circuit said on tuesday that the jury instructions at skelos’ trial, which occurred before the mcdonnell decision, were therefore improper, through no fault of the judge or the prosecutors. the elder skelos was found guilty of using his position as senate majority leader to pressure three companies seeking his political support into paying his son, including for a lucrative “no show” job. in exchange, skelos pushed through bills to benefit the companies, according to prosecutors. the case is u.s. v. skelos et al, 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals, nos. 16 1618 and 16 1697.

" danish inventor peter madsen has admitted to dismembering swedish journalist kim wall on board his submarine in august and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he still denies killing her, police said on monday. the police said in a statement madsen had told them in an oct. 14 interrogation that wall, 30, had died from carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine, while he was on the deck of the vessel. the police would now gather additional information from coroners and submarine experts from the danish defense command. in past court hearings, madsen said that wall had died accidentally after being hit by a heavy hatch cover on his uc3 nautilus submarine.   the police said they would now extend the charges against madsen   which already include murder and mutilating wall s body   to include sexual assault without intercourse, based on 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist s genitals.  kim wall had suffered 14 stabs in and around the genitals and it is due to these stabs that we have said that there must have been a sexual motive,  police spokesman jens moller jensen told journalists in copenhagen.  madsen denies the murder and sexual assault charges. the cause of death was still unknown, said jensen.  wall, a freelance journalist who was researching a story on madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17 metre (56 foot) submarine in august. on aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in copenhagen as wall s. wall s arms as well as her and madsen s mobile phones are still missing and the police are currently assessing if divers should continue the search for them.  earlier this month, police said they had also recovered wall s head and legs. they said they found no skull fracture, despite madsen s earlier account that she had been hit on the head by the hatch cover.  the submarine is one of three that madsen built, and one of the largest of its kind privately produced in the world. it could carry eight people and weighed 40 tonnes fully equipped.  the case has been scheduled to run for eight days at copenhagen s district court from march 8 2018.

" illinois took another step on wednesday that is bound to lead nowhere in solving its strangled finances, with the democratic led house approving a new spending plan and republican governor bruce rauner immediately vowing to veto it, saying it was $7 billion out of balance. the fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63 53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue.  however, the democrats’ plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue. the spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the democrats’ fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by rauner, with the exception of k 12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. that has left illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began july 1, 2015. the state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year. “this is a repeat of last year on steroids,” said house republican leader jim durkin during the budget debate. but house majority leader barbara flynn currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.    “it is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come,” she said. the house passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among k 12 school districts, most notably the cash strapped chicago public schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. the budget now moves to the democrat controlled senate, where its fate was unclear. comptroller leslie munger, a republican, warned of “catastrophic” results if the house budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process.  a coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on wednesday asking the cook county court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson delivered a message of support to european allies in brussels on tuesday but their concerns about president donald trump’s foreign policy have created a rift on a host of issues. european allies are troubled by trump’s “america first” rhetoric, his decision not to certify iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, his withdrawal from the paris climate accord and now plans to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem.  tillerson told europe’s foreign ministers at the european union and nato that the u.s. government remains committed to transatlantic ties that trump has previously questioned.  tillerson also sought to reassure u.s. diplomats posted abroad that his ideas to revamp the country’s foreign service were bearing fruit, saying he would reveal a modernization plan for the u.s. state department soon. tillerson, the former chief executive of exxon mobil, said his visit showed “the strong commitment the u.s. has to the european alliance, the important role that the european alliance plays in our shared security objectives.” before a lunch with eu foreign ministers, tillerson stressed “shared values, shared objectives for security and prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.” trump visited the u.s. led nato alliance in may to admonish european leaders on their low defense spending. during his visit on tuesday, tillerson offered a more generous appraisal and gave an “unwavering” u.s. commitment to nato’s mutual defense clause, which considers an attack on one ally as an attack on all. tillerson ignored questions from reporters about whether he would be ousted from the white house, while his senior adviser r.c. hammond said no eu or nato foreign ministers raised the issue of whether tillerson’s job was secure. in his first substantive public comments since reports last week of a white house plan for cia director mike pompeo to replace him, tillerson said despite “a little criticism”, he was on top of his job. “while we don’t have any wins on the board yet, i can tell you we’re in a much better position to advance america’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” he told senior u.s. diplomats and u.s. embassy staff at the u.s. mission to belgium in brussels.  tillerson’s trip will also take him to vienna and paris. while trump said last week he was not leaving and tillerson said the reports were untrue,, trump has also said he alone determines u.s. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on friday: “i call the final shots.”  tillerson told u.s. diplomats gathered at the embassy in belgium that it had been “a bit of a shock” to meet trump for the first time when he was approached as a possible secretary of state late last year.   diplomats said eu governments face a dilemma because tillerson’s views are more closely aligned with theirs but may not reflect those of trump. foreign ministers had been open about sharing disagreements with the united states on various issues, hammond said. one eu diplomat said it was “fairly predictable” given tensions on issues, including trump’s handling of the north korea nuclear crisis and his threat to “totally destroy” the secretive country. “allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” hammond said, although he said it was important to be honest, adding that: “dialogues only work if they go two ways.” in a speech in berlin before flying to brussels, german foreign minister sigmar gabriel warned that the european union could no longer rely on the united states as its closest ally. “the withdrawal of the united states under donald trump from its reliable role as a guarantor of western led multilateralism accelerates a change of the world order with immediate consequences for german and european interests,” gabriel said. standing next to tillerson on the podium at the eu headquarters in brussels, eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini also warned the trump administration about a possible plan to the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem. trump is considering recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, which gabriel also said could unleash turmoil. “a lot of member states, including us, are concerned that the recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel will not calm the conflict but rather inflame it,” gabriel said at nato after the eu ministers’ lunch with tillerson. the european union, as the palestinians’ biggest aid donor and israel’s top trade partner, says it has a right to make its voice heard in any u.s. initiatives in the middle east.

" an indian court on thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence, their lawyer said. aarushi talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the delhi suburb of noida in 2008. a day later, the body of the servant, hemraj, was found on the roof of the house. a trial court convicted the girl s parents, rajesh and nupur talwar, after police alleged rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation. the couple, both dentists, were jailed for life. but a high court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed, their lawyer tanveer ahmed mir said.  the court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the talwars had killed their daughter,  mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in the northern city of allahabad. both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage, damaging their defense. aarushi s case was labeled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural, conservative parts of india where  honor killings  are not uncommon. every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the indian press, turning the talwars into household names.  finally my family can lead a dignified life. the court has upheld the facts and truth,  said rajesh talwar s sister, vandana, after the decision. in 2015, a journalist who covered the murder wrote a book arguing that the couple were innocent. the double murder case and faulty probe were used as a theme for a bollywood movie the same year.

" u.s. president donald trump said on friday that he backs the nato charter’s demand that all members be prepared to defend each other, weeks after jarring allies by not restating u.s. support for the agreement. at a joint news conference with romanian president klaus iohannis, trump said he supports the nato charter’s article 5, the requirement that each member of the alliance defend each other if they come under attack. during a visit to nato headquarters last month in brussels, trump had pointedly not mentioned u.s. support for the critical portion of the nato charter. he used his speech there to demand that members pay more for the alliance’s defense. a senior white house official later had said the united states does in fact support article 5 simply by agreeing to the terms of the charter. but having not mentioned it himself, trump sowed some doubts among allies and the ensuing controversy prompted vice president mike pence to later express explicit u.s. support for the charter. senior aides to trump had tried to get a statement of explicit support for article 5 in the president’s nato speech but it was not included, a senior administration official said. “i’m committing the united states to article 5 and certainly we are there to protect and that’s one of the reasons that i want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force,” trump said. “but yes, absolutely i’d be committed to article 5,” he said.

" when u.s. president donald trump boasted early last week that he had sent an “armada” as a warning to north korea, the aircraft carrier strike group he spoke of was still far from the korean peninsula, and headed in the opposite direction.  it was even farther away over the weekend, moving through the sunda strait and then into the indian ocean, as north korea displayed what appeared to be new missiles at a parade and staged a failed missile test.  the u.s. military’s pacific command explained on tuesday that the strike group first had to complete a shorter than initially planned period of training with australia. but it was now “proceeding to the western pacific as ordered,” it said.  the perceived communications mix up has raised eyebrows among korea experts, who wonder whether it erodes the trump administration’s credibility at a time when u.s. rhetoric about the north’s advancing nuclear and missile capabilities are raising concerns about a potential conflict.  “if you threaten them and your threat is not credible, it’s only going to undermine whatever your policy toward them is. and that could be a logical conclusion from what’s just happened,” said north korea expert joel wit at the 38 north monitoring group, run by johns hopkins university’s school of advanced international studies.  the u.s. military initially said in a statement dated april 10 that admiral harry harris, the commander of pacific command, directed the carl vinson strike group “to sail north and report on station in the western pacific.”  reuters and other news outlets reported on april 11 that the movement would take more than a week. the navy, for security reasons, says it does not report future operational locations of its ships.  defense secretary jim mattis initially appeared to play down the deployment on april 11, saying the vinson was “just on her way up there because that’s where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time.”  “there’s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we’re sending her up there,” he said.  but even mattis initially misspoke about the strike group’s itinerary, telling a news conference that the vinson had pulled out of an exercise with australia.  the pentagon has since corrected the record, saying the ship’s planned port visit to fremantle, australia, was canceled   not the exercise with australia’s navy.  on april 15, the u.s. navy even published a photo showing the vinson transiting the sunda strait. here from april 16 18, the website www.gonavy.jp/cvlocation.html reported that the vinson was in the indian ocean.  a u.s. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the vinson carried out the exercises after passing through the sunda strait and wrapped them up this week.

" papua new guinean police cleared the remaining asylum seekers from a shuttered australian run detention complex on friday, ending a three week protest which started with some 600 people surviving on rain water and smuggled food and supplies. australia closed the manus island detention centre on oct. 31, after it was declared illegal by a papua new guinea court, but the asylum seekers refused to leave to transit centres saying they feared for their safety. despite the unsanitary conditions and lack of adequate food and fresh water, about 300 remained when papua new guinea police started removing people on thursday and friday.  the refugees are leaving the prison camp,  kurdish journalist behrouz boochani told reuters in a text message on friday.  we did our best to send out our voice but the government does not care.  australia s immigration minister peter dutton said in a statement on friday that all of the asylum seekers had now departed for alternative accommodation.  advocates should now desist from holding out false hope to these men that they will ever be brought to australia,  dutton said. in geneva, the u.n. refugee agency unhcr denounced the use of force by papua new guinean police to remove the refugees and asylum seekers and called for australia to ensure their protection.  the beating of refugees and asylum seekers by uniformed officers with metal poles, shown by footage released today, is both shocking and inexcusable,  unhcr said in a statement. several refugees were  severely injured  in the raid and needed medical treatment, it added, warning of a  grave risk  of further deterioration of the situation on the island. the fate of the asylum seekers, some of whom have been detained for years and come mostly from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka and syria, remains unclear. australia steadfastly refuses to allow them entry under its strict  sovereign borders  policy and the asylum seekers have refused to resettle in papua new guinea.  australia and papua new guinea both say the asylum seekers are now the other s responsibility, although the australian government said it had spent a$10 million ($7.6 million) on the transit facility and it wanted the men to move there. under australia s  sovereign borders  policy asylum seekers trying to reach its shores by boat are intercepted and detained in either papua new guinea or nauru in the south pacific. the united nations and human rights groups have for years criticised australia s policy, citing human rights abuses in the offshore detention centres and called for their closure.  papua new guinea intensified efforts to clear the manus facility on thursday by bringing in buses to start moving the men and cutting off routes previously used to deliver smuggled supplies, said christian pastor jarrod mckenna, who was at the shuttered centre earlier this week helping the refugees.  pictures sent to reuters by an asylum seeker showed papua new guinean officials wearing army fatigues inside the camp on friday, and a video distributed by advocacy group getup showed police armed with sticks pulling an asylum seeker to his feet.       buses are waiting for you, trucks are waiting for you...you will get on to them and you will move to your new location, you will not stay here,  a man who identified himself as a police commander told the asylum seekers in a video posted to facebook by sudanese refugee abdul aziz. papua new guinea immigration and police officials did not return telephone calls from reuters to seek comment.

" the democrat controlled illinois legislature ended its spring session late tuesday, failing to produce a full fiscal 2017 budget to tackle financial woes or even a plan to fund schools. hours before the session ended republican governor bruce rauner chastised democrats for their “stunning failure” on the budget front. “we’re like a banana republic. we can’t manage our money,” he said at a news conference. a house passed budget that rauner vowed to veto for being more than $7 billion short on revenue failed badly in a senate vote. illinois has limped through fiscal 2016 as the only u.s. state without a complete budget, operating under court ordered spending, and continuing and stopgap appropriations.  the governor last year vetoed all but a school funding bill in the democrats’ budget for the fiscal year that ends june 30.  the impasse between rauner and democrats showed no sign of easing and could leave the nation’s fifth largest state runningon a similar autopilot as the new fiscal year begins july 1. vendors, social services providers, state universities, community colleges and others that have received partial or no funding over the last year are reaching breaking point. that in turn could bring widespread operational problems if the state is unable to obtain food, utilities, fuel and other essentials. “real people are going to suffer. real people are going to die,” warned democratic state representative jack franks. the legislature also failed to approve a stand alone k 12 education budget. a $15.7 billion bill to ensure schools open in the fall passed the senate but was soundly defeated in the house.  its demise leaves the financially struggling chicago public schools (cps) without an additional $475 million in funding in part to help pay for rising contributions to teacher pensions. cps officials have warned of “draconian” spending cuts to deal with a $1 billion budget deficit. democratic leaders on tuesday refused to immediately take up rauner’s short term budget plan, shunting it off to a bipartisan working group. future budget deliberations will be complicated by the fact that a tougher, three fifths voting majority to pass a bill kicks in on wednesday.  house speaker michael madigan has made clear his chamber will meet every week during june to work on a budget.  the inability to send rauner a spending plan exposed an unusual level of dysfunction within the democratic party, whose super majorities in both legislative chambers were racked by infighting over how best to confront the 11 month impasse with the governor. the senate’s refusal to adopt a budget plan bearing the clear imprint of madigan, the state party chairman, represented a stinging rebuke to the longest serving statehouse speaker in america and a setback rauner allies called a “catastrophe” for democrats. within the 39 member senate democratic majority, some senators complained they were unable to have input in the house passed plan, which arrived last week as a take it or leave it proposition, one of madigan’s legislative hallmarks over the years in his dealings with illinois’ upper legislative chamber. “there was a lot of resentment over the way it was passed,” said senate president john cullerton. without a budget, illinois, which already has the lowest bond ratings among the 50 states, risks harming its credit standing further. credit rating agencies have warned of downgrades if the state fails to tackle its $111 billion unfunded pension liability and huge structural budget deficit. the governor’s budget office has hired consultants to help disengage from interest rate swap pacts that could cost the state more than $100 million if its ratings fall below specified levels.

" the widow of a slain navy seal whose story was turned into the hit movie “american sniper” has become a prominent figure in fort worth republican politics even though her name does not appear on tuesday’s primary ballot. taya kyle, the wife of chris kyle, is campaign treasurer for a republican opponent of longtime tarrant county sheriff dee anderson, the lawman seen as the face of the manhunt for “affluenza” teen ethan couch. kyle is also in a dispute with her late husband’s former business partner bo french, who is running as a republican for a texas house of representatives seat from the same county.  lawyers for kyle sent a cease and desist letter to the french camp last week calling on it to stop using her husband’s name and likeness in campaign materials. “bo (is) abusing the name of my late husband, a beloved son of texas, and a hero to the nation, in an attempt to manipulate voters,” kyle said in a statement on social media. she did not respond to requests to speak about her political activism. “her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down,” said republican political strategist bill miller. “she’s become a very formidable woman.” chris and taya kyle have become stars of the state’s republican establishment, with governor greg abbott setting up a day to honor the memory of chris kyle, who was killed in 2013 by a troubled veteran he was trying to mentor.  taya kyle last year endorsed former governor rick perry in his unsuccessful bid for the republican presidential nomination. she now endorses u.s. senator ted cruz of texas.  in the sheriff’s race, she may be the difference in the campaign of bill waybourn, a former suburban fort worth police chief, analysts said. waybourn, backed by the conservative tea party movement, is challenging anderson, a fellow republican, who gained national attention in calling for the apprehension of couch. the teen, whose lawyer said his wealth distorted his moral compass, fled to mexico in december apparently to avoid apprehension for violating the probation deal that kept him out of jail for a drunken driving wreck in 2013 that killed four people. kyle, 41, has not indicated any intention to seek elective office, but analysts said that should not be ruled out. “once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, it’s hard to get out,” miller said.

" a possible labour green coalition narrowed the gap with the ruling national party in new zealand s final election tally, strengthening their position ahead of talks on sunday with the small nationalist party which holds the balance of power. the final sept. 23 election results released on saturday showed national won 56 seats and labour and greens together took 54 seats, leaving them both reliant on new zealand first s nine seats to meet the 61 seats needed for a majority in parliament in new zealand s proportional representation system. national lost two seats to the labour green bloc compared with preliminary results   a development which labour leader jacinda ardern said buoyed their position at the negotiating table.  we will continue our negotiations in earnest with potential support parties beginning this weekend,  ardern told reporters in auckland.  this now means that we have a strengthened mandate to negotiate and form a durable, stable coalition government.  ardern, 37, took over the labour leadership nearly two months before the election, quickly drawing comparisons with youthful, cosmopolitan leaders like canada s justin trudeau and france s emmanuel macron. she has almost single handedly brought labour to within reach of forming government. new zealand first said in an emailed statement that it would hold discussions on sunday with the national party at midday and with the labour party in the afternoon.  new zealand first leader winston peters told local media that knowing the facts  puts us in a better position to make judgements . peters has said he would only make a decision on which party to back after the final tally and after the results become official on oct. 12. prime minister bill english told reporters in queenstown that the final results did not change the nature of the negotiations, which would now likely focus on the economy.  i don t think it weakens it significantly at all,  he said, referring to national s negotiating position.  the fundamentals haven t altered, and that is national has significantly more seats than labour, we are larger than a labour greens combination.  if new zealand first chooses to go with labour, which are thought to have more in common in terms of policy, the gain in seats for the labour greens bloc would make it easier for peters to justify the move, analysts said. both parties have said they want to curb immigration, renegotiate certain trade deals and adjust the role of the central bank albeit in different ways.  if labour, the greens and nz first had formed a government with a majority of one (seat)...that wouldn t have sat comfortably with many people,  richard shaw, politics professor at massey university, referring to preliminary results. a labour, greens, nz first coalition would now hold a three seat majority after the final tally. but some say peters could be swayed to go to national given it would be a straightforward coalition between two parties. peters, a veteran new zealand politician who has now held the balance of power three times, has in past elections formed coalition governments with both the national party and labour. the national party won 44.4 percent of the votes, the labour party 36.9 percent, new zealand first 7.2 percent, the green party 6.3 percent.

" the investigation into possible russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election will enter a new phase as early as monday, when the first charges resulting from the probe could be unsealed and a target taken into custody. a federal grand jury approved the indictment on friday and a federal judge ordered it sealed, a source briefed on the matter has told reuters, adding it could be unsealed as soon as monday. the indictment could mark a dramatic turn in special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into allegations of russian interference in the 2016 race and any possible links with officials from president donald trump’s campaign. the russia investigation has cast a shadow over trump’s 9 month old presidency and widened the partisan rift between republicans and democrats. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded in january that russia interfered in the election to try to help trump defeat democrat hillary clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her. mueller, a former director of the federal bureau of investigation, has been looking into possible links between trump aides and foreign governments, as well as potential money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, according to sources familiar with the probe. he also is exploring whether trump or his aides have tried to obstruct the investigation. mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after trump’s may 9 firing of fbi director james comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with russia. trump initially said he fired comey because his leadership of the fbi was inadequate. in a later interview with nbc, he cited “this russia thing” as his reason. trump has denied the allegations of collusion with the russians and called the probe “a witch hunt.” the kremlin also has denied the allegations. on sunday, trump tried to shift the focus back to democrats and clinton, tweeting that the russia issue was being used to sidetrack the republican push for tax reform and praising republican “anger and unity” on the need to look into whether democrats and the clinton campaign paid for a portion of a dossier that detailed accusations about trump’s ties to russia. special white house counsel ty cobb said the president’s tweets “are unrelated to the activities of the special counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate.” investigators led by mueller have interviewed former white house chief of staff reince priebus, former spokesman sean spicer and other current and former white house and campaign officials. in july, fbi agents raided the virginia home of trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro russian political party in ukraine are being investigated by mueller’s team. mueller also has investigated michael flynn, an adviser to trump’s campaign and later his national security adviser. flynn was fired from that post in february after misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations with russian ambassador sergei kislyak last year. the indictment in mueller’s probe was first reported by cnn, which said the target could be taken into custody on monday. that possibility spurred some of trump’s conservative allies to call for mueller’s firing. sebastian gorka, an outspoken former adviser who left the white house in august, said on twitter that mueller “should be stripped of his authority” and investigated if he executed warrants in the probe. the white house said in the summer that trump had no intention of firing mueller even though he questioned his impartiality. republicans also criticized leaks to the press about the indictment and raised the possibility that those responsible could be prosecuted. but republican senator rob portman said on nbc’s “meet the press” that trump had been “too defensive” about the russia probe. he said there should be broad outrage about russia’s attempted meddling.

" the united states has recovered an inert hellfire air to ground missile that had mistakenly ended up in cuba, u.s. and cuban officials said on saturday. the laser guided agm 114 hellfire mistakenly arrived in cuba in june 2014 and was retrieved on saturday by u.s. officials and representatives of lockheed martin corp, the missile’s owner, the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. “we can say, without speaking to specifics, that the inert training missile has been returned with the cooperation of the cuban government,” state department spokesman mark toner said in a statement. lockheed martin spokesman bill phelps declined comment. the missile had been sent to europe for a training exercise in 2014 but somehow ended up in cuba in an embarrassing loss of military technology, the wall street journal reported last month. “the department is restricted under federal law and regulations from commenting on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters, so we cannot provide further details,” toner said. but he said reestablished diplomatic relations between the two countries have helped the u.s. “engage with the cuban government on issues of mutual interest.” cuba said the missile arrived by mistake or mishandling on a commercial flight from paris and was not listed on the cargo manifest, and that it was discovered by customs inspectors. “once the u.s. government officially informed the cuban government that a training missile belonging to the company lockheed martin was mistakenly sent to our country and expressed its interest in recovering it, cuba communicated the decision to hand it over and started arrangements for its return,” the cuban statement said, without revealing when the united states made the request. a team of u.s. government and lockheed martin experts took the missile back to the united states on saturday, cuba said.

" a group of investigative journalists whose slogan is  digging dung, fertilizing democracy  is holding south african president jacob zuma to account over his widely criticized links to a family of wealthy businessmen. amabhungane, which means dung beetles in the zulu language,  was founded by three veteran reporters to expose wrongdoing in south africa. together with online news site the daily maverick, amabhungane in june released leaked emails and documents that they said showed allegedly improper dealings in government contracts and influence peddling by the guptas, a family with close ties to zuma. zuma and the gupta family, which has said the emails were fake, have denied wrongdoing. co founder stefaans brummer said amabhungane, which was founded in 2010, had spent several years probing zuma s family business dealings, and had verified the authenticity of the leaked documents.  our very first stories as amabhungane was a series called  zuma inc  and we looked at the zuma family and how its business fortunes had grown since zuma took the office of president,  brummer said.  he said the gupta name popped up in several of amabhungane s inquiries into zuma s family business links and the organization was well placed to process the trove of information in more than 100,000 emails and documents.  you fight hard for every piece of information and when something like this happens it s like christmas, you suddenly have a lot of information,  said brummer. brummer said amabhungane, which mostly uses external hard drives to store documents for safety reasons, had sent a copy of the leaked gupta emails to the organized crime and corruption reporting project   a global consortium of investigative journalism centers. reuters has not independently been able to verify the allegations in the so called  guptaleaks  emails, sent between the gupta brothers and their associates. the allegations, which came after an anti corruption watchdog report into claims of influence peddling, opened zuma up to renewed scrutiny and deepened divisions within the ruling african national congress. zuma survived an attempt in parliament to force him from office on aug. 8, but he was left politically wounded after some anc members voted with the opposition.   it s quite amazing that people in south africa have woken up to  state capture  now in 2017 when amabhungane have been exposing this for a decade,  said glenda daniels, a senior media studies lecturer at the university of the witwatersrand.  perhaps the nature of their exposes were rather intense and detailed for people to follow. maybe they have now let some air into their writing and everyone is getting it.  as a non profit company, amabhungane s 8 million rand  ($600,000) annual budget is funded by grants from charitable foundations and public donations. it does not sell adverts or accept funds from the government or from companies. sam sole, another amabhungane co founder, said his desire to expose society s injustices drove him into journalism. both sole and brummer started their journalism careers before the end of apartheid in 1994.  during my subsequent conscription into the defense force i came face to face with the sharp, brutish reality of apartheid   and that was the impetus for my first piece of journalism,  said sole.  journalism, for me, was a way to fight against injustice.  the third amabhungane co founder, adriaan basson, is now editor of news24, an online news site. sole and brummer have won numerous journalism awards, including for their reporting on a 30 billion rand ($2.3 billion) deal to buy military equipment in the late 1990s that was plagued by allegations of fraud and corruption.  zuma was linked to the deal through his former financial adviser, who was jailed for corruption. the president said last year that an investigation into the deal found no evidence of wrongdoing, but critics denounced the findings as a cover up. all charges against zuma were dropped in 2009, but a court last year ordered a review of the decision. zuma is appealing the ruling.  the arms deal scandal lasted much longer and was much slower burning, which gave us time to develop some of the skills we use now,  sole said. for amabhungane, the aim was to probe the link between politics and money.  we set ourselves a target of trying to find that sweet spot of where organized crime, politics and business intersect,  brummer said.  politics has its good side but it has its bad side, business has its good side and its bad side, organized crime is all bad, but there is always that intersection where the three come together and that s where you get the worst wrongdoing.   but amabhungane has been accused by a group called black first land first and some on social media of being run by  racist white men  and not doing enough stories on  white monopoly capital , a phrase used to describe the fact that the white minority still control much of the economy. brummer said the criticism has not deterred amabhungane.  we are not going to roll over and die. investigative journalism is what we do and what we like to do,  he said.

" a top aide to u.s. president donald trump on sunday defended his colleague, kellyanne conway, after she was widely criticized for her public endorsement of the fashion line of trump’s daughter, ivanka. speaking on abc’s “this week” program, white house aide stephen miller said trump adviser conway was making a “light hearted, flippant” comment when she urged americans to buy ivanka trump’s products. conway’s comments prompted criticism from both republican and democratic lawmakers, as well as some legal experts who said she may have violated ethics rules that prohibit using a public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. in comments to the associated press last week, republican jason chaffetz, chairman of the house of representatives oversight committee, said conway’s statement was “clearly over the line, unacceptable.” elijah cummings, the top democrat on the same committee, said on sunday that miller’s characterization of conway’s remarks was incorrect. “this was a textbook case of a violation of the law,” he said on “this week.”  cummings said he was troubled by the fact that trump is the authority who will ultimately decide how to punish conway, if at all, after the office of government ethics issues its recommendation on the matter. conway made the comments after retailer nordstrom said it would stop selling ivanka trump’s clothing line, a move that had prompted a tweet from the president blasting nordstrom. nordstrom said it had made the decision to drop the brand because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line “didn’t make good business sense.” nordstrom shares initially fell after the president’s criticism last wednesday, but closed up 4 percent on the new york stock exchange that day. on saturday, a spokesman for major u.s. retailers sears and kmart said they had removed 31 trump home items from their online product offerings in order to focus on more profitable merchandise.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe sent a ritual offering to the yasukuni shrine for war dead, seen in china and the two koreas as a symbol of japan s past militarism, to mark its annual autumn festival, the shrine said on tuesday. abe was expected to refrain from visiting the shrine during the festival, which will last until friday, the nikkei business daily and kyodo news agency reported. he is scheduled to visit northern japan, akita prefecture and yamagata prefecture, for an election campaign stump on tuesday, kyodo news said. his ruling coalition is on track for a big win in sunday s general election   even though almost half the country s voters don t want him to keep his job, a media survey showed on monday. abe s snap election comes amid heightened global tension following north korea s nuclear tests and missile launches, which prompted the u.n. security council to impose fresh sanctions. health minister katsunobu kato also sent an ritual offering to the shrine, a spokesperson for the shrine said. past visits to yasukuni by japanese leaders have outraged beijing and seoul because it honors 14 japanese leaders convicted by an allied tribunal as war criminals, along with japan s war dead. china s position on the shrine was clear, foreign ministry spokesman lu kang told reporters in beijing.  we urge the japanese side to earnestly, squarely and deeply reflect on their history of aggression, appropriately handle the relevant issue and take actual steps to win the trust of their asian neighbors and the international community,  lu said. abe has only visited the shrine in person once, in december 2013, since becoming premier the previous year.  rather than attend in person, abe sends a ritual offering on several occasions in an effort to improve ties with china and south korea, which have been strained by territorial and other disputes. japan, china and south korea are trying to hold a summit meeting this year, the nikkei business said.

" a campaign group seeking a global ban on nuclear arms won the nobel peace prize on friday, given the award by a nobel committee that cited the spread of weapons to north korea and said the risk was growing of nuclear war. the award to the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons (ican) was unexpected, particularly in a year when the architects of the 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and iran had been seen as favorites for achieving the sort of diplomatic breakthrough that has won the prize in the past. (graphics on 'nobel laureates'   here) supporters described the award as a potential breakthrough for a global movement that has fought to ban nuclear arms from the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima in august 1945. ican s executive director beatrice fihn told reuters the group was elated.  this. is. surreal.  she later tweeted. asked if she had a message for north korea s kim jong un, who has tested nuclear arms in defiance of global pressure, and president donald trump, who has threatened to  totally destroy  north korea to protect the united states and its allies, fihn said both leaders need to know that the weapons are illegal.  nuclear weapons are illegal. threatening to use nuclear weapons is illegal. having nuclear weapons, possessing nuclear weapons, developing nuclear weapons, is illegal, and they need to stop,  she told reuters.  two days before her group won the prize, fihn had tweeted that trump was  a moron . she told reuters she had written this in jest, in the context of news reports that u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson had used the same word to describe his boss. but she said trump s impulsive character illustrated the importance of banning nuclear arms for all countries.  a man you can bait with a tweet seems to be taking irrational decisions very quickly and not listening to expertise, it just puts a spotlight on what do nuclear weapons really mean. there are no right hands for the wrong weapons,  she said. ican describes itself as a coalition of grassroots non government groups in more than 100 nations. it began in australia and was officially launched in vienna in 2007. in her speech announcing the prize, berit reiss andersen, the leader of the norwegian nobel committee, said the risk that nuclear weapons might be used was now  greater than it has been for a long time .  some states are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by north korea.  the award was hailed by anti nuclear campaigners around the world.  now more than ever we need a world without nuclear weapons,  united nations secretary general antonio guterres tweeted. mikiso iwasa, an 88 year old hiroshima survivor, told reuters the prize would help push the movement forward.  it is wonderful we have this nobel peace prize winning movement. all of us need to join forces, think hard and walk forward together to turn this momentum into something even bigger,  he said. the prize seeks to bolster the case for disarmament amid nuclear tensions between washington and pyongyang, as well as uncertainty over the fate of the 2015 deal between iran and major powers to limit tehran s nuclear program. the prize giving committee made no mention of iran in its award citation. it raised eyebrows with its decision to award the prize to an international campaign group with a relatively low profile, rather than recognize the iran deal, a complex agreement hammered out over years of high stakes diplomacy.  norwegian nobel committee has its own ways, but the nuclear agreement with iran achieved something real and would have deserved a prize,  tweeted carl bildt, a former swedish prime minister who has held top posts as an international diplomat. the iran accord, which trump has repeatedly called  the worst deal ever negotiated , is seen as under particular threat this week. a senior administration official said on thursday trump is expected to  decertify  the pact, a step which could allow congress to restore sanctions on iran. the committee may have been reluctant to reward the iranian government for its role in the nuclear deal because the only iranian winner so far, 2003 laureate shirin ebadi, a lawyer and human rights campaigner, is forced to live in exile.  i think the committee has thought about the human rights situation in iran. it would have been difficult to explain the prize even though it has a favorable view of the iran deal,  asle sveen, a historian of the nobel peace prize, told reuters.  the norwegian nobel committee denied that giving the prize to an anti nuclear group was intended either as a rebuke to trump, or as a snub to the architects of the iran nuclear deal.  the iran treaty is a positive development, a disarmament development that is positive, but the reason we mentioned north korea (in our statement) is a reference to the threat that people actually feel,  reiss andersen told reuters.  iran has not voiced recent threats to use nuclear weapons.  ican has campaigned for a u.n. treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in july this year. that agreement is not signed by   and would not apply to   any of the states that already have nuclear arms, which include the five u.n. security council permanent members, the united states, russia, china, britain and france, as well as india, pakistan and north korea. israel is also widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it. major allies of the declared nuclear powers also oppose the new treaty. nevertheless, campaigners see it as a framework that would make it easier for countries that have nuclear arms to work toward eliminating them. nato member norway congratulated ican but said it would not sign the treaty to ban nuclear weapons. the nobel peace prize is awarded by a committee appointed by the norwegian parliament.  norway will not support proposals in the un that would weaken nato s role as a defence alliance,  prime minister erna solberg said. nuclear armed nations, including the united states and russia, back the u.n. s 1968 nuclear non proliferation treaty which sets limits on the spread of atomic weapons and has a long term goal of nuclear disarmament.  there is a strong logic in this peace prize,  said dan smith, director of the stockholm international peace research institute  it s all about encouraging governments to do what they have promised to do in the non proliferation treaty.

" the white house’s 2018 budget plan for the u.s. department of energy includes $120 million for nuclear waste programs including the restart of licensing for nevada’s yucca mountain, a project stalled for years by lawsuits and local opposition. the move signals that president donald trump may consider that nuclear waste solutions could extend the lives of existing u.s. nuclear power plants and speed up innovations in next  generation nuclear plants that backers say are safer than previous reactors.   congress will debate the budget and it is uncertain whether funds for waste will remain in the plan. while yucca mountain would store waste on a practically permanent basis, the budget money would also support programs for storing waste at interim sites before yucca opens.  “these investments would accelerate progress on fulfilling the federal government’s obligations to address nuclear waste, enhance national security, and reduce future taxpayer burden,” according to a summary of the budget. yucca has been studied by the u.s. government since the 1970s as a potential repository for the nation’s radioactive waste and billions of dollars have been spent on it. but yucca has never opened because of legal challenges and widespread opposition from local politicians, environmentalists and native american groups. in 2010, then president barack obama withdrew the license to store waste at yucca amid opposition from then senate majority leader harry reid, a fellow democrat from nevada. maria korsnick, the head of the nuclear energy institute industry group, said the industry was encouraged by the plan for waste projects but that nuclear energy innovators were “nervous” about cuts to programs that have supported public private partnerships to bring new nuclear technologies to market. the budget eliminates funding for the advanced research projects agency for energy and an innovative technology loan guarantee program that have been popular with both democrats and many republicans.    trump’s energy secretary, rick perry, told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that restarting the yucca mountain project could not be ruled out, but that he would collaborate with states. “i am very aware that this is an issue this country has been flummoxed by for 30 years. we have spent billions of dollars on this issue,” perry told the hearing in january. “i’ll work closely with you and the members of this committee to find the answers to this issue.” the white house proposal for the department of energy budget calls for an overall cut of 5.6 percent.

" the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation will shut down its fundraising affiliates in sweden and the united kingdom if hillary clinton wins the u.s. presidency in november, a spokesman for the global charity said this week. the foundation has in recent weeks begun announcing planned new donor restrictions to allay criticism that wealthy supporters might be expecting special treatment from the u.s. government in return. both the william j. clinton foundation uk in london and the clinton foundation insamlingsstiftelse in stockholm will close if clinton becomes president because of their acceptance of foreign funding, brian cookstra, a spokesman for the clinton foundation in new york, said in one of a series of emails responding to questions from reuters. both organizations exist to receive donations overseas, neither have any employees, and they are overseen by board members of the main clinton foundation in the united states, their financial statements show. some of the foundation’s foreign outposts have drawn extra scrutiny because donors can give money anonymously.  the foundation said last month it would no longer accept foreign funding for at least some of its work if clinton is elected, although donald trump, clinton’s republican rival for the presidency, continues to accuse clinton of being corrupted by foreign donors. she has dismissed this as a political smear. in order to become president barack obama’s secretary of state in 2009, clinton signed an ethics agreement promising to annually publish the names of all donors to her family’s philanthropy, including foreign governments that have collectively given tens of millions of dollars.  clinton also promised that her charities would seek prior approval from the state department’s ethics office before accepting new donations from foreign governments. the charities have since conceded they did not keep these promises, blaming oversights. (reut.rs/2c7iqgk) the foundation’s outpost in stockholm has received nearly 270 million swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while clinton was still secretary of state.  most of this money was given by the swedish postcode lottery and the dutch postcode lottery, according to the clinton foundation insamlingsstiftelse’s website. about $6 million came from other donors that are not disclosed by the clinton foundation insamlingsstiftelse. cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main clinton foundation’s website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in sweden rather than the united states. the foundation also declined to explain a discrepancy in donations in records from 2012. the swedish postcode lottery foundation said it donated 6.6 million crowns (about $1 million) that year, but the clinton foundation reported this amount as 19.7 million crowns (about $3 million). cookstra also declined to say whether the foundation has other fundraising arms set up in foreign countries besides the united kingdom and sweden. the british arm of the clinton foundation has raised at least $400,000 since 2007, according to records held by the british government’s charity commission. the state department says it has no record of being notified about the foundation’s overseas outposts during clinton’s tenure. “the state department was not responsible for monitoring or approving the organization and operation of the clinton foundation or its offshoots,” elizabeth trudeau, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “the department reviewed all information submitted to it. you would need to ask the foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for state department review.” ",0
" cuba urged the united states on friday to cooperate with its investigation into incidents that the u.s. says have harmed its diplomats in havana and not to politicize the matter, days after washington said it was considering closing its cuban embassy. in an address to the united nations general assembly, cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez said the top level of the government in havana had ordered an investigation into the mysterious matter, which threatens the fragile detente between the old cold war foes. however, a cuban government source told reuters that the united states had provided no evidence of the harm, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea, that it says u.s. diplomats and their relatives based in havana have suffered. cuban doctors had also not been allowed to examine anyone, the source said. a spokesman for the u.s. embassy in havana declined to comment.  the investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the u.s. authorities,  rodriguez told the u.n.  it would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized,  said rodriguez. cuba has denied any involvement in the affair. u.s. senator marco rubio of florida was among five republican senators that a week ago called for u.s. president donald trump to retaliate against cuba by expelling its diplomats and possibly shuttering the u.s. embassy in havana. rubio helped forge trump s new cuba policy, rolling back parts of the detente achieved under democratic former president barack obama and taking a harder line on the communist run island. cuba s state run media this week said the only party interested in a deterioration in relations were a small group of republicans led by rubio. the u.s. government in august first officially confirmed they were investigating the incidents it said began in late 2016. several canadians were also affected, a canadian official said, further deepening the mystery. the last incident to affect a u.s. citizen occurred late in august, bringing the number of those with symptoms to 21, a u.s. state department official said last week. some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, the u.s. official said, while others had been tested in cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. investigations by cuba, the united states and canada have yet to come up with any answers. experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of cuban american exiles or third party state actors such as russia, iran or north korea, but most flounder. audiologists for example have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

" u.s. president donald trump does not plan to invoke executive privilege as a way to block former fbi director james comey from testifying to congress next week, the new york times said on friday citing two unnamed senior administration officials. on saturday, a white house spokesperson referred a question about the times’ story to outside council. outside council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  comey was leading a federal bureau of investigation probe into alleged russian meddling in last year’s u.s. presidential election and possible collusion by trump’s campaign when the president fired him last month. on friday, white house officials said that they did not know yet whether president donald trump would seek to block comey’s testimony, a move that could spark a political backlash. “i have not spoken to counsel yet. i don’t know how they’re going to respond,” white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on friday. the former fbi chief is due to testify on thursday before the senate intelligence committee as part of its own russia related investigation, and his remarks could cause problems for the republican president. presidents can assert executive privilege to prevent government employees from sharing information. however, legal experts say it is not clear whether certain conversations between trump and comey that the president has talked about publicly would be covered, and any effort to block comey, who is now a private citizen, from testifying could be challenged in court.

" democrat hillary clinton went on the attack against rival bernie sanders on thursday in their most contentious presidential debate yet, questioning whether his ambitious proposals were viable and accusing him of an “artful smear” in suggesting she could be bought by political donations. sanders fought back repeatedly, questioning clinton’s progressive credentials and portraying her as a creature of the political establishment in a debate that featured heated exchanges on healthcare, college tuition funding and efforts to rein in wall street. the intensity reflected a race that has seen clinton’s once prohibitive lead in polls shrivel against sanders as the two vie for the democratic nomination for the nov. 8 election. one of clinton’s most forceful remarks came in response to a suggestion by sanders that she could be influenced by political donations by wall street.  “enough is enough. if you’ve got something to say, say it directly,” she said. “but you will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that i ever received. “so i think it’s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out,” she said. clinton charged that sanders’ proposal for single payer universal healthcare coverage would jeopardize obamacare, calling it “a great mistake,” and said his plans for free college education would be too costly to be realistic. “i can get things done. i’m not making promises i can’t keep,” clinton said. sanders said he would not dismantle obamacare but would expand it, pointing to the many other countries that provide universal healthcare. “i do not accept the belief that the united states of america can’t do that,” sanders said. “by moving forward, rallying the american people, i do believe we should have healthcare for all.” sanders said his proposal for free tuition at public universities would be paid with a tax on wall street speculation. “the middle class bailed out wall street in their time of need. now, it is wall street’s time to help the middle class,” he said. five days before new hampshire holds the second of the state by state presidential nominating contests, opinion polls show sanders, a u.s. senator from neighboring vermont, with a double digit lead over clinton after surprising the front runner by finishing just barely behind her in iowa on monday. clinton seemed energized by her underdog status in new hampshire, delivering her most aggressive debate performance of the campaign. it was reminiscent of her 2008 run against barack obama, when she also began as the front runner but became a sharper and less cautious candidate as she began to lose. the debate was the first since former maryland governor martin o’malley dropped out on monday after a poor finish in iowa, giving the two candidates more freedom to directly engage each other. sanders accused clinton of representing “the establishment,” while saying he represented “ordinary working americans.” he also noted her super pac had taken contributions from wall street firms and that clinton received big speaking fees from goldman sachs. clinton disputed the establishment label, saying it was “quite amusing” to accuse “a woman, running to be the first woman president, as the establishment.” the two battled over who best represented progressive ideals. sanders said he would lead a “political revolution,” but clinton questioned his ability to get his proposals through a republican led congress. “a progressive is someone who makes progress,” she said. and she attacked sanders’ own credentials as a progressive, bringing up his votes against the 1993 brady bill that mandated federal background checks on gun purchases and his 2005 vote for a bill to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. “if we’re going to get into labels, i don’t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the brady bill five times,” she said. “i don’t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.”  sanders repeated his earlier pledge not to attack clinton on the controversy over her use of a private email account and a private server for government business when she was secretary of state. “i will not politicize it,” he said. but sanders renewed his attacks on clinton for her senate vote to authorize the u.s. invasion of iraq, which she has since called a mistake. he pointed out he voted against the war, which he said had led to the rise of the islamic state militant group. “look we did differ,” clinton responded. “a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis. “we have to look at the threats that we face right now.” clinton has tried to play down expectations for her performance in new hampshire, where she came from behind for an upset victory in the 2008 campaign just days after losing badly to obama in iowa. the surprisingly strong performance by sanders in iowa is likely to prolong a race that clinton entered as the presumptive front runner. in addition to previously scheduled debates in wisconsin and florida, the candidates added one in march in flint, michigan, to draw attention to the city’s contaminated water crisis ahead of the michigan primary. they also will debate in april and may.

" the man forecast to replace cuban president raul castro early next year rejected u.s. demands that the communist run country change its political and economic system. in a sunday speech blasting u.s. pressure on the venezuelan government and what he termed an effort to discredit the cuban tourism industry, first vice president miguel diaz canel said these and other recent events in the region proved  imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never.   diaz canel was quoting ernesto che guevara at a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the revolutionary who had helped lead a bolivian uprising modeled after cuba s.  cuba will not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence, nor negotiate its principles or accept the imposition of conditions,  diaz canel said, apparently responding to u.s. president donald trump s recent statement at the united nations that sanctions would not be lifted until the caribbean island restores democracy and capitalism.  the changes needed in cuba will solely be carried out by the cuban people,  diaz canel said. castro, 86, has announced he will step down as president in february. experts expect diaz canel, 57, to become the first head of state since the early 1960s without castro as a last name. there are no direct elections in cuba for national office. trump said in june that he would once more tighten sanctions on cuba and seek a better deal from the country than the gradual detente achieved by predecessor barack obama. the trump administration has drastically reduced staffing at its embassy in cuba and ordered a reciprocal reduction of cuban diplomats in washington due to a series of alleged  health attacks  on u.s. personnel in havana. the united states has not blamed cuba for the still unsolved incidents but holds it responsible for not protecting its personnel. the administration has also issued a travel warning stating u.s. citizens might be targeted.  some unnamed officials are propagating unusual nonsense without any evidence, with the perverse aim of discrediting the impeccable reputation of our country as a safe destination for foreign visitors, including from the united states,  diaz canel said.

" billionaire environmental activist tom steyer, who has spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on tuesday he will spend whatever it takes to fight president elect donald trump’s pro drilling and anti regulation agenda. the former hedge fund manager from california is putting together a strategy that will “engage voters and citizens to fight back” once trump takes the white house in january, he told reuters in an interview. however, he stressed he was not planning to fight trump through the courts. instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.” steyer’s pledge to fight trump suggests an intensifying battle for u.s. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence. other u.s. environmental groups are also preparing to resist trump’s agenda, with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped draft some of president barack obama’s environmental regulations preparing to defend them in court. “we have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,” steyer said, when asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose trump’s agenda. trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulation and ease permitting for infrastructure, moves he said would breathe life into an oil and gas industry ailing from low prices, without harming u.s. air and water quality.  he has also called climate change a hoax and has promised to “cancel” the paris climate accord between nearly 200 nations to slow global warming, a deal he said would cost the u.s. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage. while the approach has cheered the industry, it has sent shockwaves through the environmental movement, which is confronting the prospect of losing all progress it made during the obama administration. steyer, who had endorsed democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, called trump’s policies dangerous. “every single one of these things, whether it was getting rid of paris or cutting back the epa, we think are extremely dangerous to the security of every american,” steyer said. “we think it is based on willful ignorance of the facts and flies in the face of the realities facing the world.” steyer’s main political vehicle, nextgen climate, on tuesday called on the obama administration to defy trump’s pro drilling agenda by issuing an order permanently blocking all new drilling in the atlantic and arctic oceans. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  trump has also promised to ask canadian oil pipeline company, transcanada corp, to resubmit its application to build a pipeline into the united states that would link alberta’s vast oil sands to american refineries and ports on the gulf coast. the project, keystone xl, had been rejected by the obama administration after years of mass protests and lobbying by environmental organizations. steyer said the project may no longer make sense since a slump in oil prices has reduced the profitability of oil sands production. steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co founded to devote himself full time to environmental activism, said young voter turnout in areas where nextgen focused its mobilization efforts during the 2016 campaign was up more than 20 percent from the last presidential election in 2012. “did we get the president we want, absolutely not. did we get a majority of clean energy supporters in the senate, no,” steyer said. “but in terms of what we did, and the strategy we took, we wouldn’t do anything differently.”  nextgen poured nearly $69 million into its elections related programs during the presidential campaign, according to federal records compiled by opensecrets.org, slightly lower than the $74 million it spent during the mid term congressional elections in 2014, when only two of the six candidates it supported won.

" u.s. senator john mccain said on sunday he would like relations between united states and pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the islamic state and other radical islamist groups. relations between pakistan and united states have been frayed over the past decade, with u.s. officials frustrated by what they term islamabad’s unwillingness to act against islamist groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network. pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple islamist groups and is wary of “blowback” in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  mccain, visiting pakistan as part of a u.s. delegation, said he had an “excellent meeting” with pakistani foreign ministry officials. “we come back with a message that we have a common enemy in isis, radical islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,” mccain told pakistan’s national ptv channel. relations between united states and pakistan were tested again in may by a u.s. drone strike that killed afghan taliban chief mullah akhtar mansour on pakistani soil.  as part of the visit, mccain traveled to miranshah, the capital of the restive north waziristan region bordering afghanistan. the region was effectively run islamists by groups such as the pakistani taliban and the haqqani network until the pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. “i was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),” said mccain, who is the chairman of the senate armed services committee. “i see us working together in confronting a common challenge – radical islamic terrorism – and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,” mccain added. the islamic state has struggled to gain a major foothold in pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  pakistan said the country’s top foreign policy official sartaj aziz had briefed the u.s. delegation   which includes senators lindsey graham, benjamin sasse and joe donnelly   about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in afghanistan. so far china, united states and pakistan have struggled to persuade the afghan taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. “no country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as pakistan, (aziz) remarked,” pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

" president donald trump’s son donald trump jr., son in law jared kushner and former campaign manager paul manafort have been asked to appear before u.s. senate committees next week to answer questions about the campaign’s alleged connections to russia, officials said on wednesday. the three men are the closest associates of the president to be called to speak to lawmakers involved in probing russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and possible collusion with the trump campaign. trump, who came into office in january, has been dogged by allegations that his campaign officials were connected to russia, which u.s. intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in last year’s election.  trump has denied any collusion.  the u.s. senate judiciary committee said on wednesday that it had called trump’s eldest son, donald trump jr., and  manafort to testify on july 26 at a hearing. the president’s son released emails earlier this month that showed him eagerly agreeing to meet last year with a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. the meeting was also attended by manafort and kushner, who is now a senior adviser at the white house. kushner is scheduled to be interviewed by the senate intelligence committee on monday, july 24, behind closed doors. “working with and being responsive to the schedules of the committees, we have arranged mr. kushner’s interview with the senate for july 24,” kushner’s attorney, abbe lowell, said in a statement. “he will continue to cooperate and appreciates the opportunity to assist in putting this matter to rest.” a special counsel, robert mueller, is also conducting an investigation of russian meddling in the u.s. election and any collusion between moscow and trump’s campaign.  the issue has overshadowed trump’s tenure in office and irritated the president, who told the new york times on wednesday that he would not have appointed ally and former senator jeff sessions as attorney general if he had known sessions would recuse himself from oversight of the russia probe. “sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else,” trump said in the interview. senator sheldon whitehouse, a democratic member of the judiciary committee, said the committee’s hearing would enable the panel to begin to get testimony under oath. “there has been an enormous amount that has been said publicly but it’s not under oath, which means that people are free to omit matters or lie with relative impunity,” whitehouse told cnn. the senate intelligence committee is conducting one of the main investigations of russia’s meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and possible collusion by trump associates, but the judiciary committee has been looking into related issues. the public judiciary hearing on wednesday will look into rules governing the registration of agents working for foreign governments in the united states and foreign attempts to influence u.s. elections. chuck grassley, the committee’s republican chairman, has said he wanted to question the trump associates, but has also raised concerns about why the obama administration allowed natalia veselnitskaya, the russian lawyer who attended the trump tower meeting in june, into the united states.  he also has called before the committee and threatened to subpoena glenn simpson, a co founder of fusion gps, a firm that commissioned former british intelligence agent christopher steele to dig up opposition research on trump, when he was a presidential candidate.

" disagreement among u.s. congressional republicans is already swirling around a tax cut plan unveiled days ago by president donald trump, who has proposed repealing the tax on inheritances and eliminating a deduction for state and local tax payments. the discord shows the difficulty of overhauling the complex u.s. tax code. this task has defied washington since 1986, the last time a comprehensive rewrite was completed despite lobbyists who defend each tax break. trump has yet to score a major legislative win since taking office in january and is pushing hard for a tax code revamp. but his plan is meeting the same internal republican tensions between moderates and conservatives that have sunk his efforts this year to repeal the obamacare health law. “there’s a lot of give and take,” trump economic adviser gary cohn told fox business network on friday.  members of the administration “have been meeting everyday with the tax writers trying to figure out where they need to end up to get the votes ... we’re going to make sure the president gets what he asks for,” he added. one obstacle is the projected fiscal impact of the plan, which would slash u.s. revenues and expand the federal deficit and the national debt, which now exceeds $20 trillion. republican lawmakers from high tax states such as new york exited meetings this week with kevin brady, chairman of the house of representatives’ tax writing committee, saying there would be some sort of compromise on repealing the deduction for state and local tax payments. separately, some republican senators were questioning the repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples. that tax affects only about 0.2 percent of estates, according to the tax policy center, a washington think tank. “that is not a priority for me as we seek to craft this tax bill,” senator susan collins, who has often been a key republican vote, said in a statement on thursday. republicans want to use a procedure known as budget reconciliation to pass eventual tax legislation, which allows passage with a simple majority in the 100 seat senate. republicans hold 52 senate seats and can only afford to lose support from two senators, with vice president mike pence able to cast a tie breaking vote. democrats will likely oppose the legislation.  one republican fiscal hawk, senator bob corker, has already said he cannot support tax legislation that adds to the annual federal deficit. “we remain very bearish on any tax legislation passing this year   or next,” cowen and co analyst chris krueger said in a friday research note. the trump plan, made public last week, calls for up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. without accompanying spending reductions, the budget would hugely expand the deficit, according to some estimates.  the administration contends tax cuts would spur so much economic growth that the resulting new revenues would help offset the cost. in addition, republicans are proposing “revenue raisers,” such as ending the deduction for payments of state and local tax, known as salt. doing that would raise about $1.3 trillion over a decade, the tax policy center said. almost 30 percent of taxpayers currently deduct state and local taxes. in new jersey, for example, 41 percent of tax filers, meaning individuals or married couples, claimed the deduction, which averaged $17,850, according to a government finance officers association analysis of internal revenue service data. although the deduction disproportionately benefits people in high tax states and localities, individuals in all states claim it. in georgia, for example, 33 percent of tax filers claim an average deduction of $9,158, the report said. republican representative chris collins of new york, a trump ally, told reporters earlier this week that lawmakers from high tax states, such as his own, were discussing “ways to level the playing field,” including capping the amount of the deduction or putting other limits on it. “there are many districts with republican members where state and local deduction is used by a large portion of the taxpayers,” said frank sammartino, a senior fellow at the tax policy center. “so it’s not surprising that it’s not strictly a blue state/red state thing.” senate democratic leader chuck schumer called the state and local tax deduction the “achilles’ heel” of tax reform and said his party would oppose any move to repeal it. he dismissed compromise plans as unfeasible. brady said on thursday that at this point there has been no change to the framework, but tax writers are “listening very carefully” to lawmakers’ concerns. “it’s got to be frustrating when you’re in a state where local and state officials really put the screws to taxpayers,” brady told reporters. “we are determined to provide tax relief to every american, regardless of where they live.” ",0

"it has just come to light that stanislav petrov, a former soviet lieutenant colonel, passed away on may 19 this year in his apartment in the small town of fryazino, northeast of moscow. you have probably never heard of him, but if it weren t for petrov s actions (or lack thereof), there is a good chance you wouldn t be here to read this today.if you have seen the 2014 film the man who saved the world, staring kevin costner, then you might have some sort of an idea of who petrov is, as that movie was based how he prevented a nuclear crisis between the us and the ussr, as well as averting the potential for world war iii, back in the 1980s by essentially doing nothing at all. that could be a part of the reason petrov never considered himself a hero. at first when people started telling me that these tv reports had started calling me a hero, i was surprised. i never thought of myself as one   after all, i was literally just doing my job,  he once said in an interview later in life.the date was september 26, 1983 and petrov was on duty in a bunker near moscow, in charge of an early warning radar system. it wasn t long after midnight when petrov noticed a single missile on the screen, launched from the us and heading toward the soviet union. when i first saw the alert message, i got up from my chair. all my subordinates were confused, so i started shouting orders at them to avoid panic. i knew my decision would have a lot of consequences,  petrov recalled in a 2010 interview. the siren went off for a second time. giant blood-red letters appeared on our main screen, saying  start.  it said that four more missiles had been launched. this left the kremlin only 30 minutes from when the warheads were initially fired to decide whether retaliation with nuclear weapons of their own was necessary and petrov just 15 minutes to determine if the threat was indeed real. my cozy armchair felt like a red-hot frying pan and my legs went limp. i felt like i couldn t even stand up. that s how nervous i was when i was taking this decision. fortunately for all of mankind, petrov recalled from his training that, if the us were to attack, they would do so on an all-out offensive, as opposed to simply firing a couple of missiles here and there. petrov took this into account and declined to tell his superior officers, figuring that a system malfunction must be responsible for the alarm and it turned out he was right; the soviet satellites had actually picked up sunlight reflected from clouds and mistaken it for nuclear warheads, although petrov s decision to keep the information from his superiors was a severe infraction of soviet military rules.the incident was kept as a highly classified secret for years. even at the time of her death in 1997, petrov s own wife, raisa, wasn t aware of what he had done and it was only made public when colonel general yury votintsev, petrov s superintendent, decided in 1998 that his deed should be commended and told the story to bild, a german tabloid. german political activist karl schumacher was so affected by the article that he traveled to russia to find petrov and invited him back to germany in order to give his version  of how he had saved the world from nuclear war, something that had been a very real threat for decades.in 2006, the association of world citizens presented petrov with an award in the un headquarters in new york, which reads:  to the man who averted nuclear war.  in 2012, petrov was also honored with the german media prize, which has previously been awarded to nelson mandela, the dalai lama and kofi annan.stanislav petrov was 77 years old. watch the story of stanislav petrov s actions unfold here:",1
" the united states pulled out of a regional hearing held on tuesday to discuss the possible effects on human rights from executive orders signed by u.s. president donald trump targeting immigrants and refugees, organizers said. the hearing by the inter american commission on human rights (iachr), created by the 35 nation organization of american states (oas) to protect human rights in the americas, follows concerns over the impact of three executive orders signed by trump, including plans to build a wall on the border with mexico. the u.s. government has appealed a federal judge’s halt on trump’s ban on refugees and travelers from six predominantly muslim countries. trump said the ban was needed to protect the country from islamist militants but immigration advocates said it discriminated against muslims. maria isabel rivero, a spokeswoman for the iachr, said the united states advised the commission on monday it would not attend the panel, which includes representatives from a number of regional human rights and immigration groups. “if the member state doesn’t want to be represented there is nothing we can do about it but the hearing goes ahead anyway,” rivero said. state department spokesman mark toner said government lawyers felt it would not have been appropriate to discuss the executive orders while some are under review by u.s. courts. “we did inform the iachr of our inability to attend these particular hearings because of ongoing litigation around some of these executive orders,” toner told a conference call with reporters. “we did not feel we could address concerns in an open hearing,” he added. marselha goncalves margerin, advocacy director at amnesty international, said the lack of u.s. representation at the panel showed “ a total disregard of its commitment to human rights.” she said while it was not unprecedented that member states that are the focus of a hearing do not attend, the panel was an opportunity for the united states to explain the executive orders.  “the u.s. has attended these hearings for the last eight years,” said goncalves margerin. “by failing to be present at this hearing, the u.s. joins cuba and venezuela in turning its back on people in the americas who seek justice for human rights abuses.” ",0
" prospects dimmed on monday for the u.s. house of representatives to vote this week on republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before congress goes on a seven week summer break.  republicans including house speaker paul ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the june 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida. congress begins a summer recess on friday. but with the house floor schedule filling with other bills, republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before september, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   representative jim jordan of ohio, who heads the conservative house freedom caucus, said, “i do not anticipate that bill.” the measure, backed by the national rifle association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. but ryan has been unable to win support from conservative republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. but the measure did not come up at a monday meeting with republican leaders to discuss the week’s agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   the stalemate leaves hanging democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25 hour sit in by house democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. “a vote is going to be stalled” until congress returns from its long summer break, one republican aide said. lawmakers initially believed congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of americans in favor of greater restrictions.

" iranian president hassan rouhani demanded on sunday that barack obama block an extension of sanctions passed by the u.s. congress, saying tehran would otherwise “firmly respond”. in a speech to parliament, rouhani denounced legislation passed by the u.s. congress to extend the iran sanctions act (isa) for 10 years as a violation of tehran’s nuclear deal with six major powers. the deal curbs tehran’s nuclear program in return for the lifting of international financial sanctions. “america’s president is obliged to exercise his authority by preventing its approval and particularly its implementation ... and if this gross violation is carried out we will firmly respond,” rouhani said in the speech, carried live by state television. president obama is expected to sign the legislation into law, the white house said on friday. the u.s. congress move was a blow to rouhani, a pragmatist who engineered the diplomatic opening to the west that led to the nuclear deal. u.s. officials have said the isa renewal would not infringe the nuclear agreement. u.s. lawmakers have also said the isa extension would make it easier for sanctions to be quickly reimposed if iran contravened the nuclear deal. on sunday, 264 lawmakers in iran’s 290 seat parliament issued a statement calling on the government to implement counter measures, including relaunching nuclear enrichment halted under the atomic deal, the official news agency irna reported.  the diplomatic thaw between washington and tehran over the past two years looks in jeopardy with u.s. president elect donald trump taking office next month. he said during his election campaign that he would scrap the nuclear agreement. last month, iran’s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei warned that the extension would be viewed in tehran as a breach of the nuclear accord and threatened retaliation. khamenei and his hardline loyalists have criticized the deal and blamed rouhani for his government’s failure to deliver swift improvements in living standards since sanctions were lifted in january.

" the special counsel examining alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election removed a top fbi investigator from his team for exchanging text messages with a colleague that expressed anti trump views, two u.s. newspapers reported on saturday. the new york times and the washington post identified the investigator as fbi agent peter strzok, the deputy head of fbi counter intelligence. he was reassigned last summer to the fbi’s human resources department after the justice department’s inspector general began looking into the text messages, the papers said, quoting several unidentified people familiar with the matter. a source familiar with the matter confirmed the reports strzok was transferred to the human resources department over the politically charged text messages. strzok played a key role in the fbi investigation into former secretary of state hillary clinton’s use of a private email server, the papers said.  during that probe and the 2016 presidential election, strzok and an fbi colleague exchanged texts that disparaged then republican candidate donald trump and favored clinton, his democratic rival, the washington post said. the newspapers did not disclose details of the text messages. reuters was unable to reach strzok for comment. the new york times said that a lawyer for strzok declined to comment, while the washington post said it repeatedly sought comment from strzok, but received no response.  mueller’s office confirmed strzok’s removal, but did not elaborate on the cause. “immediately upon learning of the allegations, the special counsel’s office removed peter strzok from the investigation,” spokesman peter carr said. in apparent reference to the case, the justice department inspector general’s office said in a statement on saturday that it was “reviewing allegations involving communications between certain individuals.” the matter came up during a review that the justice department launched into the fbi’s decision to announce an inquiry into clinton’s emails shortly before the november presidential election. the statement provided no further details and it did not mention any individuals by name. the department of justice did not respond to a request for further comment. the fbi was not immediately available for comment.  according to the newspapers, federal law enforcement officials became concerned that trump and his supporters could use the exposure of the text messages to attack the credibility of mueller’s investigation. mueller, a former fbi director, is looking into possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russia, which ran an influence operation aimed at swinging the vote to trump over clinton, according to three u.s. intelligence agencies. trump has criticized the fbi’s handling of the clinton email investigation, initially citing it as his reason for firing former fbi director james comey on may 9. some lawmakers have called for mueller to resign.

" venezuelan president nicolas maduro has invited bondholders to unspecified  negotiations  over the country s foreign debt in coming days, in response to recent u.s. financial sanctions.  with venezuela deep in recession and its currency reserves at their lowest in more than two decades, the maduro government and state oil company pdvsa have to pay about $4 billion in debt and interest during the rest of 2017.      all bondholders are invited to various rounds of negotiations over the next few weeks,  the president said in a speech late on thursday to the new constituent assembly. he reiterated venezuela would keep honoring debt, but said he wanted to talk with bondholders affected by sanctions recently imposed by u.s. president donald trump.  maduro said vice president tareck el aissami, already under u.s. financial sanctions over drug trafficking allegations, and finance minister ramon lobo would coordinate talks and some  bilateral conversations  with bondholders had already begun. in the same speech, maduro said venezuela would seek to  free  itself of the u.s. dollar and  implement a new system of international payments  using currencies such as the yuan, yen, rupee, euro and ruble. the president did not, however, specify whether paying in a different currency was an option his government wanted to discuss with bondholders. the washington based institute of international finance, which represents large banks and financial institutions, said it was advising a group of holders of venezuelan bonds.  this informal group will take note of the venezuelan announcements and discuss how to proceed,  iif executive managing director hung tran told reuters. the group was made up of bondholders from the united states and elsewhere, he said. tran said venezuela could not change the currency of bonds without agreement by all or a large majority of holders. last month, trump, who brands maduro a  dictator,  signed an executive order that prohibits americans from dealing in new debt issued by the venezuelan government or pdvsa. that could complicate any debt refinancing attempts. washington has also sanctioned pdvsa s finance boss simon zerpa, meaning u.s. businesses are barred from dealing with him, and even maduro himself in measures intended to punish the venezuelan government for alleged corruption and rights abuses.   i will be announcing venezuela s definitive response to the financial aggression we   and the international investors   have suffered from donald trump and (opposition leader) julio borges,  maduro added in the speech on thursday. borges, the head of the opposition led congress whose role has been overridden by the constituent assembly, has been spearheading an opposition campaign for foreign financial institutions to put the squeeze on venezuela s government.  venezuela will take a position to defend the judicial and financial security of the republic and its investors or holders of financial instruments,  maduro added. though maduro gave no further details of what his government wanted to discuss with bondholders or where talks would be held, he did say 74 percent were american or canadian.  three bondholders consulted by reuters said they had not received any formal approach to dialogue, though two said intermediaries for the government had been communicating with some investors informally.  we didn t receive an invitation or anything like that. even if we had we don t think we would take it too seriously,  said one portfolio manager at a large new york firm that owns venezuelan debt, asking not to be named.  in trading on friday, venezuelan government and pdvsa bonds were little changed in price. the opec nation of 30 million people is in the fourth year of a recession, with its population grappling with triple digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine.  critics say a long failing socialist economic system is to blame for venezuela s financial troubles, while the government blames an alleged  economic war  by domestic foes and washington.  international reserves stood at $9.873 billion on wednesday, compared with nearly $30 billion five years ago, central bank data shows. they are at their lowest level since 1995. most of the country s reserves are tied up in gold that cannot be used in financial transactions without going through a certification process in another country.  in another speech on friday, maduro said that venezuela would begin selling its oil, gas, gold and  all products  in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, but gave no further details of the intended changes in export transactions.

" a u.s. district judge again declined to ease bail conditions for president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his business associate richard gates on monday, saying they still needed to provide more financial information. judge amy berman jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that manafort had offered as security to get the court to lift house arrest and allow him to stop wearing an electronic monitoring device. manafort and gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12 count indictment as part of special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into alleged russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with trump associates. they are charged with conspiring to launder money, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine’s former pro russian government. jackson said she was especially worried about life insurance policies manafort had offered as part of an effort to secure better bail conditions. the policies, valued at about $4.5 million are held in trust and in his wife’s name. but having a relative serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, jackson said, “is very problematic.” anyone serving in this capacity needs to provide details about their assets and liabilities, she said.     life insurance policies held in trust tend to have many restrictions and can also be subject to asset forfeiture in the case of a conviction, the judge said. “a lot of these details need to be nailed down” she said. prosecutors also say they are not yet satisfied they have enough details on how to value manafort’s properties, including a condo he has in trump tower, the president’s signature building in new york. manafort, a longtime republican operative, ran trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year. the kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election. trump has denied collusion between his associates and russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. the judge last week also denied requests from manafort and gates for an easing of their bail conditions. jackson did grant a request from gates to be allowed to leave his virginia home on tuesday to vote. on monday, the judge said she is not very likely to grant any requests for the freedom to travel internationally and is inclined to require the pair to stay in the washington area for work, unless such trips are cleared in advance. currently, manafort has promised to pay $10 million and gates $5 million if they fail to appear for future court appearances. manafort is seeking permission to travel to new york where he has clients, as well as fort lauderdale, florida, where his attorney kevin downing said he has a telecommunications business involving secure and “virtually indestructible” cell phones.  a spokesman for manafort could not immediately provide details on the business when asked by reuters on monday. the judge also held off on setting a future trial date, and ordered the parties to return for a status hearing on dec. 11.

" russia is testing president donald trump with a surge of violence in eastern ukraine and the u.s. president should give ukraine the lethal aid it needs to defend against the attacks, senator john mccain said in a letter to trump on thursday. renewed violence flared this week between moscow backed rebels and ukraine government forces that has caused the highest casualty rate since mid december and cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on both sides of the frontline. “that this surge of attacks began the day after he talked with you by phone is a clear indication that vladimir putin is moving quickly to test you as commander in chief. america’s response will have lasting consequences,” mccain said in a letter to trump released by his office. washington has supplied aid to ukraine including drones, radar, first aid kits, night vision and communications gear as part democratic president barack obama’s strategy of providing non lethal military assistance while focusing on sanctions and diplomacy to end the war. the election of trump, whose call for better relations with moscow, has alarmed kiev as the conflict has remained unresolved. lawmakers in washington expressed support for ukraine on thursday and called for restraint from moscow. mccain urged trump to use his authority under an existing  defense policy law to provide lethal assistance to ukraine. “vladimir putin’s violent campaign to destabilize and dismember the sovereign nation of ukraine will not stop unless and until he meets a strong and determined response,” mccain wrote. mccain also urged trump to expand current sanctions against russia that were put in place after its annexation of ukraine’s crimea region in 2014. democratic senator ben cardin, top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, said he would work with mccain and other senators to codify the existing sanctions into law. “it is incumbent upon the senate to clearly express its support for the sovereignty of ukrainian and solidarity with our close allies in europe,” he said. nancy pelosi, the top democrat in the house of representatives, also cautioned the trump administration on thursday against easing sanctions on moscow, saying such a move would be “staggeringly dangerous.” on wednesday, nato secretary general jens stoltenberg called on russia to use its “considerable influence” with separatist rebels to end the violence, which brought the festering conflict back into focus amid warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis in freezing winter temperatures.

" sri lanka is keen to reach agreement soon on a free trade deal with china, its foreign minister said on tuesday, describing beijing as a close friend and ally, despite strong local opposition to some major chinese invested schemes. in july, sri lanka signed a long delayed $1.1 billion deal to lease its southern hambantota port to china, ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament. the $1.5 billion port, close to the main shipping route from asia to europe and likely to play a key role in china s  belt and road  initiative, has been mired in controversy since a chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it. the pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger, as chinese control of the port, which included a plan for a 99 year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an adjacent industrial zone, provoked fears it could be used by chinese naval vessels. sri lanka foreign minister tilak marapana told a reception in beijing to mark the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties that the two countries  friendship went back centuries.  sri lanka is very keen to reach an early conclusion to the free trade agreement with china in the near future that would expand more trade avenues for both countries,  marapana said.  china has been a reliable and important partner in our drive towards economic development and sri lanka is appreciative of the country s commitment and assistance,  he added, without mentioning any specific projects. as one of the first countries to help in sri lanka s post war reconstruction after the 2009 end of its 26 year civil war, china s ties with sri lanka have unnerved india, traditionally the island nation s most important partner.     by 2014, chinese navy submarines were also docking in colombo, raising alarm in new delhi and prompting a push by the administration of prime minister narendra modi to claw back influence in the region.  sri lanka is deeply appreciative of china for being a true and trusted friend and ally during our times of need,  marapana said.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton defended her paid speeches to wall street, saying in an interview that aired on friday that they would not soften her campaign pledges for tougher regulation.  the former u.s. senator from new york and secretary of state is under pressure from rival candidate bernie sanders, who has made her wall street ties a top campaign issue and called for her to release transcripts of her remarks. clinton was reportedly paid millions in appearance fees after leaving the state department. asked whether she could assure u.s. voters that the speeches would not undermine her calls to rein in the financial industry, clinton told msnbc: “absolutely.” “i’m on the public record. i told them what i’m going to do. i said i’m going to go after big banks that pose a systemic risk. i want you to hold me accountable for that because i will do that exactly,” she told the network’s “morning joe” program.  the new york times, in an editorial late on thursday, urged clinton to release the transcripts, saying “voters have every right to know what mrs. clinton told these groups.” according to the paper, clinton earned $11 million in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 from 51 speeches to banks and other groups and industries. clinton has said she will release copies of her remarks when other presidential candidates do the same.  on friday, she said president barack obama’s fundraising from wall street had not prevented him from enacting dodd frank financial services reforms after the 2007 2009 financial crisis.  clinton reiterated her position that regulations must go farther, saying, “dodd frank is great. it gives us a foundation. it doesn’t go far enough. we need to look at these other entities that pose systemic risks, as well.” as far as so called unwinding of banks that pose a risk, she added: “we’re going to do in an orderly way so there will not be any surprises.”  sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, is vying with clinton for the democratic nomination in the november presidential election. “i do not receive many millions of dollars from wall street or the pharmaceutical industry or other powerful, wealthy interests in this country, and have not given speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars to wall street,” sanders told a chicago rally on thursday, the washington post reported. the next democratic nominating contest is on saturday in south carolina.

" support from business leaders for peru s president pedro pablo kuczynski has plummeted, a survey showed, as he spars with an opposition controlled congress and struggles to revive economic growth. the survey by ipsos peru, taken at a business forum in paracas to the south of lima last week and released late on friday, showed participants  approval for kuczynski fell to 37 percent from 89 percent a year earlier at a similar event. kuczynski took office in july 2016 promising to modernize peru and strengthen its economy with solid backing from lima s business elite after a tight runoff election against right wing populist keiko fujimori. but the 79 year old former investment banker s first year in power was hampered by congress, which is dominated by fujimori s popular force party and voted to oust his cabinet in september.  meanwhile economic growth in what was once one of latin america s fastest growing economies slowed after heavy flooding and a corruption scandal involving brazilian builder odebrecht stalled investment in public works projects.  the economy and politics cannot continue on separate lines, their progress is interdependent and deficiencies in politics and institutions can block the path of our development,  the president of the business forum, drago kisic, told reporters. peru s central bank president julio velarde also warned during the event that the clashes between the government and congress could hinder growth in the future, saying the finance ministry had lost influence over the legislature.  it is absolutely necessary in the long term that there be a better consensus among political forces in terms of agreeing on the essential elements to underpin growth,  he said.  finance minister claudia cooper said on friday peru s economy could grow more than 4 percent in 2018, up from 2.8 percent expected in 2017, if private investment in the metals exporting nation recovered. the ipsos survey showed that among hundreds attending peru s best known business forum, disapproval with kuczynski had risen to 63 percent from 11 percent a year earlier. closing the conference on friday, kuczynski defended his government and called on attendees and congress to unite in a fight against populism.  i want to ask you to speak out more clearly about the challenges that we are facing politically, this is a determined government, not a confrontational one,  he said.

" an egyptian activist who is under criminal investigation for his human rights work on tuesday dedicated an international rights award to the thousands of egyptians he said had been tortured or imprisoned since veteran ruler hosni mubarak was overthrown. mohamed zaree, 37, the egypt office director of the cairo institute for human rights studies, won the martin ennals award, a prize given each year by a jury of 10 global rights groups. he is banned from traveling abroad so could not collect the award in person in geneva, but spoke to the audience on tuesday by video conference.  i do not view this honor as recognition of my work alone,  zaree said.  instead, this award belongs to the tens of thousands of egyptian citizens who have been tortured, imprisoned, disappeared or killed over the last six years for nothing more than standing up to corruption and tyranny through peaceful means.   egyptian rights activists accuse president abdel fattah al sisi of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 arab spring uprising that ended mubarak s 30 year rule. last year authorities reopened an investigation into non governmental organizations that document abuses, which the government accuses of receiving foreign funding to spread chaos since seizing power in mid 2013 from the muslim brotherhood, sisi has presided over a crackdown on his islamist opponents that has seen hundreds killed and many thousands jailed.  but the dragnet has since widened to include secular and liberal activists at the forefront of the 2011 uprising. egypt says the measures are necessary for national security and that hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed.     zaree s seat was empty in the audience but his wife, shymaa abd el aziz, and two school age daughters received the award presented by kate gilmore, united nations deputy high commissioner for human rights, on his behalf. he faces charges that could carry a life in prison sentence for  receiving funds from foreign entities to harm national security  and has been banned from travel since may 2016. his wife tearfully said the last time he was interrogated they lied to their daughters and said he was going somewhere for work. she said that him winning the award gave them the courage to tell them the truth if he was arrested.  within the context of the renewed crackdown on egyptian human rights organizations, he has become a leading figure in egypt s human rights movement,  the awards jury said.   government pressure forced the cairo institute for human rights studies to relocate its headquarters to tunisia in 2014. the runners up for the martin ennals award were karla avelar, who founded el salvador s first organization of transgender women, and freethe5kh, five cambodian human rights activists who were recently released. the award s first recipient in 1994 was chinese dissident harry wu.

" a bipartisan group of senators will soon offer a proposal for more funding to fight a zika outbreak spreading rapidly through the americas, senate appropriations committee chairman thad cochran said on thursday. democrats and obama administration officials have urged the republican controlled congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat zika, a virus borne by mosquitoes that can cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect. but many republicans have said they need more information from the administration before approving the measure.  in a temporary fix, the white house said earlier this month it would reprogram $589 million of allocated funds, but said this would be insufficient to deal with the threat. cochran, speaking at an appropriations committee meeting, did not say how much funding would be in the proposal. the republican said it would supplement the white house reallocation. “we recognize that there is an urgency associated with the threat,” cochran said. “this proposal will provide new resources ... it is my expectation that this proposal will be offered to an appropriations measure on the senate floor in the near future.” senator barbara mikulski, the senior democrat on the panel, said lawmakers must act before july 1. “we are in a race against the clock, we are in a race with the mosquitoes and right now i would say that the mosquitoes are winning.” zika was first detected in brazil last year and linked to a spike in the birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can hamper development, as well as the rare autoimmune disorder guillain barre syndrome in adults. u.s. health officials say local outbreaks are possible in the continental united states once the weather warms, particularly in southern states such as florida. but mosquitoes that carry the virus could spread further north. cochran said it had been difficult to obtain the information necessary to thoroughly evaluate the obama administration’s zika funding request, a complaint also raised by republicans in the house of representatives.  several senators, including democrat patty murray and republican roy blunt, are working on the proposal, cochran said. blunt told the panel that he and murray were largely in agreement and he looked forward to working on the matter over the next few days. “i believe we are closing in on a number that is the right number,” he said, without elaborating.

" u.s. president donald trump criticized the united nations for bloated bureaucracy and mismanagement on his first visit on monday to u.n. headquarters, calling for  truly bold reforms  so it could be a greater force for world peace. ahead of his maiden speech to the annual u.n. general assembly on tuesday, trump hosted a short event to boost support for changes to the united nations.  in recent years the united nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, while the united nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 percent and its staff has more than doubled since 2000,  trump said.  the united nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistleblowers and focus on results rather than on process,  trump said.   i am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms the united nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just and greater force for peace and harmony in the world,  trump said in his first remarks at the u.n. in new york since his inauguration as president in january. in a building where long statements are commonplace, trump spoke for just four minutes.  some 128 countries were invited to attend monday s reform meeting after signing on to a u.s. drafted 10 point political declaration backing efforts by u.n. secretary general antonio guterres  to initiate effective, meaningful reform.  u.n. security council veto powers russia and china did not sign the declaration.  businessman trump, who complained during his 2016 election campaign about the united states paying a disproportionate amount of money to the united nations, made the point again on monday.  we must ensure that no one and no member state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden and that s militarily or financially.   the united states is the biggest u.n. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. the contributions are agreed on by the 193 member general assembly. guterres, who also took office in january, told the meeting:  to serve the people we support and the people who support us, we must be nimble and effective, flexible and efficient.  he agreed that u.n bureaucracy was a problem that kept him up at night.      our shared objective is a 21st century u.n. focused more on people and less on process,  guterres said.  value for money while advancing shared values   that is our common goal.  trump also said that all peacekeeping missions should  have clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.  the united states is reviewing each of the u.n. peacekeeping missions as annual mandates come up for security council renewal in a bid to cut costs. the united states is a veto wielding council member, along with britain, france, russia and china. on sunday night, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson met with u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi.  when asked if the u.n. refugee agency could perform its current missions if the united states cut its voluntary contributions to the budget, according to a pool report grandi answered:  i would say no.   u.s. aid is vital to what we do to support refugees around the world and to find solutions to their situations,  grandi said.

" three dozen opponents of venezuela s socialist government were released from prison and reunited with their families on sunday as part of a wider christmas release, a local rights group said. lambasted by critics at home and abroad for holding around 270 activists in prison, president nicolas maduro s administration said on saturday it was freeing 80 of them with alternative sentences like community service.  thirteen were paraded in front of tv cameras at a meeting with a senior official, delcy rodriguez. she harangued them for violence and subversion, but also wished them a happy christmas.  alfredo romero, whose penal forum group tracks the detention of activists and protesters, said 36  political prisoners  had been freed by sunday morning. but he criticized the government for not giving a blanket amnesty.   they should release not just some but all of them, and not imprison any more,  he said. the best known among the released prisoners were former provincial mayor alfredo ramos, opposition electoral adviser roberto picon and a dozen policemen who worked for the opposition run chacao district of caracas.   i m happy to be free. i m with my family,  ramos was quoted as saying in local media.   it was a tough ordeal, very difficult. it was an arbitrary detention, unjust. i didn t commit any crime.  maduro, the 55 year old successor to hugo chavez, refutes the term  political prisoners , saying all of the jailed activists were there on legitimate charges of plotting to overthrow his government and promoting violence.  some 170 people died during two rounds of anti maduro street protests in 2014 and earlier this year.   opponents say they are fighting for freedom against a  dictatorship  that has destroyed the opec nation s economy and democracy. maduro accuses them of being part of a global right wing plot to topple him in a coup. u.s. lawmaker ileana ros lehtinen, a fierce critic of both venezuela and cuba s communist government, called the pre christmas releases in venezuela a hypocritical gesture.  maduro in venezuela cynically  releases  80 political prisoners who were actually innocent, parades and humiliates several on state tv ... and expects thanks for christmas  mercy ,  tweeted the republican u.s. representative from florida.  what a cruel farce.  nevertheless, the releases could inject life into stuttering mediation talks between venezuela s government and opposition due to resume in the dominican republic in early january. the releases  concretely demonstrate the revolution and president nicolas maduro s firm desire for dialogue,  foreign minister jorge arreaza said.  let s hope the opposition knows how to interpret this and isolate its violent factors.  venezuela s best known detained politician is leopoldo lopez, who remains under house arrest in caracas, accused of spearheading violence in 2014.  though they have turned his house into a jail, i know his mind is strong and he will keep fighting tirelessly for a better venezuela,  said his mother antonieta lopez, lamenting he was spending a fourth christmas detained.

" britain s oxford university said one of its professors, the prominent swiss muslim intellectual tariq ramadan, had taken a leave of absence after two women filed complaints against him in france alleging rape.  the university has consistently acknowledged the gravity of the allegations against professor ramadan, while emphasising the importance of fairness and the principles of justice and due process,  oxford university said in a statement.  an agreed leave of absence implies no presumption or acceptance of guilt and allows professor ramadan to address the extremely serious allegations made against him, all of which he categorically denies,  it added.  the geneva born academic, the grandson of hasan al banna, an islamist thinker and activist who founded the muslim brotherhood, has denied allegations made by the two women, including author henda ayari, who said he raped her at a muslim convention in 2012.  the paris prosecutor last month opened a preliminary probe over the accusations following ayari s complaint. ramadan filed a complaint for slander against her.  on tuesday ramadan published on his facebook page, in french, the same statement as oxford university, adding that he welcomed the university s handling of the situation.  separately, prosecutors on monday opened an investigation into death threats on twitter against satirical weekly charlie hebdo for a front page cover it published over the rape accusations targetting ramadan. twelve people were killed at the magazine s headquarters in january 2015, the first of a wave of militant attacks that has left more than 240 dead over the past two and a half years.

" the former head of china s powerful internet regulator is under investigation for suspected corruption, the ruling communist party said, the latest senior official to be caught up in a sweeping campaign against graft. lu wei was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the party s corruption busting central commission for discipline inspection (ccdi) said in a brief statement late on tuesday, using a euphemism for graft. reuters was unable to reach lu or a representative to seek comment. at the height of his influence, lu, a colorful and often brash official by chinese standards, was seen as emblematic of china s increasingly pervasive internet controls.  organizers of china s first world internet conference in 2014, set up under lu to promote beijing s vision of internet governance, irked foreign tech firms by seeking their agreement on a last minute declaration on  internet sovereignty .  tech industry representatives ultimately declined to sign the pledge, and rights groups condemned the declaration as an attempt to undermine internet freedom. in 2015, he told reporters,  indeed, we do not welcome those that make money off china, occupy china s market, even as they slander china s people. these kinds of websites i definitely will not allow in my house.  but courting china s powerful internet regulator, the cyberspace administration of china, was a key task for companies hoping to stay in his good graces or gain access to the huge internet market. when lu visited facebook inc s u.s. campus in 2014, mark zuckerberg, the founder of the social networking site that has long been blocked in china, greeted lu in mandarin, according to a chinese government website. but lu s downfall, foreshadowed by his june 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have tightened further under successor xu lin. in a separate statement on its website on wednesday, the ccdi emphasized the significance of lu being the first  tiger , or senior official, to be brought to heel for corruption since the key 19th communist party congress held last month. it said that under lu, the cyberspace administration did not carry out president xi jinping s instructions in a timely or resolute fashion.  the improper use of power occurred on occasion, and the safeguarding of political security was not strong enough,  it said, without elaborating on any of lu s specific wrongdoings.       lu worked his way up though china s official xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. he became a deputy propaganda minister after being replaced at the internet regulator.  the government has blocked sites it deems could challenge communist party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as facebook and google s main search engine and gmail service. xi has waged war against deep rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials.

" the u.s. navy s top officer on tuesday said that vessels from eastern pacific could be brought forward to reinforce u.s. naval power in asia as washington contends with increased threats in the region and accidents that have weakened its maritime force.  we will continue to assure that we meet all of our missions here in the asia pacific area. it could be something coming forward from third fleet or something like that to meet those requirements,  chief of u.s. naval operations admiral john richardson said at a briefing aboard the uss ronald reagan carrier in japan. he declined to say when or how many ships could be transferred. the growing threat posed by north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapon advances coupled with operations to counter china s increasing military might in the south china sea and other parts of asia is putting an increased burden on the u.s. seventh fleet.  that added pressure on crews has been blamed for contributing to a series of accidents involving naval vessels this year including collisions by two destroyers with merchant ships that killed 17 u.s. sailors. in august the uss john s.mccain guided missile destroyer was struck by a merchant ship near singapore, while its sister ship, the fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of japan in june after colliding with a philippine container ship.  richardson spoke after u.s. president donald trump unveiled a new national security strategy based on his  america first  vision that singled out china and russia as  revisionist powers.  for its part, china is attempting to revise the global status quo by its aggression in the south china sea, a u.s. official said. beijing is building military bases there on manmade islands in waters claimed by other nations.   one can only draw certain conclusion about what are the intentions of the chinese with respect to those islands. we will respond as we have always done, which is that we are going to continue to be present down there,  richardson said.  for now, he said, north korea was the  most urgent  task for the u.s. navy in asia as it became  more and more capable  with every new missile test. the latest ballistic missile tested on nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 kilometers (2485.48 miles), giving it enough range, pyongyang claims, to hit major u.s. cities including washington d.c.  richardson said his task in 2018 is to build a navy  more lethal  and  dangerous  to potential u.s. foes.   there is a near unanimous consensus that we need more naval power than we have now,  he said.

" british police arrested four men on tuesday, including some serving soldiers, on suspicion of belonging to a banned far right group and planning terrorist acts.  the men, aged 22 to 32, were detained on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism and of being members of the national action group. the neo nazi organization became the first far right group to be outlawed in britain last year after the murder of member of parliament jo cox, whose killing the group had praised. the four arrests were made by counter terrorism officers in the cities of birmingham, ipswich and northampton and in powys, wales.   the arrests were pre planned and intelligence led; there was no threat to the public s safety,  west midlands police said. the ministry of defence (mod) said a number of serving members of the army had been arrested.  these arrests are the consequence of a home office police force led operation supported by the army,  an mod spokeswoman said.  this is now the subject of a civilian police investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further.   britain is on its second highest threat level,  severe , meaning an attack is highly likely. suspected islamists have killed 35 people this year in london and manchester, and a man died in june after a van was driven into worshippers near a london mosque. last month, a senior police chief said the number of referrals to the authorities about suspected right wing extremists had doubled since the murder of cox, who was killed in june last year by a loner obsessed with nazis and white supremacist ideology.

" former british prime minister edward heath would have been questioned about claims he sexually abused boys if he were alive today, police said on thursday after a two year investigation into the allegations. supporters of heath, who never married, have said the investigation was an expensive, flawed witch hunt.  heath, who was prime minister from 1970 to 1974 and died 12 years ago, would have been interviewed under caution over seven allegations including raping an 11 year old boy and indecently assaulting men and other boys, one aged 10. the alleged incidents occurred from 1956 to 1992 while he was a member of parliament but not prime minister, said wiltshire police, the force in western england which headed the national investigation named operation conifer.  i am satisfied there were compelling and obvious reasons to investigate allegations made against sir edward heath,  wiltshire chief constable mike veale told reporters, adding the report did not suggest or conclude guilt.  the allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people. it would be an indefensible dereliction of my public duty as a chief constable not to have investigated such serious allegations against a former prime minister, even though he is deceased.  in total, 40 individuals came forward with accusations against heath. of these, evidence undermining the claims were found in 19 cases and three accusers later concluded they were mistaken in naming the ex prime minister. but heath would have been quizzed over seven accusations, although police refused to say whether there was other corroborating evidence. the first occurred in 1961 when heath, who then had the title  lord privy seal , is alleged to have raped and indecently assaulted a boy  during a paid sexual encounter in a private dwelling .  other claims also related to  paid encounters , including one when he was trade minister, as well as during chance meetings. paul mills, the officer who led the investigation, said no accusations had been made against heath while he was alive and there had been no missed opportunities by police.  heath became prime minister in 1970 and most notably negotiated britain s entry into the european economic community, which later became the european union. he was ousted from office in 1974 when he lost two elections after a miners  strike helped bring down the government. he then lost the conservative party leadership in 1975 to margaret thatcher, whom he never forgave and repeatedly criticized in what detractors described as  the longest sulk in history . he remained a lawmaker until 2001 and four years later  aged 89. an artillery officer in world war two, heath was very private and was widely regarded as an awkward, prickly man with little gift for small talk. he was passionate about music and sailing, owning five racing yachts named morning cloud, and once winning the sydney to hobart race.  heath s godson, artist lincoln seligman, said the 1.5 million pound ($2 million) police investigation had cast a stain on a man who could not defend himself.  if allegations are out there he might easily have been called in for questioning,  he told bbc radio.  so, yes, they had to question him, but that tells us nothing.  in a joint statement, robert armstrong, heath s former cabinet secretary, and david hunt, chairman of the sir edward heath charitable foundation, said there should be a judge led review of the evidence. they called the police report  highly unsatisfactory .  all those who knew sir edward heath or worked with him are, without exception, convinced that the allegations of child abuse will all be found to be groundless,  they said. britain has been jolted by a series of high profile child abuse scandals in recent years. the most notable involved the late tv and radio presenter jimmy savile. a five year public inquiry is now looking into whether powerful figures in politics, churches, or local government helped hide abuses.

" democrat hillary clinton will press republican donald trump to provide more specifics on his policies in their presidential debate on monday, two top clinton campaign aides said ahead of a face off that could set u.s. television audience records.     on the eve of the debate at hofstra university in suburban new york, aides to clinton have sought to cast trump, a new york businessman and former reality tv host, as lacking the temperament and experience to serve as president. trump’s aides for their part have sought to reinforce voter doubts about clinton’s trustworthiness. the debate, the first of three face to face matchups between the two candidates, will begin at 9 p.m. on monday (0100 gmt on tuesday). it comes as opinion polls show a tight race between clinton, a former secretary of state, and trump, six weeks before the nov. 8 election. “we’re going to have a lot of people really tuning into this election for the first time. they’re going to see these two candidates onstage,” clinton campaign manager robby mook said on sunday in an interview with abc’s “this week.” “i think they’re going to see that donald trump is unfit, unprepared, and over his head. i doubt he will have a command of the issues.” mook said clinton would challenge trump at the debate “to reveal what his plans are. you know, for example, he has not revealed any plan whatsoever to defeat isis (islamic state) militants.” trump has said he would work closely with nato allies to defeat islamic state and vowed to wage a “military, cyber and financial” war against the militant group. “donald trump’s been all about himself. but she’s got to tell people what she wants to do for them,” john podesta, chairman of clinton’s campaign, told nbc’s “meet the press” on sunday. trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway, in a separate “this week” interview on sunday, attacked clinton’s trustworthiness. “you know, if you’re running against a clinton, veracity is certainly always on the table,” she said. “hillary clinton’s casual relationship with the truth is well known to americans. i’m sure we’ll see it on full display tomorrow night.” the trump campaign put to rest on sunday the prospect that he might invite gennifer flowers, who had an affair with clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, to attend the debate. after dallas mavericks owner mark cuban, a clinton supporter and vociferous critic of trump, tweeted that he had a “front row” seat to watch the hofstra debate, trump raised the possibility in a tweet of inviting flowers to the debate. but mike pence, trump’s running mate, told “fox news sunday” that flowers would not attend the debate. “donald trump was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by hillary clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from what the american people are going to be focused on tomorrow night, which is on the issues, on the choice that we face,” pence said. supporters of both candidates sought to manage expectations before the debate. mook said the moderator of monday’s debate, nbc news anchor lester holt, should fact check candidates’ statements, although trump’s campaign said it should be up to american voters to gauge who they thought was telling the truth. to prepare for the debate, clinton has been holding mock debate sessions where longtime aide philippe reines plays the role of trump. trump aides said their candidate, who like clinton participated in numerous tv debates during their respective parties’ nominating races, was preparing for monday’s event but not doing mock debates where someone plays the role of clinton. trump’s advisers said the republican presidential nominee was going up against a highly seasoned politician. “he’s the outsider, he’s a person who has never run before, let alone be in a presidential debate, but he’s going to be ready,” said republican national committee chairman reince priebus. “and i think one of the things donald trump has going for him is he’s got very good instincts.” ",0

" some northern chinese cities failed to improve air quality by much last month, hitting the smog prone region s overall results in a drive against pollution, the government said as it warned provincial officials to comply with stringent steps to clear the skies.  some cities did not improve air quality by much or even experienced some volatility, and in a way, they have dragged down the regional air quality level,  ministry of environmental protection (mep) spokesperson, liu youbin, said at a regular briefing on thursday. he did not identify the underperforming cities, but the comment comes amid concerns about the country s ability to reduce pollution in winter as it battles to avoid a repeat of the near record levels of choking smog that enveloped key northern areas at the start of the year.  there is no jesting in war. for those local officials who do not enforce the measures of the campaign effectively and could not improve air quality in time, we will hold them accountable,  liu added. data earlier this month showed only four of 28 northern chinese cities met their air quality targets in october and air quality in 338 chinese cities worsened in october, with levels of hazardous breathable particles, known as pm 2.5, up 5.6 percent on the year to an average of 38 micrograms per cubic meter.      beijing is under huge pressure to meet politically crucial air quality targets and clear the skies of toxic smog that blankets the north of the country as homes turn up the heat which is powered by coal. liu said overall air quality in the northern cities was improving compared with september. average pm 2.5 levels in the region dropped 15.8 percent in october from the month before, he said.   it shows that our measures are working. as long as we are persistent, and diligently enforce existing measures, regional air quality will definitely improve,  he said.  under the six month campaign, 28 northern chinese cities were ordered to thin traffic and cut industrial output. thousands of pollution sources including steel mills, coal fired boilers, cement and ceramic plants, mines and building sites will be shut. these measures, part of beijing s years long time war on smog, have already roiled commodities market, fuelling worries that the tough inspections are hurting the already slowing economy.

" in a new legal development on the controversy over former secretary of state hillary clinton’s emails, an appeals court on tuesday reversed a lower court ruling and said two u.s. government agencies should have done more to recover the emails. the ruling from judge stephen williams, of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, revives one of a number of legal challenges involving clinton’s handling of government emails when she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. clinton, the 2016 democratic presidential nominee, used a private email server housed at her new york home to handle state department emails. she handed over 55,000 pages of emails to u.s. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 she said were personal and not work related. the email case shadowed clinton’s loss to republican donald trump in the nov. 8 presidential election. trump, who had repeatedly said during the bruising campaign that if elected he would prosecute clinton, said after the election he had no interest in pursuing investigations into clinton’s email use. while the state department and national archives took steps  to recover the emails from clinton’s tenure, they did not ask the u.s. attorney general to take enforcement action. two conservative groups filed lawsuits to force their hand. a district judge in january ruled the suits brought by  judicial watch and cause of action moot, saying state and the national archives made a “sustained effort” to recover and preserve clinton’s records. but williams said the two agencies should have done more, according to the ruling in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. since the agencies neither asked the attorney general for help nor showed such enforcement action could not uncover new emails, the case was not moot. “the department has not explained why shaking the tree harder   e.g., by following the statutory mandate to seek action by the attorney general   might not bear more still,” williams wrote. “absent a showing that the requested enforcement action could not shake loose a few more emails, the case is not moot.”  the state department does not comment on pending litigation, a spokesperson said. williams noted that clinton used two non governmental email accounts at state and continued using the blackberry account she had while a u.s. senator during her first weeks as the nation’s u.s. diplomat. she only switched to the email account hosted on her private server in march 2009, the ruling said. “because the complaints sought recovery of emails from all of the former secretary’s accounts, the fbi’s recovery of a server that hosted only one account does not moot the suits, the judge wrote.

" the u.s. senate on thursday narrowly confirmed south carolina congressman mick mulvaney to serve as white house budget director in a 51 49 vote that largely followed party lines. underscoring the rocky reception that president donald trump’s cabinet nominees have had on capitol hill, the vote came as republican senator john mccain opposed mulvaney along with 46 democrats and two independents. mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said on wednesday he was concerned about mulvaney’s opposition to defense spending.   an outspoken budget hawk who has been branded by democrats  as a threat to popular social programs including social security and medicare, mulvaney entered the house of representatives as a tea party candidate in 2011 and is a member of the conservative house freedom caucus. democrats have also criticized him for failing to pay more than $15,000 in taxes related to a household employee until after he was nominated. mulvaney was narrowly approved earlier this month by both the senate budget committee and the senate homeland security committee, where mccain provided a crucial ‘yes’ vote to move the nomination forward.

" cyril ramaphosa may have won the race to be leader of the african national congress, but he failed to decisively wrest control of south africa s ruling party from president jacob zuma. zuma s faction retains influence in the anc s incoming national executive committee (nec) and was felt in conference debates on divisive policies such as land expropriation and nationalization. ramaphosa s incomplete victory could stymie his chances of tackling entrenched corruption and implementing reforms to kickstart economic growth, tasks which he placed at the center of his campaign for the anc s top job. it also lessens his chances of ousting zuma from the state presidency before his second term ends in 2019. that could disappoint investors who have bet heavily that ramaphosa, a 65 year old former trade union leader and millionaire businessman, will be able to turn around africa s most industrialized economy. the rand currency has been volatile since ramaphosa s election, as investors continue to assess how much clout he wields.  because ramaphosa does not have a strong majority in the nec and because of the lingering presence of zuma loyalists, he will not be able to drive his own agenda,  said darias jonker, director for africa at eurasia group. zuma s decade in power has badly tarnished the anc s image at home and abroad as growth slowed to a near standstill. he has survived several votes of no confidence, and analysts say he has cemented his control over the anc by using political patronage. the anc s new nec, announced in the early hours of thursday, is split roughly 50 50 between the ramaphosa and zuma factions. the party s  top six  most powerful officials, announced on monday, are also split down the middle. zuma said on thursday that  there was no winner or loser in the election of leaders  at the anc conference. were ramaphosa to try to force zuma from office, he would need to secure the support of the nec, which includes his main rival in the anc race, former cabinet minister nkosazana dlamini zuma, zuma s ex wife and preferred successor. others on the nec include prominent zuma lieutenants finance minister malusi gigaba and energy minister david mahlobo, who would defend the 75 year old leader to the bitter end. the two most controversial policy resolutions adopted at the anc conference on wednesday called for land expropriation without compensation and nationalization of the central bank. both those policies were most vociferously backed by dlamini zuma. the expropriation of land from white farmers in neighboring zimbabwe had a devastating impact on food production and any mention of nationalization in south africa is enough to spook investors, since left wing elements of the anc have also called for mines and banks to be state owned. a senior anc source told reuters the ramaphosa camp would try to ensure that the shift to full state ownership of the reserve bank would go no further than the resolution adopted at the conference.  the reserve bank said that changing its ownership structure could raise the level of uncertainty in the economy and would be costly. land expropriation without compensation is also unlikely to become the norm soon, but the fact that the anc called for the constitution to be amended as a step in that direction could dent already weak investor confidence.  this kind of rhetoric will now have to inform ramaphosa s speeches and perpetuate concerns over property rights at a time when the economy needs exactly the opposite signals,  said anne fruhauf, an analyst at consultancy teneo. land is especially emotive in south africa, where the anc is under pressure to address gaping racial inequality more than two decades after the end of white minority rule. the opposition democratic alliance on thursday criticized the anc s call for land expropriation, saying it failed to address the broader issues of property rights for poor south africans and government mismanagement of existing land programs. the debate over land was so heated among anc members on wednesday that a delegate said a fight broke out, and a party official said it nearly caused the conference to collapse. jonker at eurasia group said anc policies were always more populist and left leaning than what was eventually implemented by government.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday said he plans to nominate liberty university school of law professor caren harp to oversee the justice department’s office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. if ultimately confirmed by the u.s. senate, harp would oversee the justice department office that trains and works with state and local communities to develop effective juvenile justice programs and prevent delinquency. harp previously was director of the national juvenile justice prosecution center at the american prosecutors research institute.  according to harp’s linkedin page, she is in her sixth year as a professor at liberty, which is located in lynchburg, virginia. the law school’s website says its program is “taught from a christian worldview” and says it offers a “uniquely tailored legal program taught with sound biblical principles.” harp, who holds a law degree from the university of arkansas fayetteville, has also worked as both a prosecutor and a public defender, including as chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in new york city, family court division, and as a trial attorney for the arkansas public defender commission.  in an article published in may, harp raises questions about the role of adolescent neuroscience in the courtroom and writes that the best way to tackle juvenile justice is by teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community based diversion programs to prevent them from re offending.      “misplaced reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence to remove from youth and young adults the consequences of their criminal behavior invites pushback from those who favor a retributive system, and it may create some unintended and unwanted consequences for youth and young adults,” she writes. it is unclear when the senate may consider harp’s nomination. there are a handful of key nominees who have been waiting months now for their confirmation votes. nominees to head the criminal, civil and national security divisions, for instance, are still pending.

" a smiling donald trump offered european union chiefs assurances on security in brussels on thursday but eu officials did not conceal lingering differences with the u.s. president over russia, trade and climate change. “the leaders discussed ... shared challenges in fighting global terrorism,” the white house said in a statement.  “they agreed on the need to work together to deepen our security cooperation in fighting isis (islamic state), combating radicalisation and responding to other common threats.” in talks before a summit of nato leaders at the atlantic military alliance’s headquarters across town, an eu source said trump had also voiced fears that brexit could cost u.s. jobs — a possible sign of second thoughts on support for the british vote to leave which stunned the bloc.  and trump also agreed to setting up a joint eu u.s. “action plan” on trade, in an indication the new occupant of the white house is not as set on shunning free trade deals and promoting protectionism as some in europe had feared he might. the white house said “the united states and the european union should deepen our strong economic relationship” and spoke of a need to protect u.s. and eu industries from “unfair competition” — a shared concern coming, notably, from china. nonetheless, european council president donald tusk indicated, there was less than a meeting of minds on trade and other issues, despite the cordiality of trump’s welcome. “we agreed on many areas, first and foremost on counter terrorism,” tusk said after he and eu chief executive jean claude juncker met trump for over an hour.  “but some issues remain open, like climate and trade.” european leaders have been urging trump not to abandon the u.s. commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions made when his predecessor barack obama signed up to the u.n. paris accord. tusk also said he did not feel he and trump were on exactly the same page in terms of dealing with russian president vladimir putin, although they agreed on efforts to end conflict in ukraine which the west blames on moscow and which has resulted in both eu and u.s. economic sanctions on russia. a spokeswoman for juncker, the president of the european commission which had been negotiating an ambitious free trade deal with washington known as ttip before trump’s upset election victory, said the two sides would work to increase trade. “intensifying trade cooperation ... is a win win situation for both sides,” the eu spokeswoman said. “it was agreed to start work on a joint action plan on trade.” juncker declined comment on whether talks in the coming weeks might revive ttip. trump has made clear his dislike of multilateral trade agreements, pulling out of the tpp agreement with asian states. however, european leaders, including german chancellor angela merkel, have suggested he is warming to trade talks with the eu, which unifies trade rules for all 28 states. trump irritated eu leaders during his election campaign last year by hailing brexit and suggesting other countries might follow britain out of the 28 nation bloc. eurosceptic leaders said he would offer britain a free trade deal once it left. however, eu officials believe trump has come to appreciate more since taking office the value of european integration to u.s. interests. u.s. businesses have taken advantage of its single market to reduce the costs of exporting to europe. an eu source said trump had told tusk and juncker he was now worried that americans may lose jobs as a result of britain leaving the eu in 2019: he “expressed concern that jobs in the u.s. would be lost because of brexit”, the source said. eu officials said the meeting had been constructive and friendly. tusk and juncker joked with trump about the eu having “two presidents” and being “too complicated”. the u.s. leader appeared to mix the two of them up during remarks in january, deepening concerns in brussels that the reality tv star in the white house failed to take the european union seriously. trump waxed lyrical about his first foreign trip, which has offered distraction to ethics questions at home, notably over alleged campaign ties to russia. pope francis is “terrific”, trump told tusk and juncker, and his welcome in saudi arabia was “beyond anything anyone’s ever seen”. tusk, a communist era dissident who once listed trump among risks to the world order alongside russia, china and islamist violence, said he had tried to impress on the billionaire u.s. president a need for transatlantic cooperation to promote “values” like human rights and not just selfish “interests”. the white house said the meeting had “reaffirmed the strong bond between the united states and europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.” ",0
" oklahoma’s legislature has passed a bill aimed at reducing the state’s bulging population of feral hogs, blamed for spreading disease and wiping out crops, that would let people kill them without a hunting license. a study by an agricultural research organization found that the animals are running wild in all of oklahoma’s 77 counties and could number as high as 1.6 million, which would be one of the highest feral hog populations of any state. the measure, passed on thursday by the republican led legislature, would permit hunters to kill hogs without a hunting permit on their property or on someone else’s property with the landowner’s permission. it also would allow use of night vision equipment to hunt them. republican governor mary fallin’s office has not said whether she will sign it into law. “this legislation gives oklahomans more options to combat the rapidly growing feral hog population,” said republican state representative sean robert, a bill co sponsor. the most effective method of eradicating the wild hogs currently is aerial shooting from helicopters, state officials said. “feral hogs wreak havoc on oklahoma’s farms, ranches and ecosystems, and cost farmers, ranchers and landowners,” said tom buchanan, president of the oklahoma farm bureau, an agricultural industry group that supports the legislation. bill opponents said it could prompt some people to bring even more feral hogs into oklahoma to be shot by hunters. the u.s. department of agriculture’s animal and plant health inspection service said damage caused by feral swine across the united states could top $2 billion. “if you are a farmer, they can clean out your crops overnight,” dale nolte, the inspection service’s program manager, said in an interview. “we have farmers tell us they have given up on planting high dollar crops because of the feral hog problem.” texas, oklahoma and california have the highest numbers of feral swine in the country, nolte said. the inspection service has operations to remove them in 38 states, nolte added. “the problem is that feral hogs are so prolific that we have to trap 70 percent of the pig population every year just to maintain the population level we have right now,” said kevin grant, oklahoma wildlife services state director for the u.s. department of agriculture. “out in the wild, feral hogs are an ecological nightmare. there is very little that is beneficial to native wildlife that come from feral swine,” grant said.

" no evidence has emerged to suggest russian hacking influenced the outcome of the u.s. presidential election and it would be irresponsible to jump to conclusions before receiving a final intelligence report, donald trump’s spokesman said on monday. “there is zero evidence that they influenced the election,” sean spicer told fox news. due to become white house press secretary when trump enters the white house on jan. 20, spicer told cnn the president elect would see the intelligence report once it was completed later this week. on saturday, trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on russia for the hacking of u.s. emails. “the idea that we’re jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is irresponsible,” spicer told cnn.     president barack obama expelled 35 russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two russian intelligence agencies last week for alleged kremlin involvement in hacking that intelligence officials said aimed to help the republican trump defeat democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. leading lawmakers from both parties have voiced alarm at the suggestion of russian interference, whether or not it made a difference in the outcome. republican john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, has scheduled a thursday hearing on foreign cyber threats. the new congress, elected on nov. 8, takes office on tuesday. calling for closer ties with russian president vladimir putin, trump has repeatedly played down the hacking affair. over the weekend trump said he knew “things that other people don’t know” and would disclose some information on the issue on tuesday or wednesday. he gave no further detail. “he’s going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand,” spicer told cnn. “he’s not going to reveal anything that was privileged or shared with him classified.”  on sunday spicer said the white house may have disproportionately punished russia.     “it’s baffling,” u.s. representative eric swalwell, a democrat on the house intelligence committee, told msnbc on monday. “president elect trump does not have any better information than president obama.” a gallup poll released on monday showed less than half of americans were confident in trump’s ability to handle an international crisis, to use military force wisely or to prevent major scandals in his administration.  the poll said at least seven in 10 americans were confident in presidents obama, george w. bush and bill clinton in those areas before they took office.

" the united states has circulated a draft u.n. security council resolution that would extend by two years the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in syria, after russia vetoed an extension last week. the u.s. draft, which was seen by reuters on thursday, says syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons, and it calls on all parties in syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe. the investigation by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons   known as the joint investigative mechanism (jim)   was unanimously created by the 15 member security council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. its mandate is due to expire in mid november. the jim found that the syrian government of bashar al assad was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition held town of khan sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in april, according to a report sent to the security council on oct. 26. two days earlier, russia vetoed a renewal of the jim mandate after it was unsuccessful in getting the security council to postpone the vote. u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia said russia wanted to discuss the khan sheikhoun report before the vote. russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the syrian army, says there is no evidence to show damascus was responsible for the attack. it maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not assad’s government. [nl8n1n86i0] on wednesday, the united states admonished russia for its veto. [nl2n1n805y] “russia’s attempts to undermine and eliminate the jim show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,” the white house said in a statement.  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson by phone on thursday it was unacceptable to politicize the work of chemical weapons inspectors in syria, russia’s foreign ministry said. [nl8n1mp0gi] a russian draft resolution calls for a six month extension of the inquiry, with the possibility of further extensions, and asks for investigators to collect environmental samples in connection with the khan sheikhoun probe, among other things. in their 14th report since 2011, u.n. investigators said in september they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. [nl8n1ln29p] twenty seven were by the assad government, including seven between march 1 and july 7. perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. the assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. it said its strikes in khan sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, an assertion “excluded” by u.n. commission of inquiry on syria chairman paulo pinheiro. that attack led u.s. president donald trump to launch the first u.s. air strikes on a syrian air base.

" a stock trading algorithm built for reuters highlights the correlations among gun purchases, mass shootings and the politics of gun regulation. with the benefit of hindsight, the boston based hedge fund quantopian examined how a theoretical investor would have fared by investing equal amounts in smith & wesson holding corp swhc.o and sturm ruger & co (rgr.n) after 20 events that impacted the companies’ sales or stock prices. the events, chosen by reuters, included 12 mass shootings, starting with the 2007 virginia tech shooting; six events involving president barack obama, including two elections and various calls for gun regulation; and two u.s. supreme court decisions favorable to gun companies.     hedge funds and other sophisticated investors use computer driven algorithms to place trades based on a defined set of instructions.  in the theoretical exercise for reuters, the quantopian algorithm showed that buying the two gun stocks the first trading day after the events and selling them 90 days later would have produced a return of 365 percent over a nine year period – compared to 66 percent for the s&p 500 index. a buy and hold bet on smith & wesson stock starting in january 2007 would have produced a return of 137 percent. for a graphic showing how the algorithm performed, see tmsnrt.rs/1oshshu ",0

" the premiers of two regions where the far right alternative for germany (afd) party made big gains in sunday s national election warned that chancellor angela merkel s conservatives must change course to stop the former east germany s rightward drift. merkel s christian democrats (cdu) suffered big losses across much of germany in the election, in which the afd, with its anti immigration message, became the first far right party in the national parliament in over half a century. the calls for a rightward shift add to the challenge merkel faces as she tries to assemble an already tricky three party coalition including the left wing greens, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and her own increasingly fractious party. prospects for a three way pact nonetheless improved on saturday when the greens voted at a special congress to start exploratory talks on a deal despite reservations about the other parties  harder line immigration policies. the afd s surge prompted soul searching within the conservative camp, with many blaming merkel s 2015 decision to open the doors to over a million migrants fleeing war and poverty in the middle east and africa for the far right s surge. the conservative premiers of saxony, where the afd topped polls, and of saxony anhalt called for the cdu to move to the right to stem the losses.  people want germany to stay germany,  said stanislaw tillich, premier of saxony, in an interview with the funke newspaper network.  they don t want parallel societies and rising criminality.  rainer haseloff, premier of saxony anhalt, echoed this, telling newspaper die welt:  people want to know how germany will preserve its identity.  these calls align the two influential state leaders more closely with the cdu s bavarian sister party, the christian social union (csu), which wants a hard immigration ceiling. while both premiers stuck to merkel s line that a firm upper limit would be impractical, their calls for the state to take a firmer hand with immigrants could strengthen the csu s hand as the sister parties attempt to thrash out a common position ahead of coalition talks with the fdp and greens. some warn that a black (cdu) yellow (fdp) green  jamaica coalition , risks heightening a sense of alienation among voters in the former east germany. given the losses all three parties had suffered in the east,  a jamaica coalition would be seen as a west german coalition in the east,  green mp canan bayram said. but merkel, in a podcast released on saturday, warned against treating germany s poorer east as a homogenous bloc.  we see these fears of globalisation, of anonymity, about old age care everywhere, including in the west,  she said.  we have to get people listening, to win people over by solving their problems. that s my task.

" the u.s. government took the legal battle over president donald trump’s travel ban to a higher court on friday, saying it would appeal against a federal judge’s decision that struck down parts of the ban on the day it was set to go into effect. the department of justice said in a court filing it would appeal against a ruling by u.s. district judge theodore chuang in maryland to the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in richmond, virginia. on thursday, chuang issued an emergency halt to the portion of trump’s march 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of travelers from six muslim majority countries. he left in place the section of the order that barred the entry of refugees to the united states for four months. another federal judge in hawaii struck down both sections of the ban in a broader court ruling that prevented trump’s order from moving forward. in washington state, where the ban is also being challenged, u.s. district court judge james robart put a stay on proceedings for as long as the hawaii court’s nationwide temporary restraining order remained in place, to “conserve resources” and avoid inconsistent and duplicate rulings. the decisions came in response to lawsuits brought by states’ attorneys general in hawaii and refugee resettlement agencies in maryland who were represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center. detractors argue the ban discriminated against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom. trump says the measure is necessary for national security to protect the country from terrorist attacks. white house press secretary sean spicer told a media briefing the government would “vigorously defend this executive order” and appeal against the “flawed rulings.” the department of justice filed a motion late on friday night seeking clarification of hawaii’s ruling before appealing to the 9th circuit u.s. court of appeals in san francisco.  the 9th circuit court last month upheld a decision by judge robart that halted an original, more sweeping travel ban signed by the president on jan. 27 in response to a lawsuit filed by washington state.  the new executive order was reissued with the intention of overcoming the legal concerns. trump has vowed to take the fight all the way to u.s. supreme court. the 4th circuit is known as a more conservative court compared to the 9th circuit, said buzz frahn, an attorney at simpson thacher & bartlett who has been tracking the litigation nationwide. “the government is probably thinking that the 4th circuit ... would lend a friendlier ear to its arguments,” he said.  judges have said they were willing to look behind the text of the order, which does not mention islam, to probe the motivation for enacting the ban, frahn said. trump promised during the election campaign to ban muslims from entering the united states. the u.s. supreme court is currently split 4 4 between liberals and conservatives, with trump’s pick for the high court    appeals court judge neil gorsuch   still awaiting confirmation. hans von spakovsky, from the washington d.c. based heritage foundation, said the department of justice might want to time their appeals to reach the supreme court after gorsuch is confirmed. he said the court would be likely to hear the case. “they will take it because of its national importance,” spakovsky said.

" pyongyang does not plan to hold any talks with washington about its nuclear program, a senior north korean diplomat said on friday, declaring that possessing nuclear weapons was a matter of life and death for north korea, the ria news agency reported. tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by north korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between u.s. president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un. trump, in a speech last month at the united nations, threatened to  totally destroy  north korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the north s leader a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. choe son hui, director general of the north american department of north korea s foreign ministry, told a non proliferation conference in moscow washington would  have to put up  with north korea s nuclear status, ria reported.  this is a matter of life and death for us. the current situation deepens our understanding that we need nuclear weapons to repel a potential attack.   we will respond to fire with fire.  pyongyang would regard any attempts to strangle the country via u.n. security council sanctions as an attempt  to declare war . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov, addressing the same conference earlier on friday, urged world powers to get behind a joint russian chinese roadmap for settling the crisis over north korea s weapons program.  we are convinced that its implementation will promote the lessening of military activity and tension on the korean peninsula and the forming in northeastern asia of a system of equal and indivisible security,  he said.  the plan proposes a moratorium on north korea s missile and nuclear weapons tests, while south korea and the united states suspend holding military exercises.  the main task at the current stage is to prevent a military conflict which will inevitably lead to a large scale humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe,  lavrov said.  all the sides involved should exercise restraint.

" colombia s armed forces have been authorized to launch air raids against crime gangs and farc members who have refused to adhere to a peace accord with the former guerilla group and instead chose to continue drug trafficking and other criminal activity, the defense ministry said on tuesday. as many as 1,000 members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) have not abided by the terms of last year s peace agreement with the government, preferring instead to remain armed, fight the government and profit from illegal drugs and mining. the conflict killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964. the executive order allows troops to conduct bomb attacks against farc dissidents and crime gangs from airplanes and helicopters, and shields the military from criminal prosecution, the defense ministry said in a statement. raids can only be carried out if civilians are not close by. air raids were the most effective weapon in the government s fight against the farc, pushing fighters deep into inhospitable jungle and killing high level rebel commanders. that strategy also has been used against the national liberation army (eln), now the biggest active guerrilla group in colombia, which is  in peace talks with the government. the two sides began a bilateral ceasefire in october. more than 11,300 members of the farc, including fighters, urban militia and prisoners are in the process of being incorporated into society after the group handed in its weapons to the united nations and formed a political party.

" a compromise version of a massive u.s. defense policy bill omits controversial provisions such as a clause democrats said allowed discrimination against homosexuals and a requirement that women register for the draft. the $618.7 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, will likely come up for a vote in the house of representatives late this week, and the senate next week, senior committee staff members told reporters at a background briefing on tuesday. during months of negotiations, republicans and democrats on the senate and house armed services committees agreed to eliminate a “religious freedom” provision democrats said would have let federal contractors discriminate against workers on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. the amendment, introduced by republican representative steve russell, would have overridden president barack obama’s 2014 executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. the 2017 ndaa also leaves out a requirement that women register for the military draft. many republican lawmakers, uneasy with moves toward allowing women in combat, had objected to that provision. instead, the ndaa requires a study of the entire selective service system.  the bill also provides a 2.1 percent increase in military pay, the biggest such raise in five years. the bill could run into problems with democrats. it includes $3.2 billion more in defense spending than obama requested, which is not matched by a similar increase in non defense spending. obama vetoed last year’s ndaa because of a similar increase for the pentagon, part of a continuing tug of war between republicans and democrats over spending policy. the ndaa keeps language restricting transfers from the military prison at the guantanamo bay naval base that was included in previous bills. those restrictions were one reason obama vetoed the 2016 ndaa, but he later signed a version of the legislation that included them. lawmakers also agreed to slash the white house’s national security council to no more than 200 positions, from about 400, after pentagon complaints the nsc was too involved in decision making. the ndaa expands a program to provide visas to afghans who worked for the u.s. military and diplomats as interpreters, allowing a further 1,500 visas. it omits protections for the greater sage grouse. house republicans do not want the bird to be declared an endangered species, arguing it would put too much land in the western united states off limits for military training.

" no free fruit in hotel rooms, no free hair cuts and no prawns on the menu   delegates at this week s communist party congress in china can expect austere treatment in keeping with president xi jinping s pledge to crack down on corruption and extravagance. part of xi s fight against deep seated graft has been to ensure officials are not seen abusing their positions and wasting public money, after a series of scandals involving high living bureaucrats ignited public anger. wang lilian, who has helped oversee hospitality for delegates at three previous party congresses, told state radio in remarks reported on sunday that this time, things are going to be very different. delegates will, for example, find their hotels bereft of the large welcoming banners and displays of flowers common in previous years. but the biggest difference will be with their rooms and food, wang said.  there won t be any more fruit put out in rooms, whereas previously there were for delegates and staff. there s none of that this time,  he said. the food was also going to be home style and simple, wang said.  there s no sea cucumber, prawns or the like. it s all buffet style.  delegates won t get free hair cuts or beauty treatments and there won t be any gift shops.  there s none of these services this time,  wang said. xi himself has lead the way in promoting simple living, with state media widely reporting on the basic food he eats when on trips around the country, and giving extensive coverage to cases where officials are found to have hoarded gold, owned multiple houses or had a fondness for banquets. xi has warned, like others before him, that if corruption is not tackled it could affect the party s grip on power. the once in five years congress opens on wednesday with a major speech by xi.

" the u.s. senate on wednesday rejected a resolution to revoke an obama era rule to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands, dealing a blow to president donald trump’s efforts to free the drilling industry from what he sees as excessive environmental regulation. the congressional review act resolution received just 49 votes after republican leaders scrambled for weeks to secure the 51 needed to pass it. the resolution would have revoked the rule and prevented similar regulations from being introduced. getting the trump administration to repeal the blm rule had been a top priority of the oil and gas industry. companies said it was unnecessary, would could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well and hinder production. but not all republicans supported the measure, in part because it would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.  republican senator john mccain of arizona made a surprise vote against the resolution, joining fellow republicans lindsey graham of south carolina and susan collins of maine in opposition to torpedo it. “while i am concerned that the blm rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar’,” mccain said in a statement. he said the interior department should issue a new rule on to replace the existing one on methane leaks, which he called a public health and air quality issue. the rule, finalized by president barack obama in his last weeks in office, updated 30 year old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production. obama’s administration said it would preserve up to 41 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per year that is currently lost to leaks and flaring. the american petroleum institute and other industry groups have said the methane rule is unnecessary because companies have made strides in reducing leaks on their own.  “the rule could impede u.s. energy production while reducing local and federal revenues,” said erik milito, api’s upstream and industry operations group director. members of the western energy alliance, which include devon energy , whiting petroleum and eog resources  had also been strongly opposed to the rule. environmental groups hailed what they depicted as a rare victory for the environment after several regulatory rollbacks by the trump administration. “in recent months, thousands of americans asked the senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today,” said jamie williams, president of the wilderness society. the western values project estimated that if the rule had been rescinded, the u.s. treasury would have lost out on $800 million in lost potential royalties from leaked or vented natural gas over the next decade. republican senator john barrasso of wyoming, chairman of the senate committee on environment and public works who supported the resolution to kill the rule, called on interior secretary ryan zinke to act unilaterally to revoke it.

" u.s. president donald trump on thursday declared the opioid epidemic a national emergency and said his administration was drafting papers to make it official. “the opioid crisis is an emergency and i’m saying officially right now it is an emergency,” trump told reporters in new jersey. “we’re going to draw it up and we’re going to make it a national emergency. it is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had.” trump spoke about a week after a white house commission on the opioid crisis led by new jersey governor chris christie recommended the president declare it a national emergency. the declaration could help unlock more support and resources to address the drug overdose epidemic, such as additional funding and expanded access to various forms of treatment, and it gives the government more flexibility in waiving rules and restrictions to expedite action. national emergencies are typically declared for short term crises, such as the zika virus outbreak or a natural disaster. it is unclear what trump’s declaration will mean for a complex, long term public health problem.  “we’re going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis,” trump said. “this is a worldwide problem, not just a united states problem.” more than 100 americans die of drug overdoses every day, the commission wrote in a report, noting that “america is enduring a death toll equal to september 11th every three weeks.” opioids played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. trump held a “major briefing” on the epidemic on tuesday, but stopped short of following the commission’s recommendation. instead, he talked mostly about stopping the flow of drugs into the united states and ensuring young people never start using drugs. he did not discuss access to treatment.

" donald trump has backed away from a total ban on muslims entering the united states, vice presidential running mate mike pence said on thursday, a shift from one of the republican presidential candidate’s most provocative proposals. trump’s call last december for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states” followed an islamic state inspired mass shooting in san bernardino, california, by a husband and wife team. critics have called the proposed ban discriminatory and probably a violation of the u.s. constitution’s guarantee of freedom of religion, and democrats have used trump’s policy to declare him a bigot. in recent months, trump has said he would suspend immigration from countries where islamist militants are active but has left vague as to whether this amounted to a narrowing or an expansion of his original policy position.pence said in a round of television interviews that if elected on nov. 8, trump would suspend immigration from “countries that have been compromised by terrorism.” asked if this amounted to a ban on muslims, pence said on msnbc’s “morning joe” show: “of course not.” on cnn’s “new day,” pence was asked why, given that he had been against the ban before becoming trump’s running mate, he was not opposing it now.” “well, because it’s not donald trump’s position now,” replied pence.

" u.s. president donald trump on tuesday urged senate republicans to pass a “generous” replacement program for obamacare, as the senate struggled to produce an alternative to the healthcare law. capitol hill sources who asked not to be named said trump described the version of the legislation that passed the house last month as “mean.” that house bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from insurance protections for people with pre existing conditions. trump discussed the healthcare bill at a white house lunch he hosted for republican senators in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. the white house declined to comment on private conversations between trump and lawmakers. during the portion of the lunch open to reporters, trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be “generous” and “kind.” “that may be adding additional money into it,” he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. trump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet tuesday morning declaring that the affordable care act, nicknamed obamacare, “is in a death spiral.” he cited the government’s announcement monday that some 2 million people who signed up for obamacare have dropped out this year.  although trump’s republican party has a majority in both houses of congress, trump blamed “obstructionist” democrats for the lack of progress in repealing president barack obama’s signature domestic achievement. senator john thune, the no. 3 republican in the senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost sharing payments to health insurers under obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue. those payments help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income americans. trump has said he might consider withholding them but insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. thune also said trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill. “i hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the fourth of july break,” thune said.       the house of representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but senate republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. the senators trump invited to lunch included republicans from both ideological camps. moderates susan collins and lisa murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives ted cruz and mike lee. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the august recess. senate aides said the senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in obamacare for people with pre existing medical conditions, after the controversy over the house bill that would let states seek waivers from those protections. in states with such waivers, people with pre existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. another senator at the lunch, finance committee chairman orrin hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.  “the total bill hasn’t been resolved,” he said.

" president donald trump said on tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow americans to buy stripped down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the obamacare law that trump opposes. unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a congress led by his own party, trump indicated he would take unilateral action. he offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” costing the united states “nothing.” the expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements. these include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment.  it would also expand the amount of time people can use short term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. people could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law.  “i’ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,” trump told reporters in the oval office. “with congress the way it is, i decided to take it upon myself,” trump added, saying the plan is “largely worked out.” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will make his announcement “by the end of friday.” trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. the association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. it is unclear when these plans would become available. it is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins nov. 1.  experts questioned trump’s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare. the plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 affordable care act, dubbed obamacare. that could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the trump administration.  experts said trump’s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the law’s protection that people with pre existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. “there’s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,” said craig garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at northwestern university’s kellogg school of management, referring to the trump administration.  “it unwinds the ability of people with pre existing conditions to get insurance under the aca,” garthwaite said. republicans have failed to make good on their seven year promise to repeal and replace obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of trump’s democratic predecessor barack obama. gutting obamacare was a top trump campaign promise. trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it “implode,” has undermined obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. last week, the u.s. department of health and human services issued a rule that will let businesses and non profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co payment. trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under obamacare. the payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out of pocket medical costs for low income consumers. insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums.  his administration has slashed the obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law.

" the israeli military said it attacked a hamas training compound in gaza on monday in response to rocket strikes from the palestinian enclave, which have surged since u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel s capital on dec 6. neither side reported any casualties in the overnight shelling exchange, which occurred days before u.s. vice president mike pence visits israel and neighboring egypt, which also borders gaza and is involved in its internal politics. militants in gaza, territory controlled by the hamas islamist group, have launched more than a dozen rockets into southern israel over the last two weeks, the most intensive attacks since a seven week long gaza war in 2014. two rockets were fired late on sunday, one of them exploding inside an israeli border community and the other hitting an open area, the military said. another rocket launched early on monday fell short inside gaza, it said. three structures in a hamas training camp were hit in the israeli counter strike, the military said. hamas usually evacuates such facilities when tensions rise, and israel s choice of the low profile target appeared to signal a desire to avoid more serious confrontation with the group.  israel does not seek escalation,  justice minister ayelet shaked said on army radio. but zeev elkin, another member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s security cabinet, said in an interview with the radio station that israel s military response would  have to be harshened  if the rocket fire did not stop. israeli officials have blamed the fire on smaller militant groups in gaza and called on hamas to rein them in. should hamas fail to do so, both shaked and elkin said, israel could eventually target the group s leadership for attack.

" two studies that president donald trump hopes will buttress his case to cut the number of refugees are at the heart of a fight between senior white house adviser stephen miller and career u.s. government officials over immigration policy, four current and former officials said.     trump in march ordered the u.s. state department and other agencies to tally only the costs of resettling refugees but not the benefits that policy experts said refugees can also bring, including tax revenues, professional skills and job creation. a current official said miller had convened meetings with state department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports. when department specialists proposed including refugees’ economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment, miller rebuffed the idea, one current and one former u.s. official said. the white house said miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that trump’s overall fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sought to “make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy.” the current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe, however, that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis. “it’s a policy outcome in search of a rationale,” said a former u.s. official familiar with the debate. the white house disputed the notion that miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports, which are to be compiled mainly by the state department’s bureau of population, refugees and migration (prm).  “the idea that we are ordering biased reports is false,” said michael short, a white house spokesman. the tensions over the reports, due in september, have not been previously reported. miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration. he  was the architect of trump’s order in january suspending the refugee program for 120 days and refugees from syria indefinitely. that order, which also temporarily barred travelers from seven muslim majority countries, was largely blocked by the courts, as was a second executive order. miller was not available for an interview. r.c. hammond, a senior adviser to secretary of state rex tillerson, said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled miller “suggesting the state department review the methodology and findings of existing studies” on refugees. “essentially, suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn,” hammond said in an email. “my colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information.” hammond he did not identify the state department staffer. tensions in the government over trump’s immigration policies began with trump’s executive order, which prompted about 900 state department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in january. weeks later, the right wing breitbart website, which has close ties to the white house, published a story calling for the firing   among others   of the two top officials in the department of health and human services’ office of refugee resettlement and three senior officials at the prm bureau. breitbart listed the officials by name, but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs. career officials cannot be fired, but can be reassigned. there is no evidence the five have been reassigned. trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his 2016 presidential campaign. he called at one point for a complete ban on muslims entering the united states, citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by islamist militants. for the first report, trump ordered a tally of “the estimated long term costs of the united states refugee admissions program at the federal, state, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.” trump directed that the second report estimate “how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long term cost as supporting refugees in the united states, taking into account the full lifetime cost of federal, state, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere.” refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in third country camps for a given sum than settled in the united states, that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can. most studies show that refugees entering the united states require more government services than immigrants as a whole. but scholars differ over the long term economic impact of accepting refugees, which can depress low skilled workers’ wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive. during their first eight years in the united states, refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, a study published this month by the nonprofit national bureau for economic research said. “after the eighth year, taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received,” by an average of $21,000 over a 20 year period, the study found. jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies, which favors limiting immigration, agreed that accountings such as those trump ordered should not be limited to costs.  “it’s only fair to consider any fiscal benefits,” she said. the four current and former u.s. officials said the high level white house focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome trump wants. “when the white house calls and expresses interest...in a report of this nature, given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about, that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy,” one of the former officials said.

" aid agencies have to step up operations  massively  in response to the arrival in bangladesh of about 400,000 refugees fleeing violence in myanmar, and the amount of money needed to help them has risen sharply, a senior u.n. official said on wednesday. the exodus of muslim rohingya to bangladesh began on aug. 25 after rohingya militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp. the attacks triggered a sweeping military counter offensive by security forces in buddhist majority myanmar which the u.n. rights agency said was a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  we will all have to ramp up our response massively, from food to shelter,  george william okoth obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the u.n. refugee agency, told reuters during a visit to the kutupalong refugee camp in bangladesh.  the united nations said on tuesday 370,000 people had crossed into bangladesh but okoth obbo estimated the figure was now 400,000. he declined to speculate on how many more might come. bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 rohingya, who fled earlier conflict in myanmar including a similar security crackdown in western myanmar s rakhine state in response to militant attacks in october. many of the new arrivals are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season.  we have an emergency within an emergency with conditions in existing camps,  he said, pointing to a mud clogged road in the camp. last week, the united nations appealed for $77 million to cope with the crisis but okoth obbo said that would not now be enough.  the appeal that was issued of $77 million on behalf of the aid agencies was based on the situation as it was roughly about two weeks ago,  he said.  there were only 100,000 people then. we are already four times that figure now. the funds need clearly is going to continue.  he declined to say how much he thought was needed. he also declined to say if he thought aid agencies were getting proper access to the conflict zone in myanmar, though he said it was important to ensure that people were safe where they were.  of course, also that access is provided to all the responders to provide humanitarian assistance,  he added. myanmar has restricted most aid agency access to the north of rakhine. some officials have accused aid agencies of supporting the insurgents. okoth obbo said he agreed with the bangladeshi position that the most important solution was for the refugees to be able to return home in safety. bangladeshi prime minister sheikh hasina said on tuesday the refugees would all have to go home and myanmar should set up safe zones to enable them to do so.  under difficult circumstances this country has kept its borders open,  okoth obbo said of bangladesh.  all of us should support that and ensure that the response is strong.

" new jersey governor chris christie is barred by state law from running for a third consecutive four year term this year, but the unpopular former republican presidential candidate remains a central figure in the campaign to replace him. voters head to the polls on tuesday to choose republican and democratic nominees to succeed christie, whose approval ratings have hit historic lows. he has been accused of spending too much time out of state during the 2016 presidential campaign and tarnished by the so called bridgegate lane closure scandal. the lieutenant governor, kim guadagno, is the front runner in the primary election on the republican side, while phil murphy, a former goldman sachs group inc executive who served as u.s. ambassador to germany under former president barack obama, holds a solid lead in polling among the democrats. guadagno, who won election as the state’s first lieutenant governor alongside christie in 2009, was monmouth county’s first elected female sheriff and, like christie, served as a federal prosecutor. with christie absent frequently during the presidential campaign, guadagno has already spent months as acting governor. but she has also faced criticism from her opponents based on her association with the unpopular republican incumbent. as a result, guadagno, 58, has tried to execute a balancing act, distancing herself from christie on some issues like his $300 million proposal to renovate the aging statehouse in trenton while taking credit for the state’s low unemployment figures. “in most situations where you have a second in command, that person will enjoy some incumbency advantage,” said brigid callahan harrison, a political science professor at montclair university in new jersey. “in fact, what we see is the exact opposite. his enormous unpopularity is an albatross around her candidacy.” at a recent debate, guadagno sparred with her main republican rival, assemblyman jack ciatterelli, over the latter’s plan to hike taxes on millionaires. guadagno has vowed not to raise any taxes. ciatterelli, 55, has criticized christie, and by extension guadagno, for the state’s repeated credit rating downgrades in the face of budget problems. the latest stockton university poll, released last week, gave guadagno 37 percent support among primary voters, with ciatterelli trailing at 18 percent. about a third of those polled, however, said they remained undecided. on the democratic side, murphy, 59, appears likely to capture the nomination after significantly outspending his opponents. he has loaned $15 million to his own campaign, and the money has given him an advantage in advertising. his strategy of spending early and often helped him eliminate some potentially strong rivals, including state senate president stephen sweeney and jersey city mayor steven fulop. murphy also enjoys support from both new jersey and national democratic leaders. former vice president joe biden campaigned with him this week, and all 21 new jersey county democratic organizations have endorsed him. his opponents have criticized his wall street background and  campaign spending, but he had 34 percent support in the latest stockton university poll, as much as all other candidates combined. jim johnson, 56, a lawyer and former u.s. treasury department official under former president bill clinton, had 10 percent in that poll, after running as an “outsider” candidate.  assemblyman john wisniewski, who helped lead the legislature’s investigation into the bridgegate scandal, was at 9 percent. christie has denied any involvement in the bridgegate plot, but the scandal continued to dog him. two former associates were convicted in november of scheming to close down lanes at the george washington bridge in 2013 to punish a mayor for failing to endorse christie’s re election campaign. wisniewski, who chaired the state campaign for former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders, appeared poised to challenge murphy, a hillary clinton supporter, from the left. but in a state where clinton easily defeated sanders in 2016, he has failed to garner a groundswell of support. all the democratic candidates have endorsed a fairly liberal agenda, including a $15 minimum wage and marijuana legalization. the democractic primary winner will seek to tie the republican nominee to christie and by extension to u.s. president donald trump. christie was among the first prominent republicans to back trump’s candidacy last year. murphy’s final tv ad of the primary season, airing in the days before tuesday’s election, appealed to voters to “stop donald trump’s assault on our values.” the primary winners will compete in a nov. 7 election.

" a u.s. congressional panel has warned of an “alarming” rise in china’s interference in hong kong, noting fears over the former british colony’s continued role as a global financial hub. in its annual report to congress on wednesday, the bipartisan u.s. china economic and security review commission highlights the “chilling” abduction and detention of five booksellers based in hong kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms. britain handed hong kong back to china in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide ranging autonomy remain intact. the commission, in a detailed 33 page section, urges a fresh probe from the state department into hong kong’s autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight. “hong kong’s traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the united states, as u.s. trade and investment ties with hong kong are substantial,” the report notes. it says the booksellers’ detentions   including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside hong kong   broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in september’s legislative election. “this incident has threatened the maintenance of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and led some observers to question hong kong’s status as a leading global financial hub,” the report warns. “the election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in hong kong.” u.s. senators marco rubio and tom cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze u.s. based assets and ban u.s. entry of those responsible for the “surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in hong kong”, according to a statement on rubio’s senate website. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said hong kong was an internal matter for china and no foreign country had the right to interfere. “in order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support,” geng told a daily news briefing. “those who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed.” the report comes amid deepening concerns in beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. the high court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted china when taking their oath of office, from the legislature. in a statement after the report’s release, the hong kong government said the “one country, two systems” principle was being implemented successfully, as was the city’s role as a global commercial hub. it also urged foreign parties not to interfere. the booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland china but freely available in hong kong. their plight fueled western governments’ concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests. one of the five men, swedish passport holder gui minhai, who disappeared from the thai resort of pattaya last october, is the only one still in detention in china. another, lam wing kee, returned to hong kong in june, saying he had been held captive by chinese agents for eight months.  the report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of china’s broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the south china sea and taiwan.

" the u.s. military said on friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on iran in support of president donald trump s new strategy, which promises a far more confrontational approach to tehran. trump struck a blow against the 2015 iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. he also promised to address iran more broadly, including its support for extremist groups in the middle east. major adrian rankine galloway, a defense department spokesman, told reuters the pentagon was assessing the positioning of its forces as well as planning but offered few details.  we are identifying new areas where we will work with allies to put pressure on the iranian regime, neutralize its destabilizing influences, and constrain its aggressive power projection, particularly its support for terrorist groups and militants,  he said. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said his first goal would to talk with u.s. allies in europe, the middle east and elsewhere to gain a shared understanding of iran s actions.  certainly we intend to dissuade them from shipping arms into places like yemen and explosives into bahrain and the other things they do with their surrogates, like lebanese hezbollah,  mattis said. the u.s. military has long been a strident critic of iran, accusing it directly and indirectly of trying to undermine the united states and its allies, including in iraq, syria and yemen. the tensions escalated in recent months in syria, where american pilots shot down two iranian made drones this summer.   still, a more aggressive approach to iran could trigger a backlash from iran s elite islamic revolutionary guard corps (irgc) and forces that it backs. that includes in iraq, where u.s. troops are fighting islamic state and trying to keep their distance from shi ite militia aligned with iran.  u.s. forces in iraq are quite exposed, and coalition forces are quite exposed to the risk of attack if iranian elements so choose,  said jennifer cafarella, lead intelligence planner at the institute for the study of war, a think tank in washington. the u.s. military is analyzing an explosively formed penetrator, or efp, that killed an american soldier in iraq this month. the reappearance of the device, which iran backed shi ite militia routinely used to target american troops in iraq before their withdrawal in 2011, has startled u.s. officials. cia director mike pompeo noted the device was detonated in an area controlled by a militia backed by tehran.  we do not have evidence of a direct link to iran, but we are closely examining this tragic incident,  pompeo said on wednesday. cafarella said the killing of the u.s. soldier may have been a warning from iran.  i think it is possible that the iranians have been attempting to signal their commitment to retaliate against the u.s. strategy,  she said. mattis said the united states was watching for any new provocations from iran. asked whether he thought tehran might retaliate, he said:  it would be ill advised for them to attack us.  reuters has previously reported that options to increase pressure on iran include more aggressive u.s. interceptions of iranian arms shipments, such as those to houthi rebels in yemen, it could also direct u.s. naval forces to react more forcefully when harassed by armed irgc speed boats. the pentagon on friday detailed a series of major concern about iran, including its ballistic missile development and cyber attacks against the united states and u.s. allies.  the pentagon promised to review u.s. security cooperation activities with allies in the region, something that could lead to alterations in u.s. arms sales and military exercises.  it also signaled a willingness to re examine the positioning of the roughly 70,000 american troops the pentagon says are stationed in the middle east. still, mattis said:  right now we are not changing our posture.

" australian private security on tuesday vacated an asylum seeker detention center in papua new guinea (png) ahead of its planned closure, detainees said, leaving about 600 refugees and asylum seekers barricaded inside and refusing to move. detainees are defying attempts by australia and png to close the controversial manus island center, saying they fear violent reprisals from the local community if they move to a transit center. despite threats that water and power supply to the camp would be cut by 5 p.m. (0700 gmt), asylum seekers told reuters after the deadline that half the camp still had power at 10.30 p.m. (1230 gmt), along with access to water.  the manus center has been a key part of australia s controversial  sovereign borders  immigration policy. the country refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in png and nauru in the south pacific. lawyers for some of the 600 men filed a last minute lawsuit in png to prevent the camp s closure and allow the men to be relocated to a third country. a ruling is expected on wednesday. the detainees were left alone for the first time in more than four years after camp staff all left on tuesday morning, sudanese refugee abdul aziz told reuters.  the water and electricity are still on but we are vulnerable now after the staff left us all alone,  aziz said. the camp s impending closure is part of an australian government plan to push refugees and asylum seekers to return to their home country, settle in png or move elsewhere, so dismantling part of the costly and controversial offshore detention program. the united nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers. detainees have consistently raised concerns over how they are treated by locals and authorities in png, a country that ranks 154th out of 185 on the united nation s human development index. australian immigration minister peter dutton refused to comment on the departure of the australian employed security staff on manus, but said the camp s closure would proceed.  all have been informed for a considerable period of time that there is safe and secure alternate accommodation where health and other services will be maintained,  dutton said in an emailed statement. australia has already said it would spend up to a$250 million ($195 million) to house the men for the next 12 months. just under 200 men have already been moved.  the relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the united states time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. asylum seekers said several unidentified local men had arrived at the camp and taken away furniture from common areas. videos images shot by the refugees and sent to reuters show vans loaded with furniture departing, though it is not clear where the vehicles were from. conditions for the refugees were unbearable, said nick mckim, a senator with the australian greens party who is on manus.   i can only describe what is happening on manus now as a humanitarian emergency,  mckim told reuters.  it is 31 degrees celsius (88 fahrenheit) today and drinking water will be cut off.  png has sent paramilitary services to oversee the closure.  png s high court ruled last year that the manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal. most of the detainees come from war torn countries such as afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka and syria. australia s tough offshore detention policies are backed by its two biggest political parties, although community opinion is divided.  i would be absolutely terrified to be in that situation and i cannot understand why the government just simply will not say enough is enough ... we need to bring them here to australia,  said refugee advocate dr barri phatarfod, who joined in a small protest against refugee policies in sydney on tuesday.

" the leader of a pakistani militant group whose suicide bombings killed more than 250 people died on thursday of injuries from a u.s. drone strike in afghanistan, a spokesman for the militants said. omar khalid khorasani s death comes ahead of u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson s visit and is likely to help ease tensions between the often wary allies, as islamabad has been asking washington to target militants who attack inside pakistan and hide over the border in afghanistan. khorasani s jamaat ul ahrar (jua), a splinter faction of the pakistani taliban, is one of dozens of armed islamist factions   including al qaeda and the afghan taliban   operating in afghanistan and pakistan. but jua has been particularly deadly in pakistan, claiming responsibility for eight major attacks in two years. among them was last year s easter sunday bombing in a park that killed at least 70 people, including 29 children, in the eastern city of lahore. the group also said it carried out a suicide attack at a hospital that killed at least 74 people in the southwestern city of quetta, a bombing also claimed by islamic state, with which jua also has been affiliated. rumours had flown for two days that khorasani had been wounded in u.s. drone strikes along the afghan pakistani border, and on thursday his group confirmed he had died.  our leader, omar khalid khorasani, was wounded in one of the recent drone strikes in afghanistan. he was wounded badly, and today he was martyred,  jua spokesman asad mansur said by telephone. the announcement came a week after pakistan s army rescued a kidnapped american couple and their three children from the haqqani network, an afghan taliban faction that washington has long accused islamabad of failing to target. the killing of khorasani is likely to add to the recently improved mood between washington and islamabad, said talat masood, a retired pakistani general and prominent political analyst.  he was a very powerful leader and he had done great harm to pakistan,  masood said of khorasani.  i think pakistan has been looking forward to this, and i think the americans targeting him has been very helpful in that sense.  khorasani had a background that reads like a history of pakistani militancy. born abdul wali in a village called lakaro in the northwestern mohmand tribal region, khorasani started out as an anti india jihadist fighting in kashmir, according to a long time friend who spoke last year to reuters on condition of anonymity. he later joined the pakistani taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia islamic law. in 2014, khorasani left the pakistani taliban after a leadership quarrel to form jamaat ul ahrar. jua gained attention in september 2014 when it announced it was supporting islamic state and rejecting the main pakistani taliban leadership. by march 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main pakistani taliban umbrella leadership. still, jua never specifically disavowed islamic state either, and several attacks inside pakistan have been claimed by both groups. the united states last year designated jua as a terrorist group. khorasani had previously been seriously wounded in a nato air strike in eastern afghanistan in 2015 but later recovered.

" journalists from nbc, abc, cnn and fox news will moderate the three scheduled debates between u.s. presidential candidates hillary clinton and donald trump ahead of the nov. 8 election, the nonpartisan group organizing the events said on friday. nbc anchor lester holt will ask questions at the first debate on sept. 26 in new york, while abc global affairs correspondent martha raddatz and cnn anchor anderson cooper will co moderate the oct. 9 “town meeting” style debate in st. louis, the commission on presidential debates said.  fox news anchor chris wallace will moderate on oct. 19 in las vegas, it said in a statement. cbs journalist elaine quijano will moderate the single vice presidential debate on oct. 4 between republican indiana governor mike pence and his democratic rival, u.s. senator tim kaine of virginia, the commission said.  c span’s steve scully will be a back up moderator for all four of the debates, it added. trump, the republican candidate, has said he will take part in the three debates but wants to see the conditions. representatives for the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on friday’s announcement. the new york businessman, who has never held elected office, has had repeated run ins with the media since launching his campaign last year, charging networks like cnn with “phony reporting,” sparring with msnbc hosts and insulting fox news journalist megyn kelly. his campaign has also black listed several reporters and news outlets. clinton, the democratic candidate, has said she will participate in all three debates as scheduled.  separately, nbc has said trump and clinton will participate in a “commander in chief” forum focused on military issues on sept. 7 in new york, appearing separately. on friday, trump’s son eric raised questions about ties between the anchor for that event, matt lauer, and the clinton foundation and said nbc and its cable offshoot msnbc have been against his father. “obviously, there’s a lot of speculation because of his involvement with the foundation,” eric trump told fox news in an interview. “i hope he’ll be fair.” representatives for nbc said lauer was not a member of the foundation and that he had interviewed former president bill clinton for the network’s “today” show, not on behalf of the foundation. trump’s reality television show, “the apprentice,” debuted on nbc in 2004. nbc later cut other ties with the businessman, dropping his “miss usa” and “miss universe” pageants, and trump sued. nbc is a unit of comcast corp.. fox news is part of the twenty first century fox inc, abc news is owned by walt disney co, while time warner inc owns cnn. cbs corp is also publicly traded.

" president donald trump on tuesday ordered a review of the u.s. visa program for bringing high skilled foreign workers into the country, putting technology firms and the outsourcing companies that serve them on notice that possible changes may be ahead. seeking to carry out a campaign pledge to put “america first,” trump signed an executive order on the h 1b visa program. it was vague on many fronts, and did not change existing rules, but one objective, said trump aides, is to modify or replace the current lottery for h 1b visas with a merit based system that would restrict the visas to highly skilled workers. indian nationals are the largest group of h 1b recipients annually. such a change could affect companies, such as tata consultancy services ltd, cognizant tech solutions corp and infosys ltd, that connect u.s. technology companies with thousands of foreign engineers and programmers. none responded to requests for comment. trump announced the order and made remarks at a visit to the headquarters of snap on inc, a tool maker in wisconsin. in addition to addressing the visas issue, he also ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring american companies to see if they are actually benefiting, especially the u.s. steel industry. “with this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world: we’re going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put america first,” trump said. trump was a businessman before he was elected president last year, and his companies have been criticized for using visa programs to fill positions at trump properties with foreign workers. trump branded products are also made overseas. 100 day benchmark as he nears the 100 day benchmark of his presidency, trump still has no major legislative achievements. with his attempts to overhaul healthcare and tax law stalled in congress, trump has leaned heavily on executive orders to change policy. it was unclear whether the latest such order would yield immediate results. the h 1b visas section included no definite timeline. the government procurement section did. “we hope the goal of president trump’s executive order on the h 1b program is ‘mend it, don’t end it,’” said robert atkinson, president of the information technology and innovation foundation, a technology industry group. going to a more merit based h 1b system could attract more people with advanced science and technology skills, atkinson said in a statement. but he said some ideas could make the system ineffective, such as requiring advertisement of job openings for long periods to prove the unavailability of u.s. workers. democrats said trump’s order was not strong enough, and too late, after thousands of visas were awarded this month in this year’s lottery. “for a president who has prided himself on his swift action when it comes to immigration, an interagency review of the program is a guarded and timid approach. it’s too little, too late,” said u.s. senator dick durbin, the no.2 democrat in the senate. critics of the program say most h 1b visas are awarded for lower paid jobs at outsourcing firms, many based in india. that takes work away from americans, lowers wages and keeps americans from being trained in tech related fields, they say.   “right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing american workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries,” trump said. tech companies have been bracing for trump to make changes to the h 1b program. the visas are intended to go to foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge, such as science, engineering or computer programming. the government uses a lottery to award 65,000 visas yearly and randomly distributes another 20,000 to graduate student workers. critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower paid information technology workers.     “right now h 1b visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and that’s wrong. instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never, ever be used to replace americans,” trump said. more than 15 percent of facebook inc’s u.s. employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, according to a reuters analysis of u.s. labor department filings. facebook did not respond to requests for comment. infosys, india’s no. 2 it services firm, has said previously that it is ramping up work on on site development centers in the united states to train local talent in an effort to address the visa regulation changes under consideration. it warned last week that onerous changes to u.s. visa rules could affect its earnings.   nasscom, the indian it service industry’s main lobbying group, said it backs efforts to root out h 1b abuses, but said the idea that h 1b visa holders are cheap labor is inaccurate. indian prime minister narendra modi urged washington in february to be open minded on admitting skilled indian workers.

" the trump organization inc said on wednesday it has pulled out of a hotel venture in rio de janeiro that is part of a criminal investigation in brazil, with a trump hotels spokeswoman citing construction delays and differences in vision. the trump hotel rio de janeiro, a beachfront property with 170 rooms near where the olympic park was located, was managed by the real estate company of president elect donald trump, although no money from the trump organization was invested in the project. “unfortunately, the developers of the rio de janeiro hotel are significantly behind on the completion of the property, and their vision for the hotel no longer aligns with the trump hotels brand,” jennifer rodstrom, a spokesperson for trump hotels, said in an emailed statement on wednesday.  reuters reported in november that federal prosecutor anselmo lopes had opened a criminal investigation into investments made by two small state pension funds in the hotel. trump hotels declined to comment on whether the decision to pull out of the rio hotel had anything to do with the investigation. when opening the investigation, prosecutor lopes said the size, structure and risk of the investments in the hotel, owned and developed by brazil’s lsh barra empreendimentos imobiliários sa, was suspicious. “it is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds towards lsh barra empreendimentos imobiliários sa and the trump organization was due to illicit payments and bribes,” lopes said at the time. the trump organization and lsh deny any wrongdoing.  plans to build the hotel were announced in 2014, and it was meant to be ready in time for the olympics held in august. delays meant the hotel was only partially open during the games, however, with less than half of its rooms available.

" two groups that support far reaching curbs on legal immigration to the united states and ideological screening of would be immigrants to test their beliefs say donald trump’s presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy. numbersusa and the center for immigration studies, which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration, told reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year. trump’s campaign declined to confirm the meetings. trump, the republican nominee, has won over millions of supporters with his calls for a wall on the mexican border and a temporary ban on muslims entering the country. but the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad.  while trump’s immigration proposals push the republican party sharply to the right, numbersusa and cis also want to slash legal immigration, going beyond the new york businessman’s call to keep it “within historical norms.” numbersusa says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth, take jobs that should go to u.s. workers, and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats.  “the aim should be to halt all immigration possible,” numbersusa head roy beck wrote in a blog in march. numbersusa wants to cut legal immigration to 500,000 a year immediately, said chris chmielenski, the group’s director of content and activism. about a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the united states every year, according to the u.s. department of homeland security. around 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the united states in 2014, down from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to the pew research center. the head of cis, mark krikorian, has argued against legal immigration extensively. last year he wrote in the national review that mass legal immigration would end u.s. conservatism, because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights. beck told reuters he had met with trump in new york and had also spoken with people “at the top” of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn, when numbersusa accepted invitations to meet several republican presidential hopefuls. much of the contact was by phone and email. beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions. in early august, numbersusa shared a 10 point immigration plan with the trump campaign. of the 10 points, six were echoed by trump in a major immigration speech on aug. 31. those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the “e verify” system to check a job applicant’s legal status.  the trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap. the policy was written with input from senator jeff sessions of alabama, former new york mayor rudy giuliani, as well as immigration and customs enforcement officers and border patrol agents. beck said the overlap showed the “convergence” of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had “no indication that they sat down and looked at our 10 steps and said let’s take six of them.”     based in arlington, virginia, numbersusa describes itself as the “the nation’s largest grassroots immigration reduction organization with more than 5 million participants.” it is credited with helping block immigration bills in 2007 and 2013 that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens. krikorian, of cis, whose slogan is “low immigration, pro immigrant,” said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the trump campaign for months.  in an aug. 15 speech, trump outlined his plan for “extreme vetting” of immigrants, calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people “who share our values and respect our people.”  cis was an early proponent of ideological screening   widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought   to protect u.s. culture and national security following the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was unclear if trump consulted cis on the idea. the department of homeland security already requires people seeking legal status in the united states to show they adhere to the principles of the constitution. krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at trump’s new york headquarters in august, after which he said he was asked by trump’s campaign to be a “surrogate.” a surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign, by speaking at rallies and other events. krikorian said he turned down the trump campaign’s request.  hate watchdog groups like the southern poverty law center and the anti defamation league have accused numbersusa and cis of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism. “these are the organizations that are the leading edge of the nativist movement in this country,” said frank sharry, executive director of immigrants’ rights group america’s voice.  both organizations reject the claims. “we’re absolutely opposed to nativism,” said beck, adding that numbersusa’s recommendations come from a desire to protect american workers. his group stresses that it blames bad immigration policy and not immigrants themselves. krikorian said cis wants “an ethnically neutral policy that lets in fewer people in the future and does a better job of welcoming those people we do legally admit to our country.” (adds dropped word, “plan,” in paragraph 14.)

" yemen is “dismayed” by u.s. president donald trump’s decision  to temporarily ban its citizens from traveling to the united states, saying that the country was a victim of attacks itself, an official said on saturday. “we are dismayed by the decision to unilaterally ban, even for only a month, travel to the united states for people holding yemeni passports,” said the official, speaking on condition of  anonymity. yemen is one of seven muslim majority countries affected by a trump’s 90 day curb on travelers while his administration studies new ways to prevent potential militants from trying to enter the united states.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump on wednesday  ended his ban on press credentials for some news outlets seeking to cover his campaign events, including the washington post and buzzfeed, a policy that had drawn strong criticism from press freedom advocates. trump’s ban at times also included politico and the huffington post, following coverage that was critical of him. the banned organizations had continued covering his campaign, but they could not get credentials to formally attend his events, including sitting in the media section at rallies.  those outlets now will be able to obtain media credentials, as well as travel with other reporters covering the republican candidate, campaign spokesman hope hicks confirmed. press freedom advocates strongly condemned such bans. reporters without borders said when the post was banned in june that it was an “act of hostility” toward the media and a serious violation of press freedom. “revoking press credentials was imprudent, pointless and offensive from the start. we’re pleased to see the ban come to a long overdue end,” washington post executive editor marty baron said in a statement on wednesday. sam stein, senior politics editor for the huffington post, said on twitter the outlet was no longer blacklisted. “they even returned my email to confirm it,” he said of the trump campaign. reporters from the banned organizations had often gained access to trump campaign events by waiting in the same lines as the general public, but they could be tossed out by members of his security team if discovered. trump’s vice presidential running mate, indiana governor mike pence, said last month that the campaign was discussing reversing the ban, but no change had been announced before wednesday. “i figure they can’t treat me any worse,” trump, a new york businessman, told cnn in a statement declaring the ban over. trump is running against democrat hillary clinton for the nov. 8 election.

" the humanitarian situation in yemen is a  catastrophe , and cholera cases could reach a million by the end of the year, the international committee of the red cross said on friday. warring parties in yemen   including the western backed saudi led coalition   are all using disproportionate force, leading to  very excessive  civilian casualties, said alexandre faite, the head of the red cross delegation in yemen. in addition, suspected cases of cholera have reached 750,000, with 2,119 deaths, faite said, and the red cross expects at least 900,000 cases by the end of the year.  the situation has really evolved in a very dramatic way and i think that it s nothing short of a catastrophe,  faite told a news briefing in geneva.  civil war in yemen has killed more than 10,000 people since it began in march 2015. control of the country is split between  the iran aligned houthis, who control much of northern yemen, including the capital, sanaa. opposed to the houthis are a saudi led coalition. with the main port of hodeidah damaged, the red cross brings medical aid, including insulin, into yemen with occasional cargo planes to sanaa. other goods come by land convoys from jordan and oman and by ship from jordan, oman and dubai.  a ship from karachi with 500 metric tonnes of rice is now due on oct 7 in hodeidah, the first icrc shipment there since early february. faite called on all sides to open sanaa airport to commercial flights for essential aid supplies and to make progress toward allowing the red cross to visit prisoners of war.     i don t think political settlement is coming soon and i m very worried that the extension of the conflict would lead to more problems,  faite said.  this is why humanitarian aid, access of essential goods should be there,  he said.  there is a bottleneck . although the death rate for cholera victims has dropped to less than 0.3 percent, faite said yemen s  health sector is really on its knees in yemen ... the health staff is on its knees as well because they are not paid.  for the first time, the red cross is now providing health workers with food parcels, he said.  in terms of access to even water, electricity, there isn t a power grid in the main cities in yemen. without the icrc and other organizations fixing (pumping stations) there wouldn t be any running water in sanaa,  he said.

" the republican national committee asked the charity of democratic nominee hillary clinton’s family on monday to produce all correspondence its staff had with the u.s. state department while clinton served as america’s most senior diplomat.  clinton’s campaign to win the nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism that donors to the clinton foundation may have expected special favors from the u.s. government in return. she says donors to the global charity receive no preferential treatment.     “the clinton foundation can play a vital role in filling important gaps in the public record by demonstrating its commitment to transparency and making public all correspondence its officials had with the state department during secretary clinton’s tenure,” reince priebus, the rnc chairman, said in a letter to the foundation’s president, donna shalala.  the rnc provided a copy of the letter to reporters.      spokesmen for clinton and the foundation, which is known for its work to widen access to hiv medicines in developing countries, did not respond to a request for comment. some emails have already emerged that show clinton foundation officials seeking meetings with clinton and other diplomats on behalf of supporters who have made large donations to the foundation.  foundation officials also sought other favors, including help with visa issues or urging the government to hire certain people, emails show. spokesmen for clinton have noted that in several cases the requests from foundation officials were unsuccessful. thousands more emails from clinton’s tenure are still in the process of being released as public records. their release was delayed in part because of clinton’s decision to use an unauthorized private email server for her work without informing record keeping officials.  in his letter, priebus said the foundation’s own records have “the unique ability” to establish whether donors received special treatment.     clinton promised president barack obama that her family’s charities would annually disclose all their donors and seek prior approval from the state department for any additional money given by foreign governments when obama made her his most senior diplomat in 2009. the charities said last year they failed to comply with the promises, blaming oversights. the foundation has said it will no longer accept foreign or corporate funding for at least some of its work if clinton is elected. her daughter, chelsea clinton, will remain on the board.

" the u.s. supreme court on tuesday formally dropped plans to hear the last remaining challenge to an earlier version of president donald trump’s travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries and a ban on refugees, but a fight over the legality of his latest restrictions still could reach the nine justices. the high court said it will not hear the case brought by hawaii over the bans, which have expired and been replaced with revised policies. trump’s 120 day ban on refugees ended on tuesday and is set to be replaced by a new set of restrictions. two lower courts have blocked trump’s new ban targeting people from eight countries, trump’s third set of travel restrictions, and the issue could find its way back to the supreme court on appeal. the court on oct. 10 disposed of the first of two travel ban cases — brought by the american civil liberties union and others in maryland — after trump’s earlier 90 day ban on people entering the u.s. from six predominantly muslim countries expired on sept. 24. it was a replaced with a modified, open ended ban involving eight countries. the justices had been scheduled to hear arguments in the two consolidated on oct. 10. among the issues raised by challengers was whether the travel ban discriminated against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. the same arguments are being used against the new ban. trump has said the restrictions were needed to prevent terrorism in the united states. the expired ban had targeted people from iran, libya, syria, yemen, somalia and sudan. the new ban removed sudan from the list and blocked people from chad and north korea and certain government officials from venezuela from entering the united states. if the new restrictions go into effect, they could block tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the united states. trump had promised as a candidate “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” ",0

" a number of u.s. cities are introducing proposals to mandate community oversight of police use of digital surveillance technology as evidence mounts that black or poor neighborhoods are being more heavily scrutinized than others, civil rights activists said on wednesday. the legislative measures are being introduced by lawmakers in 11 cities from seattle to washington, d.c., and are backed by a coalition of 17 groups led by the american civil liberties union and the national association for the advancement of colored people. “(we need) to build the legislative power of local communities to prevent high tech racial profiling and policing from turning our neighborhoods into open air prisons,” malkia cyril, executive director of the center for media justice, told reporters on a conference call during which the proposals were announced on wednesday. the coalition said the proposals stemmed from the growing use by departments across the country of high tech equipment or software, some of which was developed for battlefields, to surreptitiously monitor poor or predominately black neighborhoods, muslims, or the street level movements of activists within the black lives matter movement. the proposed bills would mandate city council approval of the use and purchase of surveillance equipment, and input and oversight from communities on how it is used. “we want to give municipalities the ability to say ‘no,’” cyril said.  proposals were introduced on wednesday in miami beach and pensacola, florida, and others were expected in the coming weeks in new york city, milwaukee, muskegon, michigan, and other localities, the american civil liberties union (aclu) said. palo alto, california, will vote on its proposal later in september, and hattiesburg, mississippi, is introducing legislation in october, the aclu said. police departments across the united states are facing intense scrutiny over the use of excessive force especially against black people, accountability and accusations of racial bias. police officials have said digital surveillance tools are needed for crime prevention and pointed to reduced crime in some areas where they are used. the coalition said blacks have been disproportionately targeted by automatic license plate readers in oakland, california, closed circuit television surveillance in lansing, michigan, a ‘stingray’ that mimics cell phone towers to track a phone user’s location in baltimore, maryland, and social media monitoring software.",0

" former utah republican governor jon huntsman has accepted president donald trump’s offer to be ambassador to russia, an administration official said on wednesday. the job, which requires senate confirmation, would put huntsman in moscow at a time when u.s. russian ties have sunk to a post cold war low. huntsman served as ambassador to china under democratic president barack obama before launching an unsuccessful bid for the 2012 republican presidential nomination. trump has said he wants to improve relations with russian president vladimir putin, which deteriorated under obama over issues including russia’s annexation of ukraine’s crimea and the two countries’ backing of opposing sides in the syrian civil war. the tensions peaked in december when obama expelled 35 russian suspected spies after u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the 2016 election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump’s favor. the kremlin has denied the allegations.

" the united arab emirates, criticized globally for its treatment of migrant workers, issued a law on tuesday to combat abuse of domestic staff, state news agency wam said. it includes prohibitions on sexual harassment, forced labor, and the employment of domestic workers under 18. it also stipulates that workers are entitled to one paid day off each week, 30 days of paid vacation per year and up to 30 days of sick leave. president sheikh khalifa bin zayed al nahyan approved the law, which was praised by human rights organizations when its draft was passed by the country s legislative body in may. the uae relies heavily on migrant labor with an estimated 8 million workers making up more than 80 percent of its population, according to the international labour organization. many  domestic workers come from southeast asia. the gulf arab state has in the past been sharply criticized by groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch for allowing domestic staff to endure long hours, unpaid wages and abuse. the new law covers 19 service work occupations, including guards, parking valet workers, gardeners, domestic workers, cooks, and nannies, as well as private trainers, nurses, and drivers.     it is set to take effect two months after its publication in the official gazette. while welcoming the legal change, rights organizations have voiced concerns about its enforcement and implementation   like how labor inspections will be conducted. another area of concern is the  kafala  or sponsorship system, which forces foreign workers to seek their employer s consent to change jobs or leave the country, appears set to remain in place.

" u.s. president donald trump used his barnstorming strategy on wednesday to try to build momentum for his first legislative initiative, a healthcare overhaul, by holding a massive rally in nashville, tennessee, reminiscent of his campaign events. back on capitol hill, republican leaders negotiated behind closed doors, held media conferences and gave cable news interviews as they tried to push forward their plan to dismantle the affordable care act, commonly called obamacare. after republican house speaker paul ryan unveiled the new plan last week, fault lines appeared within the party as some conservatives said it did not go far enough and others rejected it entirely.  trump used campaign like language in his wednesday night speech, pledging “to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous obamacare.” speaking to reporters aboard presidential plane air force one after the rally, trump expressed optimism about his plan’s chances in congress.  “we’re going to come up with something. we always do,” he said. republicans control both congress and the white house for the first time in a decade, but the overhaul still faces political battles to be fought by a president new to governing. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters before the rally the trump administration had been in talks with ryan and congressional leaders and was flooding the media with interviews with administration officials to help advance the plan. ryan, the top republican in the house of representatives, also continued to champion the legislation, saying on cable news he was open to making “improvements and refinements,” but also adding “the major components are staying intact.” he told a news conference later in the evening the house would hold votes on repealing and replacing obamacare but refused to provide a timetable. two house committees approved the bill’s provisions with no changes last week. the budget committee will try on thursday to unify the plan into a single bill for consideration on the house floor. republicans cannot afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass. three committee republicans are members of the hardline conservative house freedom caucus. signs emerged on wednesday that the white house was winning over reluctant conservatives who initially questioned the legislation on the grounds that it too closely resembled obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of former president barack obama. the administration indicated it was open to revisiting the plan’s treatment of medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, during a meeting with a conservative wing of the party. specifically, conservatives want obamacare’s expansion of medicaid to end sooner than proposed in the ryan plan, and want to introduce medicaid work requirements for able bodied adults without children. state governments run medicaid with reimbursements from the federal government. obamacare expanded its eligibility and increased funding for it, which enabled about 10 million previously uninsured americans to obtain medical insurance.  vice president mike pence advocated for the plan earlier on wednesday behind closed doors with the republican study committee, a large group of house conservatives. republican representative phil roe said after the pence meeting the bill would probably be changed to move up the end of the medicaid expansion by one year, to 2019. the conservative group’s members were “very close to signing off” on the legislation, its leader, representative mark walker, told reporters. speaking on cnn, ryan mentioned “giving states better chances at more flexibility with medicaid,” but provided no details. just as the party’s conservatives began expressing optimism about the proposal’s fortunes, republican moderates raised concerns that tax credits currently in the bill intended to help people buy health insurance were not sufficient. representative charlie dent, following a meeting of moderate republicans with pence, told reporters that speeding up the termination of the medicaid expansion was a “non starter.” senate republicans have also voiced rising unease. “as written, the house bill would not pass the senate. but i believe we can fix it,” senator ted cruz told reporters. republican senator lindsey graham told nbc’s “today” show: “it is mortally wounded.” the conservative advocacy group freedomworks held a rally amid snow flurries and a frigid wind outside the capitol, where several house and senate republicans, including cruz and senator rand paul, voiced dissatisfaction with the bill. paul later told reporters: “the white house has been much more open to negotiation on this” than house leaders.  a libertarian, paul posted an op ed on the breitbart news website later on wednesday calling ryan’s plan “obamacare lite” and suggesting smashing it to “smithereens.” the u.s. department of health and human services released data showing enrollment in the individual insurance plans created under obamacare has declined to 12.2 million americans. enrollment in these individual insurance plans was down by about 500,000 people from 2016 by the end of january, it said. it is about 1.6 million people short of obama’s goal for 2017 sign ups, the government said.

" neither of peru s two vice presidents would open the door to new elections by resigning if president pedro pablo kuczynski was forced from office, second vice president mercedes araoz told reuters late on sunday. araoz said she was confident kuczynski was innocent of wrongdoing regarding recently disclosed links he once had with odebrecht, a brazilian construction company at the center of latin america s biggest graft scandal. if kuczynski is as expected unseated by the opposition run congress in a vote on thursday, first vice president martin vizcarra would immediately replace him.  new national elections would only be called if both vizcarra   a former governor of a copper rich mining region and peru s current ambassador to canada   and araoz resigned or left office before the scheduled end of kuczynski s term in 2021. but araoz ruled out that scenario.  we re going to ensure that this government continues in power. peru elected the three of us and both of us vice presidents are going to defend our mandate,  araoz said in a brief phone interview. araoz  remarks were the first explicit assurance by kuczynski s center right government that it would not abandon the presidency, and will likely soothe investor fears about the prospect of elections that could sweep anti establishment candidates to power as the graft scandal roils the country. odebrecht has sent shockwaves through latin american politics since admitting a year ago that it had won lucrative public work contracts in peru and nine countries in the region through a network of bribes and kickback schemes. the scandal has landed elites in jail from colombia to the dominican republic, but has hit particularly hard in peru, where odebrecht once had an outsized presence. with kuczynski, a 79 year old former wall street banker, and two former presidents engulfed in the scandal and several opposition leaders under investigation, a majority of peruvians want kuczynski and lawmakers in congress to leave office and prefer new elections to be called, a poll by ipsos showed on sunday. but araoz said that would risk derailing progress peru has made since its return to democracy at the turn of the century.  we want our economy to keep growing, we want to maintain democracy, we want to avoid dictatorial actions,  araoz said in a veiled swipe at the opposition. congress is controlled by a right wing opposition party headed by media shy keiko fujimori, the daughter of former authoritarian leader alberto fujimori, who is in prison for graft and human rights violations. over the past year, fujimori s foes have alleged that her party would use its majority in congress to unseat kuczynski in retribution for unexpectedly defeating her in the 2016 election   warnings that kuczynski was now seizing on.  there s an attack on democratic order,  kuczynski said late on sunday in a televised interview with a group of local journalists.  we have to defend democracy because it s the only tool that guarantees us a path to prosperity... i implore all to continue our trajectory.  fujimori s surrogates have denied she has sought to unseat kuczynski for political reasons and describe a motion passed on friday to start  presidential vacancy  proceedings as part of her party s fight against corruption. kuczynski once denied having any links to odebrecht.  but last week odebrecht sent congress a requested report that detailed $4.8 million in deposits it made over a decade long period starting in 2004 to companies owned by kuczynski or a close business associate of his. the payments include about $600,000 in financial services kuczynski provided for an odebrecht project as a private citizen and about $800,000 transferred to a company owned by him during and shortly after holding senior government posts. kuczynski apologized to peruvians for not having explained his links to odebrecht properly. he denied taking bribes or anything improper about the business transactions.  i m absolutely sure. there was no corruption here,  kuczynski said.

" pope francis issued a stinging new critique of the vatican s top administration on thursday, saying  traitors  stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning egypt s  sphinx  with a toothbrush . for the fourth year running, francis used his annual christmas greetings to the roman catholic church s central bureaucracy, or curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change.  reforming rome is like cleaning the sphinx of egypt with a toothbrush,  he said, quoting a 19th century belgian churchman. the phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed clementina hall of the vatican s apostolic palace. since his election as the first latin american pope in 2013, francis has been trying to reform the italian dominated curia to bring the church s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former pope benedict. but he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined.        francis said some in the bureaucracy   the nerve center of the 1.2 billion member church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope s decisions   were part of  cliques and plots . francis called this  unbalanced and degenerate  and a  cancer that leads to a self referential attitude . in his address on thursday, he spoke of those  traitors of trust  who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but  let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory.  when they are quietly let go, he said,  they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a  mea culpa  (latin for  my fault ). francis did not cite any specific examples. last june the vatican s first auditor general resigned suddenly. he later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the vatican said he had been spying on his superiors. earlier this month, the vatican bank s deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained. in july, in a major shake up of the vatican administration, francis replaced catholicism s top theologian, a conservative german cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff s vision of a more inclusive church. francis said the overwhelming majority of curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly. later, in a separate meeting with lay vatican employees and their families, francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some church officials.  he spoke hours before the funeral of cardinal bernard law, the ex archbishop of boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the catholic church.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday current policy regarding transgender personnel serving in the military would remain in place until he advises president donald trump on how to implement his directive on a transgender ban. mattis said in a statement he would set up a panel of experts serving in the departments of defense and homeland security to provide recommendations on implementing the ban. he said he would advise the president after the panel reports it recommendations, and “in the interim, current policy with respect to currently serving members will remain in place.” trump signed a memorandum on friday directing the u.s. military not to accept transgender men and women as recruits and halting the use of government funds for sex reassignment surgeries for active personnel unless the process is already under way. a white house official who briefed reporters about the memo on friday declined to specify whether transgender men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. the memo called on mattis to submit a plan to trump by feb. 21, on how to implement the changes. mattis said he expects to issue other guidance “including any necessary interim adjustments to procedures, to ensure the continued combat readiness of the force until our final policy on this subject is issued.” trump’s directive created uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. the decision appealed to some in trump’s conservative political base while drawing criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) rights. civil rights groups filed two new lawsuits on monday challenging trump’s ban.

" prime minister rami al hamdallah chaired the first meeting of the palestinian cabinet in the gaza strip for three years on tuesday, in a move toward reconciliation between the mainstream fatah party and islamist group hamas. hamas seized gaza in 2007 in fighting with fatah forces loyal to president mahmoud abbas and has ruled the impoverished desert enclave of two million people since.  the cabinet session was the first in gaza since 2014, hamdallah told ministers, and a major step in a reconciliation process promoted by neighboring egypt and other u.s. allied arab countries.  today, we stand before an important historical moment as we begin to get over our wounds, put our differences aside and place the higher national interest above all else,  hamdallah said.  hamas chief ismail haniyeh echoed the optimism, saying:  there might be some difficulties on the road, but we will conclude reconciliation, regardless of the cost.  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned the  palestinians against engaging in  bogus reconciliations  and he referred to iranian funding for hamas, which has fought three wars with israel since 2008. in a statement, netanyahu said any palestinian administration should  recognize the state of israel, disband the hamas military arm, (and) sever the connection with iran .  hamas, considered a terrorist group by israel and the west, last month disbanded its gaza shadow government after egypt, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates clamped an economic boycott on its main donor, qatar. but while hamas has handed over administrative responsibilities to a unity government originally formed three years ago, its armed wing remains the dominant force in gaza. a first sign of discontent surfaced on tuesday with hamas criticizing abbas s decision to await the outcome of talks fatah plans to hold with the group on oct. 10 before lifting sanctions he has imposed on gaza.  the government has assumed its responsibilities in gaza and therefore delay is not justified,  hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum said.  there is no excuse for delaying or undermining measures that would ease the suffering of gaza s people.  abbas halted payments for israeli supplied electricity to the enclave in june, a step that has led to long daily blackouts, and cut salaries for gaza civil servants. abbas told egyptian tv station cbc on monday there could be only  one state, one regime, one law and one weapon  in gaza, reiterating a long held position that security should be in the hands of only the palestinian authority (pa), which he heads, and that the pa must control border crossing points. in a pre recorded address to the palestinian cabinet,   egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi urged unity.  i assure you we have no time to waste, and that history will hold accountable those who waste the current opportunity to bring about peace,  sisi said.  both israel and egypt   whose intelligence chief arrived in gaza to meet hamas leaders, hamdallah and officials from other palestinian factions   maintain a partial blockade of gaza, citing security concerns. israeli palestinian talks have been frozen since 2014 over issues such as fatah hamas reconciliation and israeli settlement building in occupied territory. visiting the jewish settlement of maale adumim in the occupied west bank on tuesday, netanyahu said  thousands of housing units  would be added to the community of 40,000 people near jerusalem. he gave no timeframe. israel has built about 120 settlements in the west bank. about 350,000 settlers live there and a further 200,000 in east jerusalem, among about 2.6 million palestinians. most countries consider the settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace as they take up territory palestinians need for a viable state. israel disagrees, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land and security interests.

" hondurans spilled into the streets of the capital on monday night, banging pots and pans and joining rebel police in defiance of a curfew imposed after a presidential election that was heavily criticized by the organization of american states. some police officers abandoned their posts and joined carnival like demonstrations that erupted across the city hours after night fell and the curfew was supposed to have begun.   a statement issued in the name of the national police said the officers were upset with the government over a political crisis that was not their responsibility.  our people are sovereign,  said a member of the elite cobra riot police, reading the statement.  we cannot confront and repress their rights.  authorities finished counting votes on monday after a week of increasingly widespread criticism about the nov. 26 election, with organization of american states (oas) lending credence to opposition claims the government manipulated the results to ensure a win.   the tight margin, along with the irregularities, errors and systematic problems that have surrounded this election, does not allow the mission to be certain about the results,  said former bolivian president jorge quiroga, heading the oas election observation mission in the central american country. electoral authorities said president juan orlando hernandez won 42.98 percent of the vote, compared with opposition challenger salvador nasralla s 41.39 percent, based on 99.96 percent of ballot boxes tallied. however, authorities refrained from declaring a winner, with nasralla s center left opposition alliance demanding a wide recount of nearly a third of votes, a request backed by the oas and european union election observers.  lending more support to that view, a leader of rebellious cobra riot police told reporters the country wanted a vote by vote recount to clarify the results, and called on the armed forces to come out in support of the police protest.  the alliance, which claims that results sheets from ballot boxes were altered, is expected to formally contest the results.  president hernandez, who has been praised by the united states for his crackdown on street gangs, also refrained from calling himself the winner on monday, despite claiming victory several times since the election.    i make a call for peace, for brotherhood, for sanity, for national unity,  he told reporters. in a striking sign of support for hernandez, 49, the u.s. state department cleared the way for honduras to receive millions of dollars in u.s. aid two days after the election, certifying that the government has been fighting corruption and upholding human rights, a document seen by reuters showed. the government was struggling to contain the fallout from the chaos on monday evening.  even former tv star nasralla joined a crowd of boisterous supporters, jumping up and down in a tan suit while flashing peace signs and joining a chant of  the dictatorship will fall,  a video posted on twitter showed.  the additional powers granted to the army and police including the nighttime curfew from friday were intended to stem the protests and have led to more than a thousand arrests. up to 12 people have been killed in the protests or during the curfew. tens of thousands peacefully took to the streets on sunday in a show of force for the opposition. the police revolt began when more than 200 members of the cobras refused to carry on battling protesters, saying it was tantamount to taking sides. nasralla has repeatedly called on the security forces to ignore orders.  we are rebelling,  said one of the policemen, who covered his face in a ski mask and declined to give his name.  we call on all the police nationally to act with their conscience.  they soon had the support of other units, with reports that their protests had spread to other cities.  the police also said they were angry about the death of two colleagues shot while they were enforcing the curfew on sunday night, an attack a spokesman said was unrelated to the election protests. two civilian protesters were killed in the capital overnight, their relatives said, although authorities did not confirm the deaths. the oas called for peaceful protests, said politicians must not incite violence and that security forces must respect human rights. last week, at least three people were killed as soldiers broke up protesters  blockades. one police source and local reports said five more had been shot dead in the north of the country on friday. the deaths have not been confirmed by authorities.  early last week, nasralla, a 64 year old former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory, gaining a five point lead with more than half of the ballots tallied. the counting process suddenly halted for more than a day and began leaning in favor of hernandez after resuming.  opposition leaders on monday showed a sample of their own records of polling that did not match with the tribunal s. venezuelan president nicolas maduro accused the united states of backing vote fraud in honduras, while the u.s. embassy on monday called for a  transparent, impartial, and opportune election result.  honduras struggles with violent drug gangs, one of world s highest murder rates and endemic poverty, driving a tide of its people to migrate to

" a un settlement program, un habitat in myanmar, on thursday rejected a state media report that it had agreed to help build housing for people fleeing violence in the northern myanmar state of rakhine, where an army operation has displaced hundreds of thousands. the development underscores tension between myanmar and the united nations, which in april criticized the government s previous plan to resettle rohingya muslims displaced by last year s violence in  camp like  villages. more than 600,000 have crossed to bangladesh since aug. 25 attacks by rohingya militants sparked an army crackdown. the united nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic rakhine buddhist mobs since then amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the rohingya.         the state run global new light of myanmar newspaper said on thursday that un habitat had agreed to provide technical assistance in housing displaced people in rakhine and the agency would work closely with the authorities to  implement the projects to be favorable to myanmar s social culture and administrative system .  but stanislav saling, spokesman for the office of the u.n. resident coordinator in myanmar, told reuters in an email that  no agreements were reached so far  after the agency s representatives attended a series of meetings with myanmar officials this week in its capital naypyitaw.   the un habitat mission emphasized that resettlement should be conducted in accordance with the principles of housing and property restitution for refugees and displaced persons to support their safe and dignified return to their places of origin,  he said, responding on behalf of un habitat. un habitat welcomed the interest of the myanmar government in international norms and standards, he added.  the united nations  principles state that all refugees or displaced persons have the right to return to property or land from which they were arbitrarily or unlawfully removed.  myanmar leader aung san suu kyi has pledged that anyone sheltering in bangladesh who can prove they were myanmar residents can return, but it remains unclear whether those refugees would be allowed to return to their homes.  rohingya who return to myanmar are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to myanmar officials and plans seen by reuters. buddhist majority myanmar in august suggested that un agencies such as the world food program have provided food to rohingya insurgents, adding to pressure on aid groups which had to suspend activities in rakhine and pull out most of their staff.  still, soe aung, permanent secretary at the ministry of social welfare who attended the meetings with un habitat,  insisted that the agency had agreed to give assistance and the two sides will meet again on november 8.   we have reached an agreement with the un for technical assistance. we will discuss more details on how to proceed,  he told reuters.  the myanmar military said on thursday that it will withdraw  some  of the security forces carrying out clearance operations in northern rakhine and dispatch them to the state capital, sittwe, as an auxiliary force. thousands of refugees have continued to arrive cross the naf river separating rakhine and bangladesh in recent days, even though myanmar says military operations ceased on sept. 5.

" u.s. president donald trump s policies in the gulf are dangerous and misguided, iran s foreign minister said on thursday, adding that pressure from washington had only succeeded in strengthening tehran s resolve. speaking at a conference in rome, foreign minister mohammad javad zarif criticized trump for seeking to renegotiate a 2015 deal aimed at curbing iran s nuclear program. he also questioned the u.s. response to a crisis between qatar and its neighbors.  we have problems with the policies that are coming from washington and i believe those policies are extremely dangerous, impulsive, not grounded in reality,  zarif said.  generally a revision, or a reorientation, or a cognitive adjustment to our region is highly necessary in washington.   he said trump did not understand the nature of the nuclear accord and was trying to dissuade foreign investors from doing business in iran.  in spite of the arm twisting, more and more european companies have been coming in,  he said. zarif led iran s negotiating team for the nuclear deal and faced criticism from hardliners at home over the terms of the accord. he said this dissent had faded over the past year.  the united states  pressure has in fact created more solidarity inside iran. i am being attacked much less in iran today than i was before trump was elected. so i thank him for that,  zarif said. trump said in october he would not certify that tehran was complying with the 2015 deal and warned he might ultimately terminate it, accusing iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the accord. other signatories of the agreement   britain, france, germany, russia, china and the european union   have said they believe iran is living up to its commitments.

" u.s. president elect donald trump has often boasted about the strict confidentiality pledges he exacts from his employees.  now a legal challenge to one of those agreements is pending before a u.s. agency over which he will soon have influence, potentially posing an early test of concerns about conflicts of interest between trump’s public role and his business empire. in september, a worker advocacy group filed a charge with the national labor relations board (nlrb) claiming a nondisclosure contract used by trump is unlawfully broad. the contract prohibits employees, independent contractors and even volunteers from ever disclosing any information that trump deems confidential about his personal, business or political life. the nlrb has said that sweeping or unclear contracts inhibit workers from discussing working conditions or speaking to union organizers.  the five member nlrb currently has two vacancies that trump is slated to fill early in his term, likely tipping what has been a liberal leaning agency under president barack obama to a more business friendly posture. if the nlrb rules against trump, it could free up workers to be more vocal about their concerns and strengthen their bargaining power. in addition to the confidentiality case, there are about 10 other trump related cases pending at the nlrb. the cases involve alleged labor violations at the trump international hotel las vegas, where management has refused to bargain with the culinary workers union. it was not clear if the confidentiality contract was intended for workers on trump’s election campaign or employees in his businesses, and reuters could not independently verify its authenticity. representatives of the trump organization did not respond to requests for comment. the case is at a very early stage and could be settled or dismissed before reaching a full hearing before the five member nlrb. the board’s decisions may be appealed in a federal court. the nlrb is comprised of three members from the sitting president’s party and two from the opposing party, a system that typically results in wide policy shifts between administrations. in addition to the current two vacancies, another will arise when a current member’s term expires next december.  under the obama administration, the nlrb has struck down  confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from organizing at t mobile usa inc, quicken loans, directtv and a number of other companies.  government ethics experts and labor lawyers said that if trump’s handpicked nlrb members uphold the contract, it could suggest favoritism.  “there is an appearance of bias and political pressure that could undermine the legitimacy of the agency,” said richard painter, a professor at the university of minnesota law school who was the chief white house ethics lawyer under republican president george w. bush. the nlrb cases represent one of several areas where concerns may arise over potential conflicts of interest raised by trump’s new role and his sprawling business interests. trump last week said he would allow his children to run his businesses while maintaining his ownership interest via a “blind trust.” if the current cases are ruled upon by the nlrb, one possible solution to the potential conflict could be for trump appointees to recuse themselves from cases involving his business organization, said a former nlrb chairman, william gould.  gould said that during his tenure at the agency, in the mid 1990s, members recused themselves from cases that raised any chance of a conflict. gould, who is now a professor at stanford law school, said he disqualified himself from cases involving a union of which his son was a member. several experts, however, said recusal would not be legally required unless trump’s appointees represented him or his companies in the past or were otherwise involved in his business. the challenge to trump’s confidentiality agreement was filed by david rosenfeld, a california labor lawyer, on behalf of the committee to preserve the religious right to organize, a worker advocacy group that he created.  reuters reviewed a copy of the employment agreement that rosenfeld filed with his complaint, which targeted both the trump organization and the trump campaign. rosenfeld said he copied it from the campaign website, but that the agreement was no longer posted there.  it was not clear how many employees signed this version of the agreement, and reuters was unable to find a copy on the website. the agreement prohibits disclosure of details about trump’s “personal life, political affairs and/or business affairs,” as well as anything “mr. trump insists remain private or confidential.” it forbids employees from publicly disparaging trump and his wife, children, grandchildren, siblings and other relatives. confidentiality agreements are common, but labor law experts said they can be unlawful if they are too broad or don’t specify what types of information will be deemed confidential.  trump defended a similar confidentiality agreement in a case earlier this year involving a former campaign aide, whom trump accused of giving information about other staffers to reporters. in a statement, the trump campaign said confidentiality agreements were “standard practice” for entities that need to safeguard sensitive information. the case settled for undisclosed terms.

" the white house, responding to hearings on capitol hill about contacts between officials in donald trump’s presidential campaign and russia, said on tuesday there was no evidence of collusion between trump’s team and moscow. testifying before a house panel, former cia director john brennan said he was aware of contacts between russian officials and people involved in the trump campaign and grew concerned that moscow had sought to lure americans down “a treasonous path.” dan coats, the director of national intelligence, was questioned in separate testimony before a senate panel over a report in the washington post that trump asked coats to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of collusion. coats sidestepped the question but said he has made clear to trump’s administration that “any political shaping” of intelligence would be inappropriate. in a statement to reporters, a white house official said the hearings showed “there is still no evidence of any russia trump campaign collusion.” trump, who is in rome on his first overseas trip as president, has been embroiled in controversy since his firing earlier this month of federal bureau of investigation director james comey amid the agency’s investigation into possible ties between the trump campaign and russian officials.

" donald trump hasn’t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  a lawyer for the new york real estate developer demanded on wednesday the new york times retract a story in which two women accused trump of inappropriately touching them. if the newspaper did not comply, trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would “pursue all available actions and remedies,” the lawyer, marc kasowitz, said in a letter.  trump said at a rally on thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  an attorney for the times, david mccraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would “welcome the opportunity” to defend it in court. over the years, media outlets including the wall street journal, the village voice, the new york post and fortune magazine have reported receiving similar threats from trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. however, trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service westlaw, a unit of thomson reuters.       the last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. trump filed the case after the chicago tribune’s architecture critic called his proposed 150 story manhattan skyscraper an “atrocious, ugly monstrosity.” in 1985, a federal judge in manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a first amendment right to express his opinion. the skyscraper was never built. in the 32 years since trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. he was successful in one of those cases.  book author and former new york times reporter timothy o’brien defeated a trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after trump underwent a grueling deposition by o’brien’s lawyers.  trump’s suit against o’brien, which also named o’brien’s publisher, time warner book group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman’s net worth. a new jersey state judge found in 2009 that trump had not established o’brien’s actual malice.     former miss universe contestant sheena monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as “rigged.” the arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in manhattan in 2013. the court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014.     the same year, a san diego federal judge ruled tarla makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against trump university, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the better business bureau that trump university engaged in fraudulent business practices. the judge, gonzalo curiel, dismissed trump’s defamation claim.     trump’s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the reuters docket search may have missed.     u.s. courts have routinely deemed trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. that means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in “reckless disregard” for the truth. if trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. the new york times attorney, david mccraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. any trump claim will be difficult because trump’s accusers were on the record, said jane kirtley, a media law expert at university of minnesota law school. that would bolster the newspaper’s argument that it didn’t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. trump has vowed to “open up our libel laws,” if he wins the presidency on nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. in reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. court records show that trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a trump casino in indiana, were dismissed. one defamation suit against trump survived dismissal, however. stock analyst marvin roffman sued trump for $2 million in federal court in philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the taj mahal casino in atlantic city. roffman alleged trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. after a federal judge refused to toss the case, the trump organization settled in 1991. an attorney for roffman declined to comment.

" washington state’s attorney general has promised to uncover “what truly motivated” president donald trump’s executive order on immigration, an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a u.s. president makes national security decisions.  the presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries, but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by washington state.  on thursday, the u.s. court of appeals for the 9th circuit left the judge’s ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either side’s arguments. in its decision, the 9th circuit cited a previous case establishing that “circumstantial evidence of intent, including … statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.”  the trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion.  washington attorney general bob ferguson signaled on sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against muslims or islam. he also said he would also move to depose administration officials. legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters.  “the idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president,” said john yoo, a former justice department lawyer in the george w. bush administration.      “it would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does,” said yoo, now a professor at the university of california at berkeley school of law.  trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in washington for his decision and a top white house aide on sunday accused the 9th circuit of a “judicial usurpation of power.”  “the president’s powers here are beyond question,” senior policy adviser stephen miller told fox news sunday. u.s. courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws, in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. but on questions of racial or religious discrimination, they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined.  in 1993, for instance, the supreme court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in hialeah, florida, though neutral on its face, was actually intended to discriminate against a santeria church, which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite. stephen griffin, a professor of constitutional law at tulane university, said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of trump’s executive order. “motive is relevant,” he said.  one question in the current case is likely to be which, if any, of trump’s statements should be admissible in examining the administration’s motives in issuing the order.  “if you’re allowed to use evidence from the campaign, the state’s case is very strong,” said  griffin. in december, 2015, days after a mass attack by an islamic state sympathizers in san bernardino, california, trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our representatives can figure out what is going on.” he later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism. stanford university law school professor michael mcconnell, a former federal appeals judge, said the court should not consider campaign statements, because trump only swore an oath to uphold the constitution after he became president.  in its complaint, washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the christian broadcasting network, saying he would prioritize christians in the middle east for admission as refugees.   legal experts are divided on whether the state’s lawyers should be allowed to question the president’s advisers – and possibly even the president – in depositions. the white house could potentially claim executive privilege, which protects the president and other officials from subpoena, said thomas lee, an expert in constitutional law at fordham university.  anna rose mathieson a partner with the california appellate law group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani, who told fox news the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a muslim ban legal. david pressman, a partner at boies schiller flexner and former assistant secretary of homeland security in the obama administration, said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice. “you don’t want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy,” said pressman. though in this case, pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear, opening the door to further questioning. the next steps in the case are not certain.  the trump administration has said it is considering appealing the 9th circuit ruling to the supreme court, and the 9th circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges. the president has also said he might replace the order with “a brand new” one, which could end the current legal action.

"court documents related to tina johnson, an alabama woman who claims that republican senatorial candidate roy moore groped her in his office decades ago, may raise questions about johnson s motives in making the accusation.the documents, reviewed by breitbart news, show that moore represented johnson s mother in a nasty custody case for johnson s then 12-year-old son, daniel sitz. in the case, johnson was repeatedly painted by moore s client as an unfit, absent, and unstable mother and was accused of taking her son from his elementary school against his will. johnson s mother was ultimately awarded custody in the case.one affidavit signed by johnson s mother while she was represented by moore accused johnson of having a  violent nature  and noted that she  has been treated by a psychiatrist when she was approximately 15 years of age.  johnson was a teenage mother.separate criminal documents show that, as late as 2010, johnson was arrested and pled guilty to felony fraud charges related to checks belonging to a family member. she also entered a court drug program.speaking to al.com, johnson first went public with the claim that moore groped her when she was  on legal business with her mother  in 1991. the website noted that  johnson reached out to al.com  to discuss her alleged experience with moore.the website related that johnson was  at the office to sign over custody of her 12-year-old son to her mother, with whom he d been living. johnson claimed that, after the two met with moore, her mother walked out of the office door first and that, as johnson was walking out, moore grabbed her buttocks from behind.  he didn t pinch it; he grabbed it,  she claims.watch, as tina johnson tells cnn s erin burnett the  details  of her alleged sexual assault by judge roy moore. it s curious that a woman with johnson s background vs. the squeaky clean background of judge roy moore would attempt to prove that her faith was stronger, or more somehow more relevant than roy moore s faith. a document, signed by moore, stated that cofield   and not johnson   was the  most fit and proper person  to have custody of daniel sitz.johnson s son had resided with his grandmother, cofield, since he was nine months old. cofield says that, during those years, she provided daniel with food, clothing, and shelter  without any assistance  from johnson. a judge officially granted cofield full custody on september 23, 1991.last week, breitbart news interviewed delbra adams, moore s former longtime secretary and judicial assistant. adams said that, in her 13 years of working for moore, she never saw or experienced any inappropriate conduct toward women.adams worked for moore in 1991 at the time of johnson s accusations. adams s desk was right outside his office door at the time. adams  name was signed as a notary on one of the custody documents filed in johnson s case on behalf of johnson s mother, cofield.   breitbart news",1

" the u.s. federal bureau of investigation hinted on wednesday that authorities in iran had recently been trying to help locate robert levinson, a retired fbi agent who disappeared exactly nine years ago after traveling to an iranian resort island to meet a fugitive from u.s. justice. “we are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of iran and the united states, and believe that our ability to locate bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the iranian government,” the fbi’s washington field office said in a prepared statement. the statement quoted fbi director james comey saying that his agency was “doing everything in our power to investigate all leads.”  the fbi statement did not elaborate further. the white house also said that finding levinson “remains a top priority for the united states,” but added that the u.s. would “continue to call upon the islamic republic of iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year.” five americans were released by iran in january to coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions in return for curbs on tehran’s nuclear program. the white house offered clemency to seven iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the united states. levinson’s family continued to urge the u.s. government to press iran for his release. in a statement, levinson’s wife, christine, said: “we need the united states government and the country of iran to work together to resolve what happened to bob and return him safely to his family.” levinson disappeared after flying from dubai to kish island in the gulf in march 2007. there he met with daoud salahuddin, an american islamic militant who fled to iran while facing charges in the murder of an iranian embassy official based in washington. levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work. months after he disappeared, u.s. government sources acknowledged that levinson also maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the central intelligence agency. a handful of cia officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation. the iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in levinson’s abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was “in the hands of iranian security forces.” some fbi investigators strongly believe levinson is still alive, while officials at other u.s. agencies believe he died some time ago.

" unions in the united states face sweeping changes to labor law and regulations under a new republican administration that is expected to tilt policy toward employers.     republicans will take control of the presidency and both chambers of congress in tuesday’s elections, after unions failed to deliver key industrial states to democratic candidate hillary clinton. clinton’s loss could have wide ranging consequences for unions. donald trump and a republican led senate will likely pick the next justice for the supreme court, which often hears labor related cases.  “i think it’s going to be a very difficult period,” said lee saunders, president of the american federation of state, county and municipal employees, who said he was surprised by the election outcome despite knocking on doors and talking to members in several states.  among his concerns, he listed a supreme court case this year in which public sector unions scored a victory related to funding organized labor – but only because the court deadlocked 4 4. the appointment of a new conservative judge by trump to replace the late justice antonin scalia could change that. republican nominees will control the national labor relations board (nlrb), which under democratic president barack obama has sought to make it easier for unions to organize. the nlrb is pursuing litigation to establish that mcdonald’s corp is a “joint employer” of workers at its franchised restaurants, a determination that could compel the company to bargain with unions representing employees of its independent franchisees.  republicans will control federal agencies that govern the formation of unions, overtime rules and more. for example, in september the obama administration finalized an executive order requiring federal contractors to provide sick leave to workers, as well as rules expanding the types of data employers are required to provide on pay. a separate labor department rule expanding which employees are eligible for overtime pay is scheduled to take effect next month. those actions drew criticism from business groups, and all could be reversed under a trump administration. “we don’t have a firewall now,” said tom buffenbarger, a prior president of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers who campaigned for clinton.  trump has expressed support for so called right to work legislation, which allows workers to avoid paying union dues. republican leaders in congress have consistently sought such a change at the national level. labor unions say such laws are aimed at undermining collective bargaining and workers’ rights. william gould, chair of the nlrb under democratic president bill clinton and now a professor at stanford law school, said on wednesday that trump was likely to partner with congress in dismantling a host of administration labor initiatives from obama.  republicans “regard unions as first amongst fair game” because of their support for clinton, he said. steven bernstein, a partner at law firm fisher phillips, which represents employers, said the trump administration and congress may also target recent nlrb rulings that allowed workers to picket on private property, expanded the type of worker activity protected by federal labor law and gave graduate students the right to unionize. “it’s also fair to assume that trump will be inclined to repeal a host of executive orders supporting unions,” particularly rules that apply to federal contracts, bernstein said in a statement. organized labor is a key democratic constituency – contributing everything from volunteers to votes for democratic candidates. trump nonetheless carried union heavy states such as pennsylvania, ohio and even michigan, home to the united auto workers (uaw).  in ohio, for example, a fox exit poll said trump won 52 percent of union workers. an exit poll from abc news suggested clinton got no advantage among union households, even after obama won those voters by 23 percentage points. (abcn.ws/2eumxpx) (fxn.ws/2eulxs8) david lephart, a 58 year old uaw pipefitter at a general motors co plant in marion, indiana, voted for trump. he earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his kids through college.  he said union leaders pressed hard for members to support clinton, but the union has not kept its promises to workers in recent years. “i don’t have a tendency to believe what you tell me — when you haven’t fulfilled the promises you’ve made,” he said. uaw president dennis williams in a statement on wednesday said, “we have high hopes that elected officials heard the american people loud and clear about trade, jobs, education and the inequality in this country.” ",0

" u.s. republican presidential candidate marco rubio’s campaign urged a tactical vote against party front runner donald trump on friday, saying rubio supporters in ohio should vote for the state’s governor, john kasich, next week. ohio is one of five states holding republican primary contests on march 15.  “if you’re a republican primary voter in ohio, and you don’t want donald trump to be the nominee, john kasich is your best bet,” rubio spokesman alex conant told cnn in an interview. “if you’re a republican primary voter here in florida and you don’t want donald trump to be your nominee, marco rubio is your best bet. that is indisputable,” he added, referring to the u.s. senator’s home state. rubio, kasich and ted cruz, a u.s. senator from texas, are battling to stop trump from winning the nomination to represent the party in the nov. 8 presidential election.  some republicans, most notably 2012 republican nominee mitt romney, have urged conservatives who oppose trump to vote for which ever alternative candidate is most likely to win certain states in the upcoming primary contests.

" bangladesh has proposed creating  safe zones  run by aid groups for rohingya muslims in myanmar s rakhine state to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing into its territory following a military crackdown. the plan, the latest in a string of ideas floated by dhaka, is unlikely to get much traction in myanmar, where many consider the rohingya community of 1.1 million as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. that will leave bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world, with little choice but to open new camps for refugees.   dhaka sent the proposal to the myanmar government through the international committee of the red cross to secure three areas in rakhine, home to the rohingya community, suggesting that people displaced by the violence be relocated there under the supervision of an international organization, such as the united nations.   the logic of the creation of such zones is that no rohingya can come inside bangladesh,  said shahidul haque, bangladesh s foreign secretary, the top civil servant in the foreign ministry.  the red cross confirmed that it had passed on the request to myanmar but said that it was a political decision for the two countries to make.   a myanmar government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  hundreds of thousands of rohingya have fled to bangladesh, a mostly muslim nation of 160 million, from buddhist majority myanmar in recent years.  the decades old conflict in rakhine flared most recently on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base. since then, an estimated 270,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh, according to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps since the early 1990s. there are widespread fears that tens of thousands more could try to cross if the violence doesn t abate. recent pictures from the border between the two countries show hundreds of rohingya men, women and children trying to cross over into bangladesh on foot and by boat. the humanitarian crisis next door has left bangladesh scrambling to deal with people that it does not welcome either.  in recent days, bangladesh officials have said they plan to go ahead with a controversial plan to develop an isolated, flood prone island in the bay of bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of refugees, drawing fresh criticism from the international community. it bowed to pressure on thursday, with government officials saying that dhaka would now make another 1,500 acres (607 hectares) of land available for camps to house refugees near cox s bazar, where many refugees already live as it is near the border with myanmar.   they will be given temporary shelter,  said kazi abdur rahman, additional deputy commissioner of cox s bazar. but rahman added that the refugees would be fingerprinted and confined to the camp so that they did not mix with the local community.  these measures, however, do not offer a long term solution to the crisis, and dhaka says it is getting little support from its neighbor, which has been accused of trying to engineer  ethnic cleansing within its borders.  bangladesh officials said they had proposed joint patrolling along the border but did not receive a response from myanmar. earlier this week, bangladesh lodged a protest after it said myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel laureate, has come under pressure to halt violence against rohingya.  she has said that her government was doing its best to protect everyone in rakhine but did not refer specifically to the rohingya exodus.  the solution lies in myanmar. the un hopes that myanmar can address the root causes of the problem,  said shinji kubo, head of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in bangladesh.  kubo said the bangladesh government was doing its best by accepting the refugees instead of sending them back. bangladesh officials are turning to the international community for help, claiming support from countries such as turkey, which has promised aid.  on friday, a malaysian coast guard official said the country will not turn away rohingya muslims and is willing to provide them temporary shelter. but any such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months, because of the annual monsoon.  the world community must come forward to help them, not by putting pressure on bangladesh but by putting pressure on myanmar not to resort to these atrocities and violence,  said h.t. imam, a senior aide to bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina.   the only solution is to force myanmar to take back their citizens through international pressure. and we are working with our partners on that,  imam said. besides the creation of internationally controlled safe zones in rakhine state, bangladesh has also mooted creating a buffer zone along the border, where the international community could set up camps and provide for the refugees, the officials said.  further details of the plan could not be learned.    we will give aid agencies access. but we are not interested to give them shelter here. we are already overburdened,  said mostafa kamal uddin, bangladesh s home secretary.

" republican presidential front runner donald trump won the endorsement on tuesday of joe arpaio, the provocative arizona sheriff known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. arpaio joined the real estate billionaire in marshalltown, iowa, to voice his support before the iowa caucuses on monday, the trump campaign said in a statement. the caucuses are the first contest in the nomination race for the nov. 8 presidential election. “i have great respect for sheriff arpaio. we must restore law and order on the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. i thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for president,” trump said, according to the statement. “donald trump is a leader. he produces results and is ready to get tough in order to protect american jobs and families,” arpaio was quoted as saying. “i have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. i know donald trump will stand with me and countless americans to secure our border. i am proud to support him as the best candidate for president of the united states of america,” arpaio added. arpaio, 83, the sheriff of maricopa county, arizona, since 1993, has been found guilty of racial profiling in a federal court, and been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds and unlawful enforcement of immigration laws. he bills himself as “america’s toughest sheriff.”  (reporting by eric walsh in washington; editing by peter cooney) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" nationals from seven muslim majority countries temporarily barred from the united states by president donald trump’s executive order may be blocked indefinitely, and others might be added to the list, homeland security secretary john kelly said on tuesday. under the order released on friday, travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen may not enter the country for at least 90 days while kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. “some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon, if they are countries that are in various states of collapse, as an example,” kelly told a press conference. kelly said others may be added if it is determined they “could tighten up their procedures” to ensure more secure vetting. several lawsuits have been filed blocking portions of the order, which drew harsh criticism from some of trump’s fellow republicans, democrats, human rights organizations and some western u.s. allies.  vice president mike pence was closely questioned about the order by republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch. “obviously what happened friday, they have to understand, was not well done,” republican senator bob corker told reporters. “... there are a lot of issues here that i don’t think were well thought through.” confusion mounted during the weekend as u.s. customs and border protection, a division of the department of homeland security, rushed to brief airlines and customs agents about how to implement trump’s order. the executive action was not explicit about how to handle a wide range of people trying to enter the united states, including permanent residents, students and even iraqi pilots training to protect u.s. troops. acting customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan told reporters he had briefed appropriate parties “within two hours” of the order. kelly said he knew the order was coming and “had people involved in the general drafting of it.” but a department of homeland security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said customs and border protection officers had no advance notice of the order or how to respond. some issues were addressed on tuesday. kelly said people from the seven targeted nations who hold dual citizenship would be allowed to enter the united states on the passport of a non restricted nation, which had been uncertain. the executive order also stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. but the administration granted waivers to 872 “in transit” who will be arriving this week. kelly came to the u.s. capitol later on tuesday to brief congressional leaders and the heads of national security committees about the order. he was peppered with questions from both republicans and democrats concerned about the lack of planning. senator claire mccaskill, the ranking democrat on the senate homeland security committee, said kelly made clear the white house is happy with the order, and that the administration had not wanted to wait to address details about its implementation. “it was pretty clear that the president wanted this executive order put in place, and he wanted it implemented immediately. and it’s not going anywhere,” she told reporters. since the order, 721 travelers with visas from the seven countries were denied boarding u.s. bound flights, according to mcaleenan. the department has also processed 1,060 waivers for legal permanent residents, such as green card holders. kelly said immigration and customs officials were in compliance with court orders and no agent knowingly or intentionally violated them. the trump administration also sought to clarify on tuesday that citizens of u.s. ally israel who were born in arab countries would be allowed into the united states. the u.s. embassy in tel aviv said a valid u.s. visa in an israeli passport would still be valid even if the passport holder was born in one of the seven countries.

" the u.s. congress started to come to grips on tuesday with crafting a multibillion dollar hurricane harvey emergency aid package that president donald trump suggested could be historically large, without providing specifics. on a tour of rescue operations after catastrophic flooding in texas and louisiana, with rain still pounding houston and new orleans, trump told officials and reporters at a briefing that he was working with congress on an aid package. “it’s going to be a costly proposition,” he said. “i think we’ll come through ... with the right solution.” he added, “but probably there’s never been anything so expensive in our country’s history and never been anything so historic in terms of damage.” lawmakers said it was too early to estimate the price tag for u.s. taxpayer assistance on harvey, which has killed at least 11 people and paralyzed houston. hurricane katrina, which killed at least 1,200 people in 2005, was the most damaging storm in u.s. history. after katrina, and two smaller hurricanes that followed behind it, the u.s. government devoted $100 billion to relief and recovery, said the congressional budget office. john cornyn, the senate’s no. 2 republican, said harvey recovery aid will take time. “there may be several different appropriations bills,” cornyn told ktrh radio in houston. “what i would personally like to see is some emergency upfront funds to help with the temporary expenses, but as you can imagine, it is going to take a while to assess the losses.” the head of the u.s. house of representatives’ appropriations committee said the panel was prepared to provide the funding needed. republican representative rodney frelinghuysen said in a statement: “we are awaiting requests from federal agencies who are on the ground, and will not hesitate to take quick action once an official request is sent.” senator ted cruz said on the hugh hewitt radio show, “by any measure it is going to be billions upon billions of dollars.” two senior white house officials said hurricane relief might be handled in congress as a special emergency request, not attached to other spending legislation. congressional leaders have not said exactly how they will handle the aid package. house conservatives may favor a standalone measure. “my sense is that they’d want a relief aid package to be a standalone that doesn’t have a lot of unrelated stuff added on,” said alyssa farah, spokeswoman for the conservative house freedom caucus.

" hurricane irma will pose the toughest test yet for u.s. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan in 2011. irma was on course to hit south florida early on sunday after slamming cuba as a category 5 storm. it weakened to a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (210 km per hour) on saturday, but was expected to strengthen before reaching florida, bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. the national hurricane center s forecast track shows irma making landfall on the southwest side of the florida peninsula, west of the two nuclear reactors at the turkey point plant.  the operator, florida power & light (fpl), has said it will shut turkey point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant. the reactors are about 30 miles (42 kilometers) south of miami. fpl said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in florida at st lucie, which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state s east coast, about 120 miles (193 km) north of miami.  we will shut the reactors down 24 hours before category 1 force winds are forecast to hit,  fpl chief executive eric silagy told a news conference. fpl said both turkey point and st lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. but south miami mayor philip stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at turkey point, which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. at fukushima in japan, an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown.   the whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind, the real problem from my perspective is water,  stoddard said. he said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors.  the real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool.  peter robbins, an fpl spokesman, said  mayor stoddard is wrong. turkey point is safe and is ready for hurricane irma.  u.s. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since fukushima. the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems.  things are better today than in march 2011. time will tell whether better proves good enough,  said dave lochbaum, director of a watchdog group, the nuclear safety project, at the union of concerned scientists. the nrc said it was posting more inspectors at the two florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in georgia and south carolina should the storm head that way. the nrc said the plants should not be compromised by irma s storm surge.  the storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites  designs,  said nrc spokesman scott burnell. both florida plants have previously weathered major storms. turkey point took a hit from hurricane andrew, a category 5 storm, in 1992, damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. repairs cost about $90 million. st lucie withstood the back to back impact of hurricanes frances (category 2) and jeanne (category 3) in 2004. fpl shut st lucie last october as hurricane matthew skirted the florida coast. lochbaum said the nrc and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. in january 2014, about 50,000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the st lucie plant after a heavy downpour. an nrc study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after fukushima. there is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in florida which stopped operating in 2009. that is the crystal river plant, owned by duke energy corp (duk.n). duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. once in storage, the fuel no longer needs cooling.  the nrc s burnell said duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of irma. he said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power, even though it has been shut for years. irma is expected to disrupt much of florida s power supply. fpl, the state s largest electric company, has warned irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. fpl is one of four large publicly traded utilities in florida. other natural disasters since fukushima have shut some plants. an earthquake in virginia in 2011 shut dominion energy inc s (d.n) north anna plant for about 2 1/2 months, the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. that plant sustained no major damage.  hurricane sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the u.s. northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday signed a repeal of obama era broadband privacy rules, the white house said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. republicans in congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. the signing, disclosed in white house statement late on monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for at&t inc, comcast corp and verizon communications inc. the bill repeals regulations adopted in october by the federal communications commission under the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc. the rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. fcc chairman ajit pai praised the repeal in a statement late on monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the obama era plan for regulating the internet.” those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.” pai said the fcc would work with the federal trade commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “ftc’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.” republican fcc commissioners have said the obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. the action is the latest in a string of reversals of obama administration rules. on monday, the fcc reversed a requirement that charter communications inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high speed provider. on friday, comcast, verizon at&t inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information. verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use “de identified” customer browsing data, including one that uses “aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” the american civil liberties union said last month congress should have opposed “industry pressure to put profits over privacy” and added “most americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.” trade group ustelecom chief executive jonathan spalter in a statement praised trump for “stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.” last week, 46 senate democrats urged trump not to sign the bill, arguing most americans “believe that their private information should be just that.”    republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility   a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.

" cuba s top diplomat warned the united states on tuesday against taking hasty decisions over alleged incidents that have harmed u.s. embassy staff in havana and urged its authorities to cooperate on the investigation into the mysterious affair. cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez had called for tuesday s meeting with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson in washington to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former cold war foes. the highest level meeting to take place between the two countries since u.s. president donald trump took office came 10 days after tillerson said the united states was considering closing its recently re opened embassy in havana.  the foreign minister reaffirmed that the investigation to resolve this matter is still in progress,  the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement, noting that  effective cooperation  of u.s. authorities was essential.   it would be regrettable that a matter of this nature is politicized and that hasty decisions not supported by conclusive evidence and investigation results are taken.  the meeting  took place in a respectful ambiance , the  cuban foreign ministry said. the u.s. state department said the conversation was  firm and frank  and tillerson  conveyed the gravity of the situation and underscored the cuban authorities  obligations to protect embassy staff.  washington earlier this year expelled two cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents, which it says caused symptoms from hearing loss to nausea in u.s. embassy staff and their families in havana, although it has so far not laid blame on cuba. cuba reiterated on tuesday that it  has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any kind against diplomats,  and said it had implemented additional measures to protect u.s. personnel since they reported the incidents. the case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since trump took office to the boil. trump, who in june vowed to partially roll back the detente with cuba agreed by his democratic predecessor, president barack obama, called the communist run nation  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the united nations general assembly last week.  he said he would not lift the u.s. trade embargo on the caribbean island until it made  fundamental reforms.  cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.   cuba s investigation had uncovered  no evidence so far of the cause or the origin of the health disorders reported by the u.s. diplomats,  the country s foreign ministry said. experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of cuban american exiles or third party state actors such as russia, iran or north korea, but most flounder. audiologists, for example, have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

" illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by chicago mayor rahm emanuel for two of the city’s struggling pension funds and castigated it as a “kick the can approach.” the financial footing and credit ratings for the nation’s third largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to $33.8 billion for chicago’s four retirement systems in the most recent accounting. the plan that passed the illinois senate unanimously in january and cleared the house overwhelmingly last december would have granted the state’s blessing to alter the city’s pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers’ retirement systems. the systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign off of the city’s enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them 90 percent funded in 40 years. city officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in 2023 when payments will reach actuarially required levels. but rauner rejected the package, saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for chicago. he said it needed to be part of a broader, statewide pension funding strategy to address illinois’ $129.8 billion unfunded pension liability. “this is another kick the can approach to pension funding that landed chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place,” rauner said in a prepared statement. “this bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem.” a spokesman for the democratic mayor slammed the republican governor’s action as an “irresponsible and irrational decision.” “instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle class retirees, the governor chose to hold them hostage – just as he has done to social service providers, schoolchildren and universities across the state,” emanuel spokesman adam collins said in a statement, referring to rauner’s inability to broker a state budget deal for 21 months. rauner’s action left democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state general assembly, which ended in mid january, and the governor’s only options were to approve or reject the measure. but the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state senate in late january and is awaiting action in the house, collins said.

" u.s. president donald trump flew to mississippi on saturday to attend the opening of a civil rights museum, but his visit was marred by the absence of top african american leaders who stayed away in protest of his policies and record on race relations. trump toured the mississippi civil rights museum and delivered brief remarks, paying tribute to african americans who fought institutionalized racism, including medgar evers, the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in jackson in 1963. “we want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred and surrounded by love, opportunity and hope,” trump said in prepared remarks. referring to evers and other civil rights leaders showcased in the museum, trump said: “today we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. we pray for inspiration from their example.” trump acknowledged evers’ wife myrlie and brother charles in the audience. u.s. representative john lewis of georgia, a democrat who marched with martin luther king jr. in the 1960s, said on thursday that he would not go to the museum opening because of trump’s presence. “president trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,” lewis said in a statement with mississippi democratic u.s. representative bennie thompson, who also declined to attend. the two men also cited trump’s “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and national football league players” and said the president had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in mississippi. the national association for the advancement of colored people also took issue with trump’s attendance. however, u.s. housing and urban development secretary ben carson, who is black and ran against trump in the early 2016 republican presidential primaries before dropping out, accompanied the president on his tour of the museum. trump, a republican, has had a complicated record on race relations. he was a leading proponent of the false theory that democratic president barack obama, the first black u.s. president, was not born in the united states. obama was born in hawaii, a u.s. state. in august, trump unleashed a firestorm of criticism, including from republicans and a top adviser in his administration, for saying that both left  and right wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist led rally in charlottesville, virginia, where one woman died. white house spokesman raj shah said on friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance, hatred and bigotry and that trump intended to honor the leaders of that struggle. the white house called the decision by lewis and thompson not to attend “unfortunate.” trump concluded his remarks by saying: “today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality justice and peace.” ",0
" facebook inc (fb.o), alphabet inc’s google (googl.o), apple inc (aapl.o) and other major technology firms are largely absent from a debate over the renewal of a broad u.s. internet surveillance law, weakening prospects for privacy reforms that would further protect customer data, according to sources familiar with the matter. while tech companies often lobby washington on privacy issues, the major firms have been hesitant to enter a fray over a controversial portion of the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa), industry lobbyists, congressional aides and civil liberties advocates said.  among their concerns is that doing so could jeopardize a trans atlantic data transfer pact underpinning billions of dollars in trade in digital services, the sources said. technology companies and privacy groups have for years complained about the part of fisa known as section 702 that allows the u.s. national security agency (nsa) to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas. though targeted at foreigners, the surveillance also collects data on an unknown number of americans   some privacy advocates have suggested it could be millions   without a search warrant. section 702 will expire at the end of the year unless the republican controlled congress votes to reauthorize it. the white house, u.s. intelligence agencies and many republican senators want to renew the law, which they consider vital to national security, without changes and make it permanent. a coalition of democrats and libertarian leaning conservatives prefer, however, to amend the law with more privacy safeguards. reform government surveillance, a coalition of tech firms established after the 2013 leaks by former nsa contractor edward snowden, said reforming the law remains a priority. a spokeswoman declined to comment further but referred to two letters sent earlier this year by technology companies urging congress to consider changes to the law. snowden exposed the spy agency’s program that collected u.s. phone call metadata in bulk and also the extent of spying under section 702, embarrassing some u.s. technology firms. the companies, working with privacy rights activists, successfully lobbied congress two years ago to pass legislation that curtailed the nsa’s bulk collection of call records. for example, facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg wrote on his facebook page that he had personally called then president barack obama to express “frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future.” now, however, silicon valley’s reduced involvement frustrates civil liberties groups because of a widely held view that section 702 poses a far greater threat to privacy than the telephone program, which did not harvest actual content. facebook declined comment. google and apple did not respond to requests for comment. the companies’ relative inactivity is explained by several legal challenges in europe to an agreement between the united states and the european union, known as the privacy shield, the sources said. the litigation hinges on whether u.s. surveillance practices afford enough privacy safeguards. a coalition of human rights organizations has urged europe to suspend privacy shield unless section 702 is substantially reformed. u.s. technology companies have privately bristled at those efforts, three industry lobbyists said, in part because expectations that 702 reforms will pass congress are low. “if you link them and you lose one, you lose both,” said one of the lobbyists, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with technology companies.  the lobbyist added that several major firms were more interested in making deals with the trump administration that could affect their bottom lines, such as tax repatriation, than getting caught in politically charged fights over government surveillance. another industry lobbyist said section 702 surveillance is “not a c suite issue” that concerns chief executives in silicon valley like other issues, including encryption. companies have also been limited in how they can lobby for changes to the law because no comprehensive reform bill has been introduced yet in congress, said alex abdo, a privacy advocate and staff attorney at the knight first amendment institute at columbia university.  a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the house judiciary committee is not expected to introduce such legislation until after congress returns from its august recess. the schism between tech companies and privacy groups was on display earlier this year in litigation in ireland   facebook argued customer data was sufficiently protected from u.s. spying programs, while an attorney for the american civil liberties union testified that more protections were needed. snowden’s leaks showed that section 702 collects content of digital communications directly from the internet backbone and through a program formerly code named prism where the nsa gathered data directly from several companies, including facebook, google, apple and microsoft corp (msft.o). the statute also allows the fbi and others to query pools of data collection for u.s. information in what critics have derided as a “backdoor search loophole” that evades traditional warrant requirements.  the tech industry may become more engaged once the public debate becomes clearer, abdo said. he added that a stronger position “would be enormously helpful to those that want to impose meaningful constraint on nsa surveillance.” (this version of the story has been refiled to add dropped word “said” in paragraph 14) ",0
" colombia’s peace deal with the marxist farc rebel group will bring more investment to the country, backed partly by new donor aid and loans from multilateral development banks, u.s. treasury secretary jack lew and his colombian counterpart said on wednesday.     lew told a news conference in bogota that the peace accord, signed on monday and set to be voted on by the colombian people on sunday, would add to the confidence of foreign investors in colombia. the 52 year war killed 220,000 people and left millions displaced.     “implementing the agreement, showing that colombia has a stable future, i think will make colombia a more attractive place for foreign investment,” lew said after meeting with colombian finance minister mauricio cardenas and president juan manuel santos.      he said santos’ government already had an “excellent reputation” among foreign investors for sound management of fiscal policy and pursuit of economic reforms, despite major challenges from low oil prices. cardenas said the peace accord would attract both domestic and foreign investment and spur new spending on infrastructure and schools in former conflict areas. he declined to specify amounts but previously estimated that peace with farc could boost colombia’s economic growth by 1 percentage point annually.      “it will be at the initial stages, more tourism. that’s one of the areas we think the agreement will have the most direct and immediate impact,” cardenas said. “we will be able also to secure additional funding through cooperation, donors and lending by multilaterals to support expenditures and investments in the rural communities where the conflict was most acute.”     former farc fighters are already making plans for eco tourism ventures and cheesemaking operations in vast jungles largely untouched for decades. the peace deal gives farc a voice in colombia’s political process. cardenas said that put the group “in the competition for ideas” but would not alter the center right government’s economic reform plan, “which thinks that one of the pillars of the success of any country is having low inflation, low fiscal deficit, low debt, and at the same time having a progressive agenda.”          lew said the united states was still committed to providing bilateral aid to colombia and that he and cardenas discussed opportunities to gain support from multilateral institutions such as the international monetary fund, world bank and inter american development bank.

" canada’s charismatic prime minister justin trudeau will be traveling to washington this week for talks with u.s. president barack obama, hoping to revitalize a frayed relationship and draw rare attention to canadian issues. trudeau’s liberals came to power in november by ousting the right wing conservative leader stephen harper, whose ties with washington deteriorated as he hectored obama in a failed bid to gain approval for a major canada u.s. pipeline. trudeau, who has basked in international media attention since coming to power and whose progressive politics are much more in tune with obama’s, will attend a state dinner thursday, becoming the first canadian leader to do so since 1997. “we want to strengthen our relationship with the united states at a time when it is key for our agenda of economic growth,” foreign minister stephane dion said in an interview on monday.  canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the united states. it is also the united states’ largest trading partner and biggest supplier of oil, but has found it hard to stand out. “we’d sometimes like to think that americans would pay attention to us from time to time,” trudeau said in an interview with the cbs television show “60 minutes” that aired on sunday. trudeau will press his message on thursday, holding talks with obama, lunching with secretary of state john kerry and then attending the state dinner. canada wants to avoid a fresh trade fight over its softwood lumber exports, while the united states will reiterate long standing concerns about how much information ottawa shares on terror suspects, say officials involved with the talks. the two sides are also set to sign a declaration committing to the fight against climate change, sources said. “canada’s not an issue that gets a lot of attention normally,” said a senior u.s. administration official. “(but) i’d be hard pressed to identify a relationship that’s more important day in, day out, and that affects more americans day in, day out.” trudeau has a higher profile than any canadian leader since his father, former prime minister pierre trudeau, was in power four decades ago. the new york times and vogue magazine are among the u.s. outlets that have run sympathetic profiles about him. still, his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race between republican candidates vying to run for the white house. thursday’s dinner coincides with a republican debate in the battleground state of florida.

" the u.s. congress is headed for a seven week recess without addressing gun violence, the zika virus outbreak and other pressing issues, amid persistent election year bickering. despite recent gun violence, the house of representatives will not vote this week on a proposal to keep firearms out of the hands of people on terrorism watch lists, that chamber’s republican leader kevin mccarthy told reporters on tuesday. similarly, president barack obama’s request for $1.9 billion in funds to combat the zika virus and the birth defects it can cause has been stalled in congress since february. republicans and democrats were also at odds over spending bills to keep the government functioning beyond sept. 30, when current fiscal year funding expires. when republicans took control of congress, they vowed to get things done but have had difficulty doing so during this election year, failing to pass a budget or even consider obama’s nomination of merrick garland to fill a supreme court vacancy. congress did, however, approve bipartisan legislation helping puerto rico out of a crippling debt crisis and is trying to make progress on legislation to improve police relations with local communities in the aftermath of gun violence. with barely four days left before the start of an unusually long recess, a failure to vote on guns would postpone any possible action by the house until at least sept. 6, when lawmakers return. after that, they will work only for short stints ahead of the nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. mass shootings in orlando and dallas, and gun violence in other cities, has again propelled gun control to prominence. but the national rifle association and its allies in congress so far have staved off legislation. gun control is generally opposed by republicans and supported by democrats. some republicans have talked about a gun bill possibly moving through congress in the fall, in the midst of the campaign season, but democrats were skeptical. “this congress will do nothing on curbing gun violence,” representative xavier becerra of california, a member of the house democratic leadership, told reporters. the two sides even disagree on whether house speaker paul ryan and house democratic leader nancy pelosi talked about a proposal to establish a special committee to study gun violence. democrats say pelosi raised the issue with ryan last week. ryan’s office says he has never discussed the topic with anyone. republicans in the house and senate have signed onto a $1.1 billion zika funding bill. but democrats are balking over what they see as “poison pills” attached to the money that would deny funds to women’s healthcare provider planned parenthood and ease some environmental provisions. democrats, who warn the current legislation will not pass the senate, said on tuesday that they offered to accept some republican provisions. but senate republicans insist the bill cannot be altered.  ryan meanwhile showcased his “a better way” agenda, flashing a glossy pamphlet at a press conference listing proposals designed to lure votes in november but do nothing this year legislatively. republicans have also pushed for new federal probes of hillary clinton, the presumptive democratic presidential nominee, on her use of private emails while secretary of state.

" queen elizabeth and husband prince philip mark their platinum wedding anniversary with a small family get together on monday, a far cry from the pomp and celebration which greeted their marriage 70 years ago. the couple married at london s westminster abbey on nov. 20, 1947, just two years after the end of world war two, in a glittering ceremony which attracted statesmen and royalty from around the world and huge crowds of cheering well wishers. seventy years on, no public events are planned, although the 91 year old queen did acknowledge the occasion by appointing philip a knight grand cross of the royal victorian order for his services to the sovereign. elizabeth and her 96 year old husband, who retired from active public life in august, will celebrate their milestone with a private party at windsor castle, the monarch s home to the west of london. that contrasts with their silver, golden and diamond wedding anniversaries when they attended thanksgiving services at the thousand year old abbey, where the queen was crowned and where her grandson and his wife, william and kate, were married in 2011. however, the abbey itself will mark the occasion with a full peal of its bells involving 5,070 change of sequences, with the 70 reflecting the anniversary, which will last more than three hours.  congratulations to the queen and the duke of edinburgh as they celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary,  prime minister theresa may said on twitter.  they have devoted their lives to the service of the uk and the commonwealth   my best wishes to them both on this special occasion.  the wedding of princess elizabeth, as she then was, to the dashing naval officer philip mountbatten was seen as raising the nation s spirits amid an austere background of rationing and shortages that followed the war.   millions will welcome this joyous event as a flash of colour on the hard road we have to travel,  said former prime minister winston churchill. five years later, elizabeth succeeded her father george vi on the throne and has ruled for the following 65 years, more than any other monarch in british history, with philip by her side throughout.  the support he gives to my grandmother is phenomenal,  prince harry said in a documentary to mark her 60th year on the throne.  regardless of whether my grandfather seems to be doing his own thing, sort of wandering off like a fish down the river, the fact that he s there   i personally don t think that she could do it without him.  while the couple s marriage has remained strong, three of their four children have seen their unions end in divorce, most notably heir prince charles s ill fated union with his late first wife princess diana.  he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,  elizabeth said in a speech to mark the couple s 50th wedding anniversary in 1997. royal historian hugo vickers said the secret of their long marriage was their mutual support and devotion to duty.  they don t waste a jot of time wondering whether we like them or not   they just get on with the job,  he told reuters.   on the occasions when i have been lucky enough to see them together, they always look incredibly comfortable in each other s company.

" u.s. representative ileana ros lehtinen, a moderate republican from south florida who has been critical of president donald trump, plans to retire when her term is up next year, according to an interview she gave on sunday to the miami herald. the decision by ros lehtinen not to seek re election could give democrats a chance to pick up a seat in the 2018 congressional election. her district has increasingly leaned democratic, and democrat hillary clinton, trump’s opponent, won it by 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. ros lehtinen, 64, declined to endorse trump during the white house race and differed with him on issues such as immigration. she balked at supporting the proposed obamacare replacement legislation that the president backed. ros lehtinen, who was born in havana, became the first cuban american and the first hispanic woman elected to congress in 1989.  the veteran republican congresswoman had fended off a challenge in 2016 from democrat scott fuhrman. fuhrman has said he plans to run again for the seat in 2018, when all of the members of the house of representatives and one third of the u.s. senate will face re election. trump’s republicans currently control both the house and senate. after the miami herald article was published, fuhrman tweeted that he wished ros lehtinen “all the best in retirement” and thanked her for “decades of public service” to the community. ros lehtinen told the newspaper that her decision was motivated by a desire to seek new challenges in her life and did not stem from concern that she would not be re elected. “there was no epiphany,” she said. “there was no moment, nothing that has happened that i’ve said, ‘i’ve got to move on.’” the democratic congressional campaign committee, the campaign arm for democrats in the house of representatives, said in a statement that ros lehtinen’s plans to retire were a recognition that she was vulnerable. it is “all but guaranteed” that the seat will go to a democrat when she leaves, the committee said.

" pope francis on thursday urged colombians to shun vengeance after a bloody 50 year civil war but said leaders had to enact laws to end the  darkness  of injustice and social inequality that breeds violence. at the last event of a packed day, the argentine pontiff said mass for a crowd estimated by colombian authorities at just over a million people in bogota s sprawling simon bolivar park. under a light drizzle, he ended the day as he had begun it, urging colombians in his homily to put their differences behind them and beware  the darkness of thirst for vengeance . hours earlier, at the start of his first full day in the country, he had told government leaders in the courtyard of the presidential palace that all colombians should see peace as a long term commitment and not allow it to be weakened by partisan politics. colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters of the farc guerrilla group into society and aim to repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. many colombians are furious that under the 2016 peace deal, farc leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail and may receive seats in congress as members of a political party. president juan manuel santos, who attended both events and is the architect of the peace accord, has an approval rating of about 24 percent. in both speeches, francis denounced the social inequality that still plagues colombia, which has extreme poverty in some rural areas. at the morning event, he told leaders that  just laws  were needed to  resolve the structural causes of poverty that lead to exclusion and violence , calling social inequality  the root of social ills.  in the evening the leader of the world s roman catholics  told colombians huddled on wet fields:  here, as in other places, there is a thick darkness which threatens and destroys life   the darkness of injustice and social inequality.  as part of the peace agreement, the government agreed with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) to distribute more land to poor rural communities and to invest and bring development to war torn areas. the farc, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, has also pledged to help subsistence farmers switch from illegal crops like coca, the raw material that makes cocaine, to food.  we want to hear the message of love and peace, so that we open our hearts and leave hatred behind,  said 54 year old william soacha, a clothes salesman, waiting with his family under the rain for the pope s mass to begin. the 80 year old pope, who showed signs of fatigue by thursday night, has received a tumultuous welcome since his arrival on wednesday, with his motorcade having to stop or slow down often because of crowds mobbing the  popemobile . in his speech at the presidential palace, the pope quoted from the 1982 nobel prize acceptance speech of colombian writer gabriel garcia marquez about life and love being the proper response to oppression. in an apparent reference to the late author s best known work,  one hundred years of solitude , he added:   there has been too much hatred and vengeance. the solitude of always being at loggerheads has been familiar for decades, and its smell has lingered for a hundred years; we do not want any type of violence whatsoever to restrict or destroy one more life,  he said. he also prayed in the colonial cathedral before a painting of our lady of chiquinquira, the patron saint of overwhelmingly catholic colombia, before addressing a raucous crowd of young people.  he left a message in the cathedral s visitor book, writing:  i come here as a witness of peace, of the peace that god wants for colombia. this will be possible with the efforts of all.  he will visit the cities of villavicencio, medellin and cartagena before leaving for rome on sunday night.

" u.s. president barack obama’s nominee to the supreme court, merrick garland, will submit a filled out questionnaire and other information to the senate judiciary committee on tuesday to spur a vote on his nomination, the white house said. “the questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive picture of judge garland’s distinguished career and impeccable credentials as a nominee to the supreme court,” white house spokeswoman brandi hoffine said in an emailed statement on monday. republican senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley has refused to hold hearings on garland’s nomination. republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has refused to act on obama’s pick, saying whoever wins the nov. 8 presidential election should choose a nominee to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died in february. the white house declined to release garland’s questionnaire on monday. it repeated its call for the senate to hold a hearing on his nomination once lawmakers had reviewed the new information. “every nominee since 1875 who wasn’t withdrawn from consideration has received a hearing and/or a vote,” hoffine said. “with more federal judicial experience than any other supreme court nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the senate will give chief judge garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.” ",0

" republican lawmakers on tuesday asked the u.s. treasury secretary to review the process a government council uses to label non bank institutions “too big to fail,” saying the additional capital requirements and regulations are too onerous. the current designation process “lacks transparency and accountability, insufficiently tracks data, and does not have a consistent methodology for determinations,” wrote 10 republican senators to treasury secretary steve mnuchin, who chairs the financial stability oversight council.  the council “has created substantial new regulatory costs while putting taxpayers on the hook for any future bailout to these firms,” said the letter, signed by arkansas senator tom cotton and idaho senator mike crapo, who chairs the senate’s banking committee.  treasury did not immediately comment on the letter. the financial stability oversight council was created by the dodd frank wall street reform law, which former democratic president barack obama signed in 2010 to prevent a repeat of the 2007 09 financial crisis. republicans consider the designations of non banks one of the most egregious extensions of federal power included in the law. only two insurers, american international group inc and prudential financial inc currently have the label, which triggers tougher oversight and requires them to hold more capital in case they come into crisis. a judge last year struck down the designation of metlife inc, and the government under obama appealed the ruling. until the appeal is decided, metlife is not considered systemically important. while an overhaul of dodd frank is progressing in the house of representatives, reform efforts are moving slowly in the senate. representative ann wagner, a republican from missouri, on tuesday said the republican plan, called the choice act, would make the council more accountable. as chair of the council, mnuchin may be able to make changes faster than lawmakers. he has said he would like to review the council’s work and republican president donald trump has said he wants to cut a lot out of dodd frank. a spokeswoman for cotton said there were moves mnuchin, appointed by trump, could make without legislation, such as dropping the metlife appeal, releasing fsoc’s criteria for labeling non banks as systemically important, or providing steps that designated companies can follow to have the label lifted.

"chris christie s campaign has signaled that the new jersey governor has finally read the writing on the wall and will announce the end of presidential campaign soon. it s surely a victory for america (although probably disappointing for new jersey residents) to see christie return from whence he came, but amid the celebrations let s remember: there were some good times too.like when christie single-handedly destroyed marco rubio s chances of ever being president.it will go down in history as one of 2016 s defining political moments. live and on the debate stage, a combative christie managed to utterly embarrass the ill-prepared, shallow marco rubio in a matter of seconds. in an election that has been far too consumed with cheap talking points and heavily-rehearsed performance art, we got to see, in that instant, the moment two candidates stopped being polite and started being real.rubio crumpled   and it was painful to watch.it s hard to know what rubio was thinking after getting so completely shut down   in fairness, it s hard to think above the noise of whirring of gears and cpu cooling fans   but afterwards the effect was clear. the candidate most journalists had already ordained as the presumptive republican nominee was dead in the water. rubio s campaign limps on, but in the way a ghost might if his end was so sudden he never realized he died at all.the washington post s dana milbank puts it better:tuesday night, rubio proved true the axiom popularized by alan simpson, the wisecracking former senator from wyoming:  one day you re the toast of the town, the next you re toast. now, to be clear, let s not give christie too much credit for his kamikaze finish. the infamous blowhard was   and remains   a complete asshole. his quest to take down his opponents doesn t stem from some higher moral principles   he just likes being a bully. returning to new jersey, he will go on being a bully. that s christie s whole shtick. in this light, christie s rubio takedown was a joker-like desire just to see the world burn. he takes down rubio because he can, not because he wants to.but regardless of motives, christie was a refreshing change of pace. trump also insults his fellow candidates, but his diminished intellect and massive ego mean that they are typically low-blows, potshots and vulgarity. christie, having practiced the artform numerous times against teachers and nurses, is capable of bullying on the next level.now christie returns to new jersey, a place where most residents despise him and most attorneys have grown fat off his nearly-endless stream of self-induced scandals. at one time he was considered a republican frontrunner. it never panned out. instead, he ll have to be content with the idea that while there will never be a chris christie white house, there won t be a marco rubio one either thanks to him.we all have our parts to play. maybe this one is christie s.feature image from screengrab ",1
" pennsylvania governor tom wolf is expected to unveil his proposal for the state’s 2017 budget on tuesday even though state lawmakers have yet to fully agree on the current spending plan that has languished half baked as political acrimony has escalated. the state still has only a partial $23.4 billion emergency budget in place nearly a year after wolf made his 2016 budget proposal the first time, for $29.9 billion. wolf, a democrat, had said he would support a negotiated budget of $30.8 billion, but state house republican leaders scuttled it at the last minute in december. “it’s a gigantic cloud hanging over this year’s process,” said christopher borick, associate political science professor at muhlenberg college in allentown, pennsylvania, of the impasse and partial budget.     the incomplete deal, which wolf called “garbage” and a “ridiculous exercise in budget futility” before stripping it down and signing it in december, was hammered out after school districts across the state threatened to close because of the lack of funding. one question now is whether wolf will use that tone, or a more conciliatory one, during tuesday’s budget address. “wolf is committed to his agenda. i think he believes it’s the right thing to do,” said g. terry madonna, public affairs professor at pennsylvania’s franklin & marshall college. wolf took office in january 2015 pledging to restore education funding, to be paid for in part with a tax on natural gas extraction. he has already said his new budget will include $200 million of additional funding for k 12 public schools, on top of the $377 million increase proposed in the now defunct compromise budget that senate republicans had supported. but while wolf may view his clear win in 2014 over incumbent republican governor tom corbett as a mandate from voters, republicans can point to how they increased their majorities in both houses of the state legislature in that election. those results “represented very mixed messages from the voters of the state,” borick said. “that sowed the seeds very much for the type of gridlock we saw last year, where both sides felt empowered.” the logjam makes fixes for the state’s now $2.3 billion structural budget deficit that much harder, moody’s investors service said in october when it threatened to lower its aa3 rating on pennsylvania’s nearly $11 billion of outstanding general obligation debt.

" chicago on monday sued to prevent the trump administration from enforcing new policies that would withhold money from so called sanctuary cities that deny u.s. immigration officials access to local jails. the lawsuit, filed in u.s. district court, said the federal policies force the nation’s third largest city to choose between its constitutional rights and funding for law enforcement. “these new conditions also fly in the face of longstanding city policy that promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities,” the lawsuit said. the policies also include a requirement that local law enforcement agencies give federal authorities 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations. democratic mayor rahm emanuel said on sunday that the city would sue, escalating a pushback against an immigration crackdown launched by republican president donald trump’s administration. “we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric, the threats from this administration embodied in these new conditions imposed on unrelated public safety grants funds are breeding a culture and climate of fear,” emanuel’s senior legal adviser, corporation counsel ed siskel, said on monday.the conditions from the justice department apply to the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grants, which provide money to hundreds of cities. chicago is expected to receive $3.2 million this year for purchasing equipment. siskel said the city will follow the initial complaint with a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the government’s imposition of the new conditions.  the city will request a decision from the judge before the sept. 5 deadline to apply for the byrne grant, siskel said. u.s. attorney general jeff sessions said on monday that chicago officials have shown an “open hostility” to enforcing laws designed to reduce crime and protect law enforcement.  he added that more chicagoans were murdered last year than residents of los angeles and new york combined, and that chicago needed to reverse a “culture of lawlessness.” “this administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,” sessions said in a statement. the lawsuit is the first to challenge the justice department over the byrne program but is not the first legal attack on the administration’s sanctuary city policies.  emanuel said on sunday that the lawsuit would prevent the administration from setting a precedent that could be used to target other funding. sanctuary cities in general offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. dozens of local governments and cities, including new york and san francisco, are part of the sanctuary movement. “sanctuary city” is not an official designation. the lawsuit came nearly two weeks after sessions said the justice department would bar cities from the byrne program unless they allowed immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and give the 48 hours pre release notice. chicago and its high murder rate have been frequently criticized by trump, and cracking down on illegal immigration was a theme of his 2016 presidential campaign.

" north korea has been condemned internationally for conducting its most powerful nuclear test yet, but, across the border, south korean president moon jae in is also attracting flak for his policy of pursuing engagement with pyongyang. rebuked by u.s. president donald trump, moon is facing growing calls at home to change course and take a tougher line against north korea, even from his core support base of young liberals, according to hundreds of comments posted online. moon, who swept to power after winning a may 9 election, remains hugely popular but his policy of pursuing both pressure and dialogue with the north is now under scrutiny. trump was blunt about the situation facing south korea, one of washington s biggest allies in asia.  south korea is finding, as i have told them, that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work, they (north korea) only understand one thing,  he said in a tweet on sunday, after the nuclear test. within south korea, doubts about the  moonshine  policy of engaging the north have been growing in recent weeks because there has been no change in the pace of the north s ballistic missile testing since moon took office. the north twice test fired intercontinental ballistic missiles in july. now, despite international warnings, it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sunday.  you said you will not have dialogue with the north if the north conducts a nuclear test. keep your word,  said a post on the facebook page of the presidential blue house from a user named kim bojoong. moon said during his campaign for the presidency that dialogue would be  impossible for quite some time  if the north were to go ahead with another nuclear test. however, moon indicated on sunday at a national security council meeting that he had not given up on using pressure to bring the north to the negotiating table, a sentiment he repeated on monday in a telephone call with japan s prime minister shinzo abe.  pressure must be strengthened until the north comes to the table for dialogue,  the presidential blue house quoted moon as telling abe. moon and trump spoke by phone later on monday, and the blue house said the two agreed it was time to apply the strongest sanctions and pressure on north korea and that stronger sanctions would be pursued at the united nations. in another post on the palace s facebook page, user shin sanggyun said:  we know things are tough for you, mister president, but our response to the north s nuclear pursuit has been rather feeble.   it is time south korea start considering using its shipbuilding expertise to build nuclear submarines and junior aircraft carriers, shin said. the facebook posts were among hundreds of similar messages left on official social media maintained and monitored by the blue house including its twitter account and on the country s largest naver.com web portal. sentiment expressed on south korea s social media, where users are predominantly people in their 20s and 30s, has been a barometer of political support for moon, a former human rights lawyer swept to power by an anti graft movement that brought down his predecessor park geun hye. moon s support rating has slipped slightly in recent days but he remains hugely popular. a public opinion survey by the realmeter polling agency conducted two days before sunday s nuclear test and released on monday showed support for moon fell by 0.8 percentage point from a week ago to 73.1 percent.  but support among youngsters was strong with moon getting an 85 percent approval rating among people in their 20s. south korea s conservative opposition parties said the moon government s expectations about north korea were unrealistic and isolating the country from its allies.  while the moon jae in government made appeasement gestures and haggled for dialogue despite the north s continued provocations, we have become a nuclear hostage,  a senior liberal korea party member, kim tae heum, said on monday. moon s push for dialogue was bound to hit a dead end because pyongyang never really considered the south as a dialogue partner, said kim jun seok, political diplomacy professor at dongguk university in seoul.  they have to acknowledge us as a partner for talks, but all north korea wants is to talk with the united states,  kim said.

" more republicans now think democrat hillary clinton, rather than donald trump, will win the presidency, as their party’s candidate struggles with difficulties including allegations of sexual misconduct and his suggestion he may not honor the outcome of the election. a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday and conducted from oct. 20 to oct. 24 found that 41 percent of republicans expected clinton to win the nov. 8 election, versus 40 percent who picked trump. that reflected a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of republicans said they thought their party’s nominee would win, versus 23 percent who expected clinton to prevail.  among trump’s supporters, 49 percent in the latest poll said they believed trump would win, down from 67 percent who felt that way at the beginning of the month. “there’s still hope, i guess. i just don’t have a great deal of faith in a good portion of the american public,” said bert horsley, 38, of belgrade, montana, who said he planned to vote for trump even though he believed clinton would win.  horsley said he felt the country was leaning increasingly socialist and that voters were more inclined to focus on trump’s problems than on issues facing clinton, including allegations she mishandled classified emails while secretary of state. “the nation’s willing to overlook certain things in some people and not in others,” he said. despite the growing pessimism, trump, who trails clinton in national opinion polls, still enjoys overwhelming support from members of his party. some 79 percent of likely republican voters said they would vote for him. many said their support was rooted in an expectation he would promote a conservative agenda in congress and appoint conservative justices to the supreme court.     democrats appear to be strongly anticipating a clinton presidency. some 83 percent of democrats said in the poll they thought she would win, while only 8 percent predicted trump would become president. among clinton’s supporters, 92 percent expected her to win, up from 83 percent a month earlier. clinton held a commanding lead in the race to win the electoral college and claim the presidency, according to results from the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project released on saturday. trump, a businessman and former reality television star, has alarmed mainstream republicans throughout his campaign by routinely bashing the political establishment and making a series of provocative statements.  he aroused criticism for belittling the parents of a u.s. soldier killed in the iraq war, calling for a ban on admitting muslims to the country and accusing a judge of bias because of his hispanic heritage. he has also asserted, without showing evidence, that the u.s. electoral system is rigged. but republicans remained mostly confident in their candidate’s chances until this month, when a videotape from 2005 was released in which trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about kissing and groping women.  at least 10 women have since accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. trump has denied the women’s allegations, calling them “totally and absolutely false” and has promised to sue the women after the election. trump has also deepened divisions within his party by refusing to promise to accept the outcome of the election. “i will keep you in suspense,” he said when asked about the issue  during an oct. 19 debate with clinton. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english with american adults in all 50 states. the latest poll included 648 people who identified as republicans and 771 people who identified as democrats. it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 4 percentage points.

" the u.s. attorney’s office in manhattan is investigating paul manafort for potential money laundering, according to media reports, adding to other federal and state probes targeting president donald trump’s former campaign manager. the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york launched the probe in conjunction with federal special counsel robert mueller, the wall street journal reported late on tuesday. bloomberg separately reported that subpoenas had been issued in the case. representatives for manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports. the manhattan u.s. attorney’s office, led by acting u.s. attorney joon kim, had no comment.      the probe marks the latest investigation of manafort that comes amid the ongoing larger examination of alleged russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and possible collusion by the trump campaign and associates.  separate investigations into manafort’s financial transactions have been launched by new york attorney general eric schneiderman and manhattan district attorney cyrus vance, including scrutiny of manafort’s real estate deals.  u.s. investigators examining manafort’s financial transactions are seeking to push him into cooperating with their probe into the possible collusion, two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation have said.  manafort, who headed the trump campaign for several months before resigning, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. mueller’s team and congressional investigators are also probing manafort, whose virginia apartment was raided by agents with the federal bureau of investigation in july.  russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as a political witch hunt. reports of the latest probe come as trump is poised to appoint dozens of new u.s. attorneys across the united states, including in new york after seeking mass resignations earlier this year. kim took over as the manhattan u.s. attorney when trump fired preet bharara as part of the wave of resignations in march.  earlier this month, politico reported that trump personally interviewed at least two candidates for the positions in manhattan and brooklyn, an unusual move that raised some questions given trump’s business roots in new york.  the brooklyn u.s. attorney’s office is examining kushner cos, the company owned by the family of trump’s son in law and white house adviser jared kushner, according to the journal. the white house and u.s. attorney general jeff sessions have defended trump’s right to talk with potential nominees, politico said.  the u.s. senate must approve whomever trump nominates, a move that could be complicated by the manafort and other probes.

" myanmar is facing a  defining moment  and must stop the violence against its ethnic minority rohingya population, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday. attacks by rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh. on a visit to london where he met british prime minister theresa may and foreign minister, boris johnson, he told a news conference:  i think it is a defining moment in many ways for this new, emerging democracy.  he said he understood that myanmar s aung san suu kyi, a nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in myanmar, was in a power sharing agreement with the military and the  complex situation  in which she found herself.  i think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity,  he added.  this violence must stop, this persecution must stop.

" the new president of the world s largest humanitarian network, the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), promised on tuesday to crack down on corruption after a scandal over ebola funds in west africa. francesco rocca, who headed the italian red cross and oversaw its role in the mediterranean refugee crisis, was elected on monday to lead the ifrc. he said the organization should have  zero tolerance for any grey area or black hole  and its 190 national societies should adopt  very strict  policies.   what has happened could jeopardize our credibility,  rocca told reuters. last month the ifrc said it had uncovered fraud committed during its operations to combat the deadly ebola virus outbreak in guinea, liberia and sierra leone in 2014 2016.  the estimated losses totaled 6 million swiss francs, including suspected collusion between ifrc staff and bank employees in sierra leone, fake billing in guinea and inflated prices and payments in liberia.   it s a huge offense to our volunteers, who spend their lives and sacrifice their time (away from) their family, their friends, their free time, sometimes their job, to spend for humanity,  rocca said.  then someone is creating profit on their shoulders. it is something that is really unacceptable.  rocca said other priorities for the organization included recruiting more volunteers to help cope with bigger and more frequent natural disasters, and persuading politicians to take the right decisions. politicians were too concerned about the present and needed to think longer term to solve big problems, rocca said.  one such issue was the flow of migrants and refugees from africa to europe, thousands of whom die every year as they try to cross the sahara and the mediterranean.   if after 30 years people are still escaping for the same reason, perhaps we need to rethink how we have worked so far in that area of the world,  he said.

" a federal judge threw out a challenge to a north carolina law that allows government officials to refuse to perform same sex marriages if they cite religious objections, claiming the couples who brought the suit failed to establish they were harmed by the law. the six plaintiffs, who include gay couples, argued in the suit filed in u.s. district court in asheville that the legislation   senate bill 2   allows magistrates and other officials performing marriages to put their personal beliefs before their sworn constitutional duty.  the plaintiffs said on wednesday they would appeal the ruling issued by u.s. district judge max cogburn on tuesday. cogburn said the plaintiffs had not argued they were being directly injured by the law, but instead said that their tax dollars were not being used according to the constitution.  he said they had not presented enough evidence to prove they had been harmed as taxpayers, although he did add that citizens could potentially suffer “real or emotional harm” as a result of the law because the magistrates decision to opt out is secret.  north carolina’s republican led legislature passed the law in 2015 as social conservatives nationwide pushed for so called “religious freedom bills” in response to same sex marriage becoming legal. state legislators overrode republican governor pat mccrory’s veto of the measure the same month the u.s. supreme court legalized gay marriage across the country. data from september 2015 showed at least 32 magistrates across the state have thus far exempted themselves as have register of deeds employees in five counties, according the campaign for southern equality, which supported the suit.   “senate bill 2 expressly declares that magistrates religious beliefs are superior to their oath of judicial office,” said attorney luke largess from tin fulton walker & owen, which represented the couples in the case. “the law spends public money to advance those religious beliefs. that is a straightforward violation of the first amendment.”  the office of north carolina’s attorney general declined to comment on the case, according to spokeswoman noelle talley. magistrates who ask to opt out are barred from performing any marriage, gay or heterosexual, for six months.         the nonprofit group the liberty counsel, which represented a magistrate as an intervenor in the case, said both the u.s. constitution and the north carolina constitution require accommodation of religious beliefs even for government officials.  north carolina has come under fire for another law passed earlier this year that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex.  major sports organizations including the national collegiate athletic association and the national basketball association have moved their competitions from the state to protest the so called bathroom bill.

" the u.s. senate advanced the nomination of former exxon mobil corp (xom.n) chief executive rex tillerson on monday to be president donald trump’s secretary of state, moving closer to filling a key seat on the republican’s national security team despite partisan rancor over trump’s immigration order. the vote was 56 to 43 to move toward a final confirmation vote after up to 30 hours’ debate, putting a final vote very early on wednesday, if senators do not agree to change the time. the vote broke largely along party lines. every republican favored advancing the nomination and all but four members of the democratic caucus voted against it. the senate’s democratic leader, chuck schumer, and several other members of the party tried, but failed, to delay considering tillerson because of trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven mostly muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. they said they wanted to question tillerson more closely on his views on muslim immigration. during his confirmation hearing, the former oil executive said he did not support a “blanket type rejection” of any group of people. democrats said that statement seemed to contradict trump’s order. trump and his supporters, including many republicans, said his order is necessary to keep americans safe and is not intended to ban muslims, despite addressing only muslim majority nations whose citizens have not been involved in attacks on the united states. they said it was important to fill important slots on trump’s national security team quickly. “as we proceed in ensuring the new administration has the leaders it needs to implement our nation’s foreign policy going forward, i have great confidence rex tillerson will serve the united states well,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said.

" the united nations  aviation agency is backing the creation of a single global drone registry, as part of broader efforts to come up with common rules for flying and tracking unmanned aircraft. while the international civil aviation organization cannot impose regulations on countries, icao has proposed formation of the registry during a montreal symposium this month to make data accessible in real time, said stephen creamer, director of icao s air navigation bureau. the single registry would eschew multiple databases in favor of a one stop shop that would allow law enforcement to remotely identify and track unmanned aircraft, along with their operator and owner.  the initiative comes at a time when drone usage is soaring in the united states, europe and china, raising privacy concerns and fears of collisions with commercial jets.    you ve got to have some commonality so that you re not carrying five receivers in your police car,  creamer said in an interview on thursday. it s not yet clear who would operate such a database, although icao could possibly fill that role. the proposal, however, could face push back from users, after hobbyists successfully challenged the creation of a u.s. drone registry by the federal aviation administration in court earlier this year. icao will host the symposium from sept 22 23 on issues like registering and tracking drones, along with geofencing like systems to prevent their operation in restricted areas. the talks will be at an event attended by experts and companies like google, rockwell collins (col.n) and amazon.com (amzn.o), according to the meeting program schedule. montreal headquartered icao, which normally sets standards for international civil aviation that are adopted by its 191 member countries, was asked to assist in the development of more uniform domestic drone regulations because the remotely piloted aircraft are sold and flown globally.  they (drone makers) are worried that europe might create one set of standards, united states might do a second and china might do a third. and they ve got to build a drone differently in these different environments,  creamer said. parimal kopardekar, a principal investigator for unmanned aircraft system traffic management (utm) at the nasa ames research center in california said he supported the drone industry developing around the world with common operating standards.  i think it s smart that icao is trying to harmonize it,  he said by phone.    if you have a drone that you build in one country you should be able to use it in another country and vice versa.

" the mayor and police chief of cleveland next week will outline what security measures they would take for the republican national convention, officials said after a civil rights group and a police union criticized aspects of the preparations.   donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, has drawn intense protests at campaign stops this year. at times the demonstrations have resulted in violence between his supporters and opponents. officials in cleveland are gearing up for the thousands of demonstrators expected outside the convention, scheduled from july 18 to 21. the event will culminate with the party anointing the billionaire real estate developer as its nominee for the november general election. cleveland mayor frank jackson will join the police chief and other city officials on tuesday to present a “comprehensive overview of security preparations” for the convention, the mayor said in a statement. “despite rumors, the division of police is prepared and is on track with its planning goals,” the statement said. the announcement comes after the american civil liberties union on may 19 accused the city of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the convention.  the city has since said it will allow application for permits starting on tuesday, the same day officials will outline security plans. the cleveland police patrolmen’s association also has objected to certain parts of the city’s plan. the union filed a grievance over an order prohibiting officers from taking vacations for several days before and after the convention. that prompted an arbitrator to order the city to pay overtime to officers who would lose out on vacation time, according to a copy of the ruling posted at news website cleveland.com. cleveland officials are marshalling a force of about 5,000 officers, including police from other law enforcement agencies, to provide security for the convention, city council members have said. council members earlier this month raised questions about the lack of transparency in cleveland’s plans for the convention. but police chief calvin williams has said the city must withhold certain information to stymie anyone seeking to disrupt the convention. he has declined to say how many officers will be assigned to the event. protests against trump dogged his appearance on friday in san diego, where more than 1,000 demonstrators turned up and 35 were arrested, and on tuesday night in albuquerque, new mexico, where protesters threw rocks and bottles at police.

" ousted thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra has fled the country ahead of a verdict against her in a negligence trial brought by the junta that overthrew her, sources close to the shinawatra family said on friday. yingluck, 50, whose family has dominated thai politics for more than 15 years, failed to show up at court for judgment in a case centered on the multi billion dollar losses incurred by a rice subsidy scheme for farmers. overthrown in 2014, yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. her former commerce minister was jailed in a related case for 42 years on friday.  she has definitely left thailand,  said one source, who is also a member of her puea thai party. the sources did not say where she had gone. yingluck s brother, thaksin shinawatra, who heads the political clan, was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile to escape a corruption conviction that he said was aimed at demolishing the populist movement he founded. the struggle between that movement and a bangkok centered royalist and pro military elite has been at the heart of years of turmoil in thailand. the verdict against yingluck could have reignited tension, though the army has largely snuffed out open opposition. after yingluck failed to show up, the supreme court issued an arrest warrant against her and rescheduled the verdict to sept. 27. it said it did not believe her excuse that she could not attend the court hearing because of an ear problem.  it is possible that she has fled already,  deputy prime minister prawit wongsuwan told reporters. he later said police were investigating reports that she had left via koh chang, an island close to the cambodian border. cambodian immigration police said she had not entered their country. yingluck last commented on social media on thursday, saying on her facebook page that she would not be able to meet supporters at court because of tight security. she had been banned from traveling abroad at the beginning of the trial in 2015 and has attended previous hearings. the court confiscated the 30 million baht ($900,000) that yingluck had posted as bail. hundreds of her supporters had gathered outside the court on friday where about 4,000 police had been deployed. some held roses while others wore white gloves with the word  love  on them. although yingluck had already been banned from politics by the junta in 2015, she could have been a party figurehead for elections that junta leader prime minister prayuth chan ocha has promised for next year. if yingluck has fled it would disappoint her supporters and make her opponents feel vindicated, said thitinan pongsudhirak, director of the institute of security and international studies at chulalongkorn university.  it does not help with thailand s division and polarization,  he said. under the rice subsidy program, yingluck s administration paid rice farmers up to 50 percent more than market prices. it left thailand with huge rice stockpiles and caused $8 billion in losses. yingluck has said she was only in charge of coming up with the policy but not the day to day management of it.  if she has fled people would not trust her, but the masses would still support her because they benefited from her policies,  38 year old delivery man sakunchai muenlamai. the supreme court sentenced yingluck s former commerce minister, boonsong teriyapirom, to 42 years in jail after finding him guilty of falsifying government to government rice deals between thailand and china in 2013. he said he would appeal, but was told it was too late in the day to apply for bail so will spend the weekend behind bars.

" u.s. senator rand paul of kentucky said he returned to work on monday, more than a week after he suffered six broken ribs when tackled by a neighbor while mowing his lawn. “while i’m still in a good deal of pain, i will be returning to work in the senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks,” the republican senator paul said on a twitter post. the man accused of tackling paul and breaking his ribs, rene boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said. boucher is charged with fourth degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. a pretrial hearing was set for nov. 30.  boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep at least 1,000 feet (305 m) away from paul remained in effect. paul, 54, told police that boucher came on his property in a gated community near bowling green and tackled him from behind, the bowling green daily news reported, citing an arrest warrant. paul previously said on twitter he suffered the broken ribs from the nov. 3 incident and that x rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest. media reports have said boucher, also a physician like paul, had a long running dispute with the senator. but paul, in a washington examiner interview published monday, said he had no dispute with boucher and had not spoken to his neighbor in a decade. he said he knew of no motive for the incident. paul could not be reached by reuters monday. “my first encounter was basically being hit in the back,” he said. “we’ve never had words over anything, we’ve never had a dispute or discussion or words.” the kentucky state police and the federal bureau of investigation are investigating the incident, according to warren county attorney amy milliken. citing unnamed sources, fox news reported on thursday that paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case. “there is going to be a criminal prosecution,” paul told the examiner but did not elaborate on what he meant. there are no updates on the federal charges, david habich, an fbi spokesman in louisville, said in an email on monday. the senator’s office declined to comment on possible federal charges on monday.

" the 40,000 year old remains of an aboriginal man that prompted a drastic rewrite of australian history were returned to his ancestral homeland on friday after four decades of examination in the country s capital. the discovery of  mungo man  in 1974, named after the dry outback lakebed where the fully intact skeleton was found, doubled the known length of humans  presence on the continent from 20,000 to 40,000 years. but the bones  removal to canberra for study, roughly 600 km (370 miles) east of lake mungo, had angered the indigenous community there.  we ve been waiting all those years to get him back and i m so glad he is back, to put him in his resting place,  said joan slade, an elder of the aboriginal ngiyampaa people at a ceremony welcoming the remains back to her ancestral country. the skeleton, along with 104 other remains, arrived in a black hearse with the black, yellow and red aboriginal flag painted on its side. a traditional smoking ceremony, with green gum leaves burned over a small fire, welcomed the remains back to the red soil and saltbush scrub of lake mungo.      this, today, is one of those catalytic moments...it makes us, the traditional owners, custodians of our culture,  said elder michael young.  they will be kept in a secret, safe place so that we can pass on to the next generations the legacy that these people have given us.       though subsequent discoveries have pushed back even further the date of humans  first arrival in australia, the finding of mungo man was at the time a huge advance for understanding human history.     his burial, with limbs stretched out, hands crossed across his groin and covered in an ochre drawn from some 200 km away, helped prove the ancient age of aboriginal civilization   the world s oldest continuing culture   dating back around the time neanderthals occupied europe. the australian national university, whose researchers removed the remains, issued a formal apology when it turned the remains over to the region s aboriginal custodians in 2015.  we recognise that the removal of these ancestral remains caused ongoing grief to your communities and we apologise unreservedly,  it said.   while the research undertaken...contributed significantly to the understanding of the history of indigenous australians, our research in the past has not always been undertaken with your full knowledge and support.

" at least 200 muslims have fled their village in the western indian state of rajasthan after a hindu priest and his friends were alleged to have killed a muslim folk singer late last month, police said on wednesday. trouble erupted in dantal village near the india pakistan border on sept. 27, when a hindu priest accused folk singer ahmad khan of making mistakes while reciting hymns to evoke a hindu goddess. khan, 45, was a member of the langa manganiyar community that has been singing hindu religious songs and spiritual verses in temples and at festivals for generations. the priest suggested changes to the hymn, leading to an argument. police said the priest, ramesh suthar, and his friends then broke khan s musical instruments and killed him.  the news of the murder triggered unrest between hindus and muslims who have been living together for generations,  said gaurav yadav, a senior police officer investigating the case. he did not say how khan was killed, but said suthar had been arrested. the priest s accomplices had fled, yadav said. two of suthar s family members said he was in shock and refused to talk about the case. government authorities had sent paramilitary forces to the area but the muslims, fearing clashes, refused to return home.  for one small mistake the hindus killed my brother,  said rakha khan, the dead singer s cousin.  we can t live in the same village ever again.  rakha khan said they had sought refuge in a school and that the state government office and other local authorities were providing them with food. the attack is the latest in a series of incidents targeting the minority muslim community in states ruled by prime minister narendra modi s hindu nationalist party. since his bharatiya janata party came to power in 2014, hardline hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows. many hindus believe cows are sacred and killing them is banned in some states.

" u.s. president donald trump’s middle east envoy and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu met on monday, netanyahu’s office said, as the new administration tries to restart peace talks with the palestinians. a statement from the israeli leader’s office said jason greenblatt “reaffirmed president trump’s commitment to israel’s security and to the effort to help israelis and palestinians achieve a lasting peace through direct negotiations.” peace talks between israel and the palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and the palestinians have been concerned at the more favorable approach shown by washington toward netanyahu since trump came to office in january. the statement added that during a conversation lasting more than five hours, netanyahu and greenblatt discussed israel’s settlement building “with the hope of reaching a formula that will aim to promote peace and security.”  one of the most heated issues between israel and the palestinians is israel’s building of settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem, territory the palestinians want for their own future state along with the gaza strip. on friday, trump spoke to palestinian president mahmoud abbas and invited him to the white house. it was the first phone call between the two leaders since trump took office. greenblatt is set to meet abbas in the west bank on tuesday. the israeli statement added that “greenblatt stressed how important enabling the growth of the palestinian economy and improving the quality of life for palestinians are to president trump.” before taking office, trump named greenblatt, his company’s top lawyer, as his special negotiator for trade deals and other talks and his adviser to the middle east and special representative for international negotiations.

"apparently the only thing the national rifle association and the white house can agree on is that president obama would smoke them in a debate on gun control.cnn extended an invitation to the nra, the nation s most powerful gun lobby, to join obama during a live town hall on thursday evening in virginia to discuss the issue of gun violence. they gracelessly declined.nra spokesman andrew arulanandam seemed willing to assume the nra would come out of the debate looking very badly. he claimed the white house would rig the event and turn it into a  public relations spectacle. in other words, the nra believes it would lose and arulanandam is desperate to think of a good excuse as to why that is.undermining this excuse, however, is the fact that it is cnn, not obama, that is organizing the event.a cnn spokesperson said that it was the network, not the white house, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the second amendment including nra members as well as groups that back gun regulation.the only ones too afraid to show up to this mixed crowd are nra representatives.and while it s laughable that the nra already threw in the towel before the debate even began, they are justified in being worried about what they would face if they were brave enough to show up. as obama proved numerous times during his two presidential elections, he s a formidable debate opponent. it is also clear that the issue of gun control is an area that obama is fired up about. for years, republicans in washington and their pro-gun benefactors have stymied any and all attempts to address mass shootings. entering his last year in office, obama is done playing games. earlier this week, he gave an emotional and powerful speech about the need for better gun control   and what he plans to do about it. each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  obama said.  i reject that thinking. we know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. but maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  he added.the nra seems content to fight against any conceivable campaign to stop needless gun violence. this includes floating reckless lies that obama is a tyrant seizing people s guns. on social media, the lobbying group regularly promotes misinformation to its gullible followers. they aren t used to being called out on it.now that it is time to actually face obama, it s no wonder they can t do it.feature image via gage skidmore/flickr",1
" a booby trapped motorbike exploded in the northeastern syrian city of qamishli on monday, killing a child and wounding six other people, the monitoring group syrian observatory for human rights reported. syrian state tv said a motorbike had exploded and reported that four people were wounded but did not immediately mention deaths. qamishli is in an area mostly under the control of kurdish security forces. bomb blasts, often claimed by islamic state, have occurred in qamishli and nearby hasaka city, both under kurdish control, but have been rare in the last year. islamic state also reported the bombing via its online amaq news agency, saying it had targeted a vehicle belonging to kurdish security forces. it did not explicitly claim the attack. kurdish internal security force the asayish, in a statement, blamed a syrian government allied paramilitary group for carrying out the attack. the kurdish ypg militia is spearheading a u.s. backed offensive to drive islamic state out of the jihadist group s remaining strongholds in eastern syria, including its former de facto syrian capital, raqqa. the ypg and syrian government forces have mostly stayed out of each other s way in the six year old syrian conflict.

" north korea probably stole south korean warship blueprints after hacking into daewoo shipbuilding & marine engineering co ltd s (042660.ks) database in april last year, a south korean opposition lawmaker said on tuesday.  north korea has often been implicated in cyber attacks in south korea and elsewhere but pyongyang has either ignored or denied accusations of hacking.   we are almost 100 percent certain that north korean hackers were behind the hacking and stole the company s sensitive documents,  kyung dae soo of the main opposition liberty korea party told reuters by telephone.  daewoo shipbuilding has built several south korean warships, including an aegis class vessel and submarines. it was most likely north korea had obtained blueprints for these, he said.  the hacking was discovered by a division under south korea s ministry of defence in charge of investigating cases of cybercrime, said kyung, who received a briefing on the investigation.  how sensitive and classified the seized documents were was not known as that was not disclosed by the investigative team, he added.  a spokeswoman for daewoo shipbuilding said she was unaware of the issue until early tuesday and the company was in the process of confirming the details of kyung s remarks.  the investigative team came to the conclusion north korea had hacked daewoo shipbuilding because the hacking method was very similar to other attacks that north korea was thought to be behind, kyung said.  hackers in north korea are believed to have been responsible for a recent cyber heist in taiwan   the latest in a string of hacks targeting the global swift messaging system.  earlier this month, another south korean lawmaker had said north korean hackers had stolen a large number of classified military documents, including south korea u.s. wartime operational plans.  and british authorities said last week they believed north korea was behind the  wannacry  ransomware attack in may that disrupted businesses and government services worldwide, including the national health service in england.

" legal advocacy groups seeking to challenge president donald trump in court over alleged conflicts of interest said filing lawsuits is part of a larger strategy to highlight their concerns and put political pressure on the white house. in a lawsuit on monday, ethics watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington contended payments to trump’s businesses for hotel rooms and office leases run afoul of the emoluments clause of the constitution, which forbids u.s. officeholders from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  trump on monday called the lawsuit “without merit,” and legal experts have noted significant barriers to success in court, such as whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue.  the american civil liberties union is also preparing a lawsuit over trump’s alleged violations of the emoluments clause, said aclu executive director anthony romero. beyond winning favorable rulings, cases can serve to “gum up the machinery of the government and rob the trump administration of momentum,” he said.  lawsuits can also serve to frame the public debate and gain the attention of congress and government officials, romero said.  “this should be an area where we let a thousand legal flowers bloom,” he told reuters on tuesday.  laurence tribe, one of the attorneys representing crew, said the purpose of its lawsuit was to force trump to abide by the constitution, and that he felt confident they would achieve a favorable outcome in court.  he also said bringing the case can accomplish other goals.  “one of the things that this lawsuit will achieve is increased public understanding of what the issue is,” he said. aside from the emoluments clause, conflict of interest laws that govern the executive branch generally do not apply to the president or vice president, said erwin chemerinsky, dean of uc irvine school of law and another of crew’s lawyers. presidents largely enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties.  the office of government ethics sets policy for executive branch employees, but it does not investigate complaints or bring lawsuits. if oge officials find evidence of wrongdoing, they refer it to the department of justice for civil or criminal prosecution.   crew also filed a complaint with the general services administration over trump’s hotel in washington d.c., which he leases from the federal government. the complaint alleges the business violates the terms of the lease, which says it cannot be held by an elected officeholder. it is unclear whether that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts.  federal courts maintain strict rules about who has the legal right, or standing, to sue. the u.s. department of justice will likely raise a standing challenge to crew’s case in the form of a motion to dismiss, said deepak gupta, another attorney representing the group.  a spokeswoman for the department of justice said it is reviewing the complaint and would respond as appropriate.  in its lawsuit, crew argued that it should be allowed to bring the emoluments case because it has been forced to spend money and divert resources away from its traditional agenda of tracking campaign contributions and ethics monitoring. legal experts have said that will be a difficult argument to win. tribe, a professor at harvard law school, said crew felt confident it would win on standing. he also noted that additional plaintiffs “have expressed interest in bringing litigation, either as part of our case or others.” he declined to identify them or discuss strategy details. romero also said the aclu is seeking a “suitable plaintiff.” andy grewal, a professor at the university of iowa college of law, said that adding a plaintiff with more concrete allegations, such as a hotel that claims it has lost business to trump’s hotels, would still be an uphill battle.  it would be hard to prove, for instance, that a diplomat would have stayed at another hotel instead of trump’s, he said. ultimately, no court has determined whether ownership by a president or government official of a corporation that sells products to a foreign government would violate the constitution, he said, and that could present an additional barrier to success.

" billionaire carl icahn will advise donald trump on rescinding what the activist investor called “excessive regulation” on u.s. businesses, the president elect’s transition team announced on wednesday. icahn will serve as a special adviser, not a federal employee, and he will not have specific duties, trump’s team said in a statement. he will not take a salary, a transition aide said. the pick could draw scrutiny because icahn, whose major investments include insurer american international group and oil refining business cvr energy, could help shape rules meant to police wall street and protect the environment. in the transition team statement released on wednesday, icahn said it was time to “break free of excessive regulation” and let businesses create jobs. icahn, an early supporter of trump’s white house bid who has at times been outspoken about regulation, has already helped the transition team weigh candidates to lead the securities and exchange commission. he has held meetings at his new york city office, not far from trump tower but away from reporters staked out there, people familiar with the talks said.  current sec chair mary jo white will leave in january. candidates to replace her have included former sec commissioner paul atkins and debra wong yang, a former federal prosecutor, a source familiar with the matter said. over the years, icahn’s businesses have had occasional regulatory run ins, according to disclosures with the financial industry regulatory authority. he is a large investor in nutrition supplement maker herbalife, which said at one time it was investigated by the sec.      “voters who wanted trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud,” democratic national committee spokesman eric walker said in a statement, referring to trump’s pledge to clean up washington.     icahn, who was once known as a corporate raider, said in a recent reuters interview the 2010 dodd frank banking law “went too far.” he is a critic of the u.s. biofuels program that requires oil companies to use renewable fuels such as ethanol. “i do believe that, to some extent, we have gone overboard concerning the environment. but i leave that to the experts in that area,” icahn told cnn in a recent interview. trump and icahn share some history in the casino business. icahn this year helped shutter the trump taj mahal casino resorts in atlantic city, two years after buying it out of bankruptcy. the casino was once a prized part of trump’s empire.

" mexico and central american countries they will lobby u.s. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on tuesday after u.s. president donald trump said he would end a program that shields them from deportation.  trump announced plans to halt the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young men and women who entered the united states illegally as children. mexico s deputy foreign minister, carlos sada, said trump s decision created  anxiety, anguish and fear  for the roughly 625,000 mexican nationals protected under the program.  they are exceptional. ... this is as emotional for the united states as for mexico,  sada said at a news conference immediately following the announcement to end the program.  he said his government would press u.s. lawmakers for a quick solution to the uncertainty that  dreamers,  as they are commonly called, now face in their adopted home. immigrants who opt to return to mexico will be welcomed with  open arms,  sada said, offering them assistance with work, finances and education. the announcement to end daca, created by former president barack obama in a 2012 executive order, came during the final day of talks in the mexican capital to modernize the north american free trade agreement, adding pressure to already tense conversations between mexico and the united states. el salvador s foreign relations minister, hugo martinez, said he would meet with u.s. congress members to find a solution within the next six months, before daca s provisions are set to end, aiming to protect the 30,000 to 60,000 salvadorans who could be affected.  it s a worrisome situation. ... we will be lobbying to have legislation as soon as possible that opens a way out,  martinez said. guatemala s foreign relations ministry said in a statement that it is counting on the  humanitarian sensibilities  of u.s. lawmakers to ensure thousands of guatemalans are not forced to leave the country where many grew up. honduras said in a statement that it would push u.s. congress to reconsider trump s move, and offer consular support for more than 18,500 hondurans protected by daca. the director of a honduras migrant aid center, the center for attention for honduran migrants, called the u.s. decision  very sad,  and said young hondurans forced to return home could face violence from gangs and drug traffickers.  their lives will be much more difficult and put at enormous risk,  said valdette willeman, the center s director.

" a coalition of supporters of self driving cars said on tuesday that it will run ads this week in social media and washington newspapers, in an effort to convince the u.s. congress to adopt sweeping legislation to boost the nascent industry. the ads are being placed by the coalition for future mobility, which was formed in july by trade groups representing major automakers, along with other advocates for self driving cars, as congress began serious consideration of bills relating to autonomous vehicles. they want the senate to pass a bill that would speed up the use of self driving cars by easing safety regulations, and bar states from blocking such vehicles. the house of representatives has already unanimously approved a bill. the senate is considering a similar draft measure, but is divided over whether to include large commercial trucks, a dispute that could prevent the bill from winning approval this year.  the house measure, which only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg), would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. the cap would rise over three years to 100,000 vehicles annually. as part of the campaign, major automakers will be contacting their employees and retirees, asking them to reach out to their members of congress, a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers said. the coalition launched a website and will use targeted facebook advertising, focusing on groups who could benefit from autonomous vehicles, such as disabled veterans. one of the print ads seen by reuters features a man dressed in military fatigues sitting in a wheelchair. the ad says: “he fought for our freedom. let’s give him back his.” that “will only become a reality if congress acts,” the ad says. the coalition includes trade groups representing automakers general motors co, toyota motor corp and volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de), as well as organizations including ride sharing firm lyft inc, the telecommunications industry association, the american council of the blind and a drone industry group.      senate aides have been negotiating in recent days but have not reached agreement. a senate panel could take up the issue at an oct. 4 hearing, aides say. auto industry leaders say 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self driving vehicles replaced human drivers. self driving proponents say 94 percent of u.s. car crashes are the result of human error and argue self driving cars could dramatically cut the 35,000 annual road deaths.

" u.s. sen. john mccain on monday announced that he will support an upcoming effort by his fellow republicans to win senate confirmation of judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court by changing the chamber’s rules in order to overcome democratic opposition. mccain, in remarks to reporters, said he had “no choice” but to go along with a change in rules ending a tradition of 60 votes in the 100 member senate needed to advance supreme court nominees to a final vote. he said he would support the rule change “because we need to confirm gorsuch.” in the past, mccain has strongly opposed such a change.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin on friday said he expects to publish a much anticipated review of the financial stability oversight council (fsoc) ahead of a review of special rules that would allow regulators to step in and unwind a troubled lender.  the fsoc comprises the country’s major financial regulators and oversees the designation of large financial firms as systemically important, a process banks have criticized as too opaque.  the “orderly liquidation authority” or ola, introduced by the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law, gives u.s. regulators the power to step in and liquidate a troubled bank instead of putting it through a traditional bankruptcy. many republicans say ola powers are excessive, while many leaders of the banking industry defend the powers.

" house of representatives speaker paul ryan urged president donald trump on friday not to rescind an obama era program that protects immigrants who entered the united states illegally as children, as more republicans lined up against the move. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will announce on tuesday whether he will end the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, program, which protects nearly 800,000 young men and women from deportation. it also makes those covered, so called dreamers, eligible for work permits. “we love the ‘dreamers,’” the republican president, already facing calls from leading business figures and democrats to preserve the program, told reporters in the oval office, without tipping his hand on the decision. ryan and senator orrin hatch on friday joined a small but growing number of lawmakers from the party that controls congress and the white house to speak out against killing daca, created in 2012 by democratic former president barack obama and long the target of conservative immigration hard liners. “i actually don’t think he should do that, and i believe that this is something congress has to fix,” ryan said in an interview with wclo radio in his hometown of janesville, wisconsin. ryan said he believes obama exceeded his authority in creating daca by executive order, bypassing congress, but there now are “people who are in limbo.”  “these are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don’t know another home. and so i really do believe that there needs to be a legislative solution. that’s one that we’re working on. and i think we want to give people peace of mind,” ryan added. nancy pelosi, the top house democrat, said she was “heartened” by ryan’s comments and asked him to meet with democratic lawmakers next week to discuss a “comprehensive legislative solution.” hatch said in a statement rescinding the program would further complicate a u.s. immigration system sorely in need of legislative reform. “like the president, i’ve long advocated for tougher enforcement of our existing immigration laws. but we also need a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here. and that solution must come from congress,” the longest serving republican senator added. tennessee’s republican attorney general, herbert slatery, said his office will not participate in a lawsuit challenging daca that is expected to be filed by a group of republican state attorneys general next week, and urged congress to pursue a legislative fix. “many of the daca recipients, some of whose records i reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country,” slatery wrote in a letter to tennessee’s two republican u.s. senators. about 200 dreamers and their supporters turned out on friday for a rally in downtown los angeles to urge national leaders not to end the program.   among them was docnary reyes, 21, who came to the united states from guatemala with her parents in 1997 when she was a toddler. before obtaining daca in 2014, reyes had to work under the table cleaning apartments, she said. her work authorization allowed her to obtain a paid internship last year working on a project involving cyanobacteria. the los angeles resident will continue her education at the university of california, davis, to study environmental restoration.  “i feel like i really care about our environment and not enough people do,” reyes said. trump made a crackdown on illegal immigrants a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign and has stepped up deportations since taking office in january. but business leaders say immigrants make important economic contributions and that ending the program would hit economic growth and tax revenue. leading business figures including facebook inc (fb.o) ceo mark zuckerberg have rallied in defense of the program and the dreamers. congress under presidents of both parties has been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform. spokeswoman sanders said trump, who previously has called daca illegal, is not taking the decision lightly.  “the president’s priorities on immigration are to create a system that encourages legal immigration and benefits our economy and american workers,” sanders told a news briefing. most of the dreamer immigrants came from mexico and other latin american countries. more than 200,000 live in california, while 100,000 are in texas. new york, illinois and florida also have large numbers. what to do about dreamers has been actively debated within the white house and trump administration. one senior administration official described the debate as a “tug of war” between factions in favor and against the move. daca supporters argue that the people it protects grew up and were educated in the united states and were integrated into american society, with little connection to the countries in which they are citizens. opponents of the program argue that illegal immigrants take jobs from u.s. citizens.  there are deep divisions in the united states over the fate of roughly 11 million illegal immigrants, most of them hispanics. trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them. undoing daca could have political consequences for trump and his fellow republicans, further alienating hispanics, a growing voting bloc in the united states. trump’s pardon for an arizona sheriff who critics accused of targeting hispanics, his planned wall along the u.s. mexican border and his comments about mexico sending “rapists” and drug dealers into the united states already had antagonized many hispanic americans.

" the mother and sister of a prominent critic of rwanda s president said on friday all three of them had been tortured and deprived of food as they were held in jail on charges of forgery and inciting insurrection. adeline rwigara told a court she and her daughters were handcuffed day and night. she is being held alongside her daughter diane shima rwigara, a 35 year old accountant who tried to stand against president paul kagame in august elections. diane rwigara, who is accused of faking the registration papers for the election, was eventually barred from running and kagame went on to win with 98.8 percent of the vote. she has repeatedly accused kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his rwandan patriotic front s tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end rwanda s 1994 genocide.  kagame has repeatedly denied cracking down on dissent. justice minister johnston busingye on friday declined to comment of the torture allegations, saying they were a matter for the court.  since august 29, i and my children were tortured,  adeline told the panel of three judges.  we were handcuffed day and night, without eating or drinking,  adeline said, adding they had once gone without food and medication for a week. diane s younger sister anne said the family has also been kept in solitary confinement.  imagine staying in a closed room for 24 hours without access to fresh air. at least allow us to bask in the sun for 30 minutes and be visited,  she said. diane rwigara was in court but did not speak. their lawyer buhuru pierre celestin told the court that their confinement violated international conventions. in response, prosecutors told the court that the defendants  rights were respected, without commenting on the torture allegations. on tuesday, human rights watch said the government routinely and unlawfully detained and tortured detainees with beatings, asphyxiations, mock executions and electric shocks. asked by reuters to respond to rwigara s torture accusations, minister of justice johnston busingye said:  issues raised in court are determined by the court. if there is a claim of torture in court, the court is the proper place to examine it and determine what happened.  the trial will resume on monday.

" the united states has called on the u.n. security council to  blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on north korea, documents showed on tuesday, while south korea s president suggested delaying military exercises with washington to ease tensions ahead of next year s winter olympics. documents seen by reuters said the 10 vessels had been conducting ship to ship transfers of refined petroleum products to north korean vessels or transporting north korean coal in violation of u.n. sanctions imposed over pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. the ships would be blacklisted   meaning countries would be required to ban them from entering their ports   if none of the 15 members of the security council s north korea sanctions committee object by thursday afternoon. north korea is under a u.n. arms embargo and the security council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs.  in september, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to north korea. the ships targeted for blacklisting were xin sheng hai (flag unknown); the hong kong flagged lighthouse winmore; the togo flagged yu yuan; panama flagged glory hope 1 (also known as orient shenyu), kai xiang, and billions no. 18; and the north korean flagged ul ji bong 6, rung ra 2, rye song gang 1, and sam jong 2. four ships were designated for carrying coal from north korea by the council s north korea sanctions committee in october. the united states has led a drive to step up sanctions on north korea in response to pyongyang s efforts to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states. in ottawa on tuesday, canada and the united states said they would co host a foreign ministers meeting in vancouver on jan. 16 to demonstrate international solidarity against north korea s nuclear and missile tests. representatives of the countries that sent troops or other military support to the u.n. backed effort to repel north korean forces after the 1950 invasion of south korea will attend. japan, india and sweden will also attend, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said.  we can t talk unless north korea is ready to talk,  tillerson told reporters after meeting with canadian foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland.  what s important for north korea to know is that this pressure campaign will not abate, we will not be rolling any of it back, it will only be intensified as time goes by, and it will remain in place until they agree to give up their nuclear weapons and allow us to verify the fact that is what they have done,  he said. freeland said the world had to demonstrate to north korea that it was united in condemning pyongyang s actions.  the international pressure campaign   we believe it s going to be successful, and a successful outcome of the international pressure campaign is a diplomatic engagement,  freeland said. washington has warned that all options are on the table, including military ones, to prevent north korea s missile development. on friday, tillerson had urged north korea to carry out a  sustained cessation  of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks. north korea paused its missile testing for more than two months before firing a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile in late november. u.s. officials say it has given no indication it is willing to discuss giving up its nuclear program and pyongyang has repeatedly denounced u.s. and south korean military drills, which it says are a prelude to invasion. on tuesday, south korean president moon jae in said he was willing to ease tensions ahead of next year s winter olympics in south korea by delaying joint military exercises.  it is possible for south korea and the u.s. to review the possibility of postponing the exercises,  he told nbc news.   i ve made such a suggestion to the u.s., and the u.s. is currently reviewing it. however, all this depends on how north korea behaves.  a spokesman for the u.s. pacific command, commander dave benham, declined to discuss any plans for exercises. earlier on tuesday, japan and south korea, both u.s. allies, urged china to put more pressure on north korea. japanese foreign minister taro kono said after talks with south korean foreign minister kang kyung wha that china   north korea s neighbor and only big ally   was implementing security council resolutions but could do more. china routinely says it is meeting its u.n. obligations on north korea and has urged  all sides  to pursue dialogue. the u.s. navy s top officer, chief of naval operations admiral john richardson, said on tuesday that vessels from the eastern pacific could be moved to reinforce u.s. naval power in asia as washington contends with increased threats in the region and accidents that have weakened its maritime force. china has been irritated by stepped up u.s. naval deployments in the pacific and along with russia has proposed that washington and seoul halt major military exercises in exchange for north korea freezing its weapons programs. washington has warned north korea it would be  totally destroyed  in the event of war and on monday u.s. president donald trump unveiled a new national security strategy stressing the need to deal with the challenge posed by pyongyang. this week washington publicly blamed north korea for a massive worldwide cyber attack in may that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies. a white house official said on tuesday that facebook inc and microsoft corp disabled a number of north korean cyber threats last week. researchers say a series of cyber attacks has netted north korean hackers millions of dollars in virtual currencies like bitcoin, with more attacks expected, as international sanctions drive the country to seek new sources of cash.

" colombia s farc rebel group included footwear and orange juicers in the list of assets it will hand over for victim reparations, drawing ire on thursday from officials who maintain the guerrillas have extensive criminal wealth and sparking the government to announce a special verification commission. the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) agreed under a 2016 peace deal with the government to hand over all funds and property to pay reparations to victims of forced disappearance, rape, displacement, kidnapping and land mines. the group has for decades extorted landowners and business people, earned ransoms from hostage takings and sold coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, to drug traffickers. officials said on thursday that the list, which was originally given to the united nations and has not been made public, included many items that have little or no monetary value and made a mockery of victims.  pots, orange juicers, lemon juicers, plates, boots, which will be depreciated and don t have a commercial value and which above all will not be a source of reparation for victims,  attorney general nestor humberto martinez told journalists. martinez added the full list should be released. the list will be reviewed by a special commission in a bid to find missing assets, verify their origin and decide how they will be managed, the government said later on thursday.   those assets which have not been inventoried and are later discovered will obligatorily mean punishment and an ordinary justice procedure against members of the farc,  justice minister enrique gil said. all assets will be directed toward victims  reparation, interior minister guillermo rivera added, and not to reintegration programs for the farc fighters themselves. colombian officials have previously accused the farc of possessing large amounts of cash, as well as ranches, businesses and luxury homes, including some located abroad. a lawyer representing the farc, enrique santiago, told local radio that the group had not earned an income in years and had to spend extensively to maintain its more than 7,000 fighters, after calling off kidnappings and extortion during peace talks. the rebels finished handing over more than 8,000 weapons to the u.n., which oversaw their demobilization, earlier this month. on sunday the group will kick off a conference that looks set to cement its transition into a political party.

" british singer adele made clear on monday that she has not given permission for anyone to use her music for political campaigns. adele’s spokesman issued a statement after republican u.s. presidential contender donald trump played adele’s 2011 hit song “rolling in the deep” at rallies in iowa, and mike huckabee released a youtube parody last week of her 2015 single “hello.” “adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning,” the singer’s spokesman said in an email. the spokesman did not say whether adele, whose new album “25” was the biggest seller in the united states last year, was contemplating legal steps to prevent the unauthorized use of her music. adele is far from the only pop or rock star to have seen politicians co opt their music for political purposes. rock band r.e.m. lashed out in september at trump for using its hit song, “it’s the end of the world” at a rally, and frankie sullivan complained about the use of the band’s 1982 hit “eye of the tiger,” at a news conference in september featuring kim davis, a county clerk in kentucky briefly jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses.

" australia s high court began a three day hearing on tuesday to determine the eligibility of seven lawmakers who may hold dual citizenship, a case that could determine whether the government is able to maintain its razor thin majority. australia s parliament was rocked by revelations in august that the seven politicians, including the deputy prime minister and two other cabinet members in prime minister malcolm turnbull s coalition government, are dual citizens. that means they are potentially ineligible to hold elected office under australia s constitution. turnbull s unpopular center right government holds just a one seat majority in parliament, meaning its future could rest on the outcome of the citizenship crisis. the seven lawmakers accept they were dual nationals at the time of their election last year but the government argues that five of them, including all three cabinet members, should be cleared because they were unaware that they had contravened the constitutional requirement at the time. australian solicitor general stephen donaghue urged the seven justices of the high court not to interpret the constitution literally. donaghue said instead the constitution should only disqualify politicians if they had prior knowledge that they may be dual citizens but did not take  reasonable steps  to investigate and renounce their second citizenship where needed. a ruling could come as soon as thursday. should the high court rule deputy prime minister barnaby joyce, the sole lower house lawmaker caught up in the crisis, is ineligible, turnbull will then need to win the support of one of three independent lawmakers to keep his minority government. joyce acquired dual citizenship from his new zealand born father. he said in a submission to the court he believed that his father had renounced his new zealand citizenship before he was born. he did not know until he was 10 that his father was still a new zealand citizen, joyce said. turnbull s government is already in a minority in the upper house senate and, should the high court disqualify all seven lawmakers, he will face a government reshuffle after losing two more cabinet members who are senators. support for turnbull continues to languish near a six month low, but political analysts believe he might receive a boost if he is able to win passage of a same sex marriage bill. turnbull s government won high court approval last month to stage a non binding postal survey on the issue, which is widely popular among australians. results of that poll will be announced on nov. 15.

" france opened a counter terrorism inquiry after a man wielding a knife attacked a soldier in a paris subway station on friday, the latest incident targeting troops protecting the capital s transport hubs and tourist sites. paris and other european capitals are on high alert after a wave of attacks in past years by islamist militants, many of them inspired by islamic state. the paris incident occurred hours before several people were hurt at a london underground station. witnesses reported a blast which police were treating as a terrorism incident.  the assailant in paris was wrestled to the ground and arrested. the soldier, part of operation sentinel, a force deployed in the wake of lethal islamist attacks on france, escaped unhurt. police said the attack happened just before 6.30 a.m. (0430 gmt) as the morning rush hour got under way at the chatelet subway station, where tens of thousands of commuters converge from paris s sprawling suburbs every day. government spokesman christophe castaner said the investigation was being handled by counter terrorism specialists.  a source close to the investigation said the assailant was moroccan born and about 40 years old, with no known criminal background. police raids at an address linked to the suspect were ongoing, the source added.  there have been more than half a dozen attacks against troops belonging to operation sentinel. in early august, a man rammed his car into a group of soldiers on patrol in the wealthy paris suburb of levallois perret.  france announced on thursday that the 7,000 strong force was being adapted to make it more mobile and its movements less predictable. days earlier, interior minister gerard collomb said security agencies had thwarted several bigger plots this year, including one plan to strike a paris night club in late august.  islamist militants have killed more than 230 people in a wave of attacks on french soil since early 2015 and dozens more have been killed in attacks in london, manchester and brussels. french war planes have carried out bombing raids against islamic state strongholds in syria and iraq and the militant group has urged its followers to target france.  french media said the chatelet aggressor shouted references to islamic state as he attacked the soldier.

" chancellor angela merkel said the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion, adding u.s. president donald trump’s order to restrict people from seven muslim majority countries from entering the united states violates the spirit of international cooperation. “the necessary and decisive battle against terrorism does not in any way justify putting groups of certain people under general suspicion — in this case people of muslim belief or of a certain origin,” merkel told a news conference in berlin. “in my opinion, this act runs contrary to the basic principles of international refugee help and international cooperation,” she said. “the chancellery and the foreign ministry will do everything they can, especially for those dual citizens affected, to clear up the legal ramifications and to emphatically represent their interests under the law.” she added: “we’re clearly having close consultations with our european partners about this entire issue.” ",0
" within minutes of jeb bush dropping out of the presidential race saturday night, some of his donors were preparing to throw their financial support behind marco rubio, who has emerged as the strongest candidate among the establishment wing of the party. “jeb’s network is already naturally migrating to marco,” said gaylord hughey, a top bush fundraiser from texas, echoing what four other top donors told reuters. “it’s the clear path.” “it’s a stampede,” added another donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to give bush some time after dropping out before he went public with his support of rubio, the u.s. senator from florida. three other bush donors, who declined to be named, also said they now planned to support rubio.   although he has failed to win any of the first three nominating contests, rubio is considered by many political strategists as the best positioned to challenge frontrunner donald trump, a billionaire political outsider, and senator ted cruz of texas, who has campaigned on an anti washington message. the likelihood that some of bush’s deep pocketed donors will back rubio comes at an opportune time for his candidacy, as he heads into a series of contests in march that will be crucial for building momentum. brian ballard, who raised money for bush last year but switched allegiances last summer to rubio, said: “it’s flooding tonight. ninety five percent of jeb’s money is going to end up with marco.”  rubio had only $5 million in cash on hand at the end of january, federal campaign finance reports released saturday night show, a slim buffer by modern campaign standards.  conservative solutions, a political spending group that supports his campaign, had $5.6 million on hand at the end of january, but spent an additional $9.3 million on advertising in the first 19 days of february.  by contrast, right to rise, bush’s political spending group,  had $24.5 million on hand at the end of january but spent $6.6 million of that in february on ads. and his network of donors have proven their financial might, helping bush at one point to amass a war chest of $150 million. even before bush dropped out, some donors privately complained about the missteps of the campaign, expressing concern about the strength of trump’s candidacy and bush’s lackluster debate performances.  in january, a dozen top bush donors interviewed by reuters said they were angry that bush was using their money to lob attack ads at rubio, damaging the candidate they thought had the best chance to win.  they also said they had privately signaled to the rubio campaign that they would support him once bush dropped out. but they wouldn’t go public at the time because they feared displeasing the bush dynasty.       in addition to the bush money, rubio is expected to reap the support of the billionaire industrialist koch brothers and their donor network, which is expected to spend $400 million in the presidential race, according to several network donors and koch political organization officials.  the koch brothers are also in the midst of planning efforts to undercut trump’s candidacy, network officials and members said at a recent private retreat in california. their focus group research has shown that when voters learn more about how trump’s past business behavior has hurt ordinary people, they sour on him, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

" outlining a new strategy for the war in afghanistan, u.s. president donald trump chastised pakistan over its alleged support for afghan militants   an approach analysts say will probably not change pakistan s strategic calculations and might push it in directions washington does not want it to go. trump s call for india to play a greater role in afghanistan, in particular, will ring alarm bells for pakistan s generals, analysts said.  trump s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,  said zahid hussain, a pakistani security analyst. trump criticised pakistan for providing  safe havens to terrorist organisations  and warned islamabad it had much to lose by supporting insurgents battling the u.s. backed kabul government.  it is kind of putting pakistan on notice,  said rustam shah mohman, pakistan s former ambassador to kabul, predicting a bumpy road ahead for relations. trump did resist some advisers  calls to threaten to declare pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism unless islamabad pursued senior leaders of the afghan taliban and the allied haqqani network.  pakistan should not be reassured by this speech, but it could have gone a lot worse for them,  said joshua white, a national security council director under former president barack obama.   there were voices within the administration who wanted to move more quickly and aggressively to declare pakistan not just a problem, but effectively an enemy.  in washington, a senior administration official said on tuesday that significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. the official spoke on condition of anonymity. pakistan s powerful military has not commented on trump s speech, but the day before it denied any militants had havens in the country.     the pakistani government said foreign minister khawaja asif met with the u.s. ambassador on tuesday and would speak in coming days with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson  on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new u.s. policy on south asia .  successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan. washington fumes about inaction against the taliban, but pakistan has been helpful on other counterterrorism efforts, including against al qaeda and islamic state militants. the united states also has no choice but to use pakistani roads to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan. u.s. officials worry that if pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilise afghanistan and endanger u.s. soldiers. daniel feldman, a special representative for afghanistan and pakistan under obama, said the obama administration found it more effective to pressure islamabad over safe havens  in private than in public, and to keep the long standing indo pak rivalry from playing out in afghanistan . hussain, the security analyst, said trump on monday  crossed a red line  as far as pakistan was concerned when he implored india to deepen its involvement in afghanistan. relations between pakistan and the united states have endured strain during the 16 year war in afghanistan, especially after al qaeda chief osama bin laden was killed by u.s. special forces inside pakistan in 2011.   the obama administration had already begun trimming military aid to pakistan. last year, the pentagon decided not to pay $300 million in pledged military funding, and congress effectively blocked a subsidised sale of f 16 jets to pakistan. analysts say trump is likely to further curtail military aid  to pressure pakistan. but any effort to isolate pakistan would face problems from china, which has deepened political and military ties to islamabad as it invested nearly $60 billion in infrastructure in pakistan. china on tuesday defended pakistan after trump s remarks, saying its neighbour was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made  great sacrifices  and  important contributions  in the fight. mohman, the former ambassador, said if the united states kept putting pressure on pakistan, then islamabad would drift farther from the american sphere of influence.  we have options,  he said.  we can go to china and russia, and i think the u.s. can t afford that.

driven more than 600,000 people from myanmar to neighbouring bangladesh. human rights monitors have accused myanmar s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless rohingya during so called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. myanmar s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops.  we are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,  suu kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the asia europe meeting, or asem, in myanmar s capital naypyitaw.  we can t say whether it has happened or not. as a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won t happen.  nobel laureate suu kyi said she hoped talks with bangladesh s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the  safe and voluntary return  of those who have fled. suu kyi s less than two year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under myanmar s transition to power after decades of military rule. while a top un official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing , u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on a visit to myanmar last week refused to label it as such. in early november, u.s. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials. democratic senator jeff merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the senate, led a congressional delegation that visited rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence hit north of the state and to rohingya camps. the group also traveled to cox s bazar district in bangladesh, where rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies.  many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. this has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,  merkley told reporters in myanmar on tuesday.  we are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the rohingya by the military and local groups,  he said. the delegation called for myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community.  we want to emphasize that the world is watching,  merkley said, adding that it was important myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. merkley said the delegation was  not here today to recommend what the u.s. government would do or should do,  when asked about the legislation introduced in the congress. myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the united nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps.  individuals cannot be coming back simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,  said merkley. he warned that isolating people in camps creates a  two tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.  speaking earlier on tuesday, suu kyi said discussions would be held with the bangladesh foreign minister on wednesday and thursday about repatriation. officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the rohingya wanting to return.  we hope that this would result in an mou signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,  suu kyi said. the rohingya are largely stateless and many people in myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh. suu kyi said myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of rohingya, who had fled to bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. that agreement did not address the citizenship status of rohingya, and bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided rohingya with more safeguards this time.  it s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,  suu kyi said. earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal, but a senior myanmar official later accused bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees.

" mexicans favor u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton over republican donald trump by a 10 1 ratio, according to a poll. the poll, conducted by consulta mitofsky and released last week, showed that 2.9 percent of mexicans have a favorable opinion of trump, compared to 30.4 percent for clinton.  the poll comes almost a month after a meeting between trump and mexican president enrique pena nieto in mexico city sparked outrage across the country and led to the resignation of luis videgaray as finance minister. roy campos, director of the mitofsky polling firm, said mexican interest in the u.s. presidential election signified a change from years past.  “while in the election of 2008 the interest awakened by [democratic president barack] obama was based on approval ... now the interest is because of fear,” campos said, adding that trump is the least popular u.s. presidential candidate among mexicans in history. when he announced his candidacy last year, trump said mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states and that he would build a wall on the southern u.s. border and make mexico pay for it. he also has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on mexico, deport millions of migrants and ditch the north american free trade agreement. the poll, which was conducted between sept. 2 and 5, surveyed 1,000 mexicans and had a margin of error of 3.1 percent.

" former president george w. bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on thursday in a new york speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of president donald trump.  bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow republican’s nine month white house tenure. he did not mention trump by name. “bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. the only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” bush said at the bush institute’s national forum on freedom, free markets and security. trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “crooked hillary” for democrat hillary clinton and, more recently, “liddle” bob corker for a republican senator who dared to challenge him. bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that trump has cracked down on while in office. “we’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to america,” bush said.  “we see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.” asked whether the speech was aimed at trump, a spokesman for bush said the long planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years. “the themes president bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said bush spokesman freddy ford. bush touted u.s. alliances abroad, something trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year. in the speech, bush described a decline in public confidence in u.s. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs. “discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. bigotry seems emboldened. our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” bush said. “we have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”  trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that democratic former president barack obama was not born in the united states. obama, trump’s predecessor, was born in the u.s. state of hawaii. bush said americans were the heirs of thomas jefferson, the third u.s. president, as well as civil rights leader martin luther king, jr. “this means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally american,” he said. “it means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the american creed.” trump has had a rocky relationship with the bush family. he belittled former florida governor jeb bush, who was an early  opponent of trump for the republican presidential nomination, and has criticized george w. bush for the war in iraq and for presiding over the sept. 11, 2001 attacks. bush said globalization could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.” he also had harsh words for russia and seemed to take aim at trump for playing down moscow’s intervention in the u.s. election. “according to our intelligence services, the russian government has made a project of turning americans against each other. this effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.  “foreign aggressions, including cyber attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. this is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”     ",0
" president elect donald trump’s drive to rebuild u.s. roads, bridges, ports and other public works projects with a $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan would come as the country faces a shortage of skilled laborers.   before any dirt can be moved, trump would have to get approval from congress. but with democratic support and a push from business groups, there is some optimism that trump could win over skeptical republicans who control congress, if the plan does not add significantly to federal debt.   more than two thirds of u.s. roads are in less than good condition and nearly 143,000 bridges need repair or improvement, the transportation department estimates.     at the same time, construction contractors have reported tight labor conditions in the south, midwest and southwest, causing project delays, the federal reserve noted last month. earlier this year, the national association of home builders estimated there were around 200,000 unfilled construction jobs in the united states, an 81 percent increase in the last two years.  infrastructure projects need highly trained workers, such as heavy equipment operators and iron specialists. but as a result of the 2007 2008 recession, which caused an estimated 25 percent of construction jobs to vanish, their ranks have thinned. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2h9pajx) many of these workers went back to school, joined the military or got lower paying jobs in retail, services and other sectors. some just got too old for the rigors of construction. “they wandered off into other careers,” said leonard toenjes, president of associated general contractors of missouri, which represents contractors in the state. undocumented immigrants, who otherwise might help replenish those ranks, are unlikely candidates however, since companies do not want to invest in training people with an uncertain status, especially given trump’s anti immigrant bent. the labor shortage is driving up construction costs, according to government and industry experts, which could cut into the scope of any new washington investment scheme. in response to the construction “skills gap,” the u.s. department of labor and federal highway administration are aiming to expand help to localities training workers for road and bridge building, according to a fhwa spokesman. even if the scope of work is not as grandiose as trump originally envisioned, it would benefit a range of businesses, from steel maker nucor corp and concrete firm us concrete inc to construction machinery companies such as caterpillar inc. more infrastructure spending would boost trade unions, too, which appeals to democrats.      “we will build new roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads, airports, schools and hospitals,” trump boasted in a dec. 1 speech in cincinnati. a trump transition representative, who asked not to be named because the topic was still under discussion, said that enactment of “infrastructure funding legislation” is one of the top priorities for the first 100 days of the new administration. a trump website refers to taking steps that would fill a $1 trillion gap in infrastructure investments over 10 years. like many trump campaign proposals, his infrastructure plan is thin on details. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters earlier this month: “what i hope we will clearly avoid, and i’m confident we will, is a trillion dollar stimulus.” in a departure from past fiscal policies, trump has proposed slashing taxes and expanding infrastructure investment at a time of economic stability. historically, such steps have been used by the government to provide economic stimulus in recessions. trump has discussed investor tax credits for infrastructure projects. democrats have attacked this as a boon to wall street that would spark too few projects and create too few jobs. house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters last week infrastructure is something her party could collaborate on with republicans. but she said democrats would reject anything “disguised as infrastructure. it has to be a real infrastructure bill that grows the paychecks of american workers.”     if congress balks at writing a big check, there is talk of a mix of alternatives. one could involve new corporate income tax revenue from bringing foreign profits into the country. others could be an infrastructure revolving fund, raising the gasoline tax or a new surface freight fee, experts said. these could help marquee projects move forward: a hudson river rail tunnel between new york and new jersey; a deeper port in charleston, south carolina; expanded rail service in southern california; fixing the crumbling i 70 freeway in missouri; replacing a key bridge linking ohio and kentucky. harry holzer, professor of public policy at georgetown university, said fixing roads and bridges would boost u.s. productivity and, depending on how it is structured, generate good paying jobs for those without college educations. given shortages of high skilled construction labor, he said government ought to ramp up the projects carefully to allow time to train a new generation of skilled workers. “i’m not sure anyone has thought that through,” he said.

" bangladesh approved a $280 million project on tuesday to develop an isolated and flood prone island in the bay of bengal to temporarily house 100,000 rohingya muslims fleeing violence in neighbouring myanmar.     the decision came just days after bangladesh sealed a deal aiming to start returning rohingya to myanmar within two months to reduce pressure in refugee camps.     a bangladeshi government committee headed by prime minister sheikh hasina approved the plan to develop bhashan char island, also known as thenger char, despite criticism from humanitarian workers who have said the island is all but uninhabitable. planning minister mustafa kamal said it would take time to repatriate the refugees, and in the meantime bangladesh needed a place to house them. the project to house 100,000 refugees on the island would be complete by 2019, he said.      many rohingya people are living in dire conditions,  he said, describing the influx of refugees as  a threat to both security and the environment .  more than 620,000 rohingya muslims have sought sanctuary in bangladesh after the military in mostly buddhist myanmar launched a harsh counter insurgency operation in their villages across the northern parts of rakhine state, following attacks by rohingya militants on an army base and police posts on aug. 25. bangladesh foreign minister abul hassan mahmood ali appealed in september for international support to transport rohingya to the island. there were already about 300,000 rohingya refugees in bangladesh before the most recent exodus. bangladesh, one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations, plans to develop the island, which emerged from the silt off bangladesh s delta coast only 11 years ago and is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement.     it regularly floods during the june september monsoons. when seas are calm, pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom.    a plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was first proposed in 2015 and revived last year. despite criticism of the conditions on the island, bangladesh says it has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees.

" libya s eastern based parliament voted on tuesday to approve some u.n. proposals aimed at unifying the divided north african nation, although major obstacles remain for a deal to stabilize the oil producer. the u.n. launched a new round of talks in september to end years of turmoil in libya following a 2011 nato backed uprising and unite the rival governments and parliaments in tripoli and the east. choosing the members of the presidency and the government, and settling the question of military leadership are seen as the biggest hurdles to any deal. only a minority of members of the house of representatives in benghazi took part in tuesday s vote, so it is unclear to what extent it will advance the latest push for a political deal. opposition in the house had been a key obstacle to previous u.n. peace efforts. a rival assembly in tripoli is also meant to approve the proposals. the u.n. talks were suspended in october, but the organization has been working behind the scenes. its envoy ghassan salame said last week that delegations from rival assemblies were  close to a consensus . on tuesday, a majority of about 75 members of the house present approved u.n. proposals regarding the broader structure of a future government, said fathi al marimi, an adviser to house speaker agila saleh. an unspecified number were flown in by saleh on a private plane, he said. the house session had originally been planned for monday but was postponed when a u.n. flight carrying some deputies based in western libya was prevented from landing. the u.n. proposals are aimed at relaunching a deal signed in december 2015, which produced a u.n. backed government in tripoli that has struggled to assert its authority and never been accepted by factions that control the east of the country. salame said last week that he was planning to hold a national conference in february to agree how to finalize a transition, and that the u.n. was working to establish the right conditions for holding new elections.

" a yemeni government official expressed disappointment over a decision by the u.s. supreme court on monday to allow much of president donald trump’s ban on travelers from six muslim majority countries and all refugees to go back into effect. “we’re disappointed with this decision. we believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism, but rather will increase feelings among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted,” said ahmed al nasi, an official in yemen’s ministry of expatriate affairs. this was especially the case, he added, “given that yemen is an active partner of the united states in the war on terrorism,” conducting joint operations against militants inside yemen.

" the chances that the republican party will decide its nominee for the november presidential election through a brokered convention have increased since super tuesday even as front runner donald trump has racked up primary wins, according to two online betting sites.  according to predictit, the probability of a brokered convention stood at 43 percent as of midday on wednesday, following primaries in five states, including florida and illinois, the previous night. that was up from 35 percent on march 2, the day after trump won contests in seven out of 11 states, according to the website, which is run by victoria university in wellington, new zealand. according to ladbrokes plc, another online betting site, the chances of a brokered convention were 4 5 on wednesday, down from evens on march 2. that means there is a 56 percent probability of a brokered convention, up from 50 percent. trump’s chances of winning the general election dropped to 5/2 from 2/1 despite his victories on tuesday night, but ladbrokes attributed the result partly to a large single bet of nearly $20,000 that skewed the results. that gives him a 29 percent probability of winning, down from 33 percent.  the billionaire new york businessman has emerged as the clear leader in the republican race. on tuesday, he scored big wins in primaries in florida, illinois and north carolina, knocking out rival marco rubio and bringing him closer to the 1,237 convention delegates he needs to win the nomination. but he lost the crucial state of ohio and left the door open for those in the party trying to stop him from becoming the republican nominee for the nov. 8 election. that means that trump might fall short of the majority required, enabling the party’s establishment to put forward another name at the july convention in cleveland to formally pick its candidate. meanwhile, democratic front runner hillary clinton’s chances of winning the presidency fell to 4/9 from 8/15. that increases her probability of winning to 69 percent from 65 percent following tuesday’s primary victories in florida, illinois, ohio and north carolina. those wins cast doubt on u.s. senator bernie sanders’ ability to overtake her for the democratic party’s nomination.

" u.s. senators pushed for a compromise gun control bill on tuesday, a day after the senate failed to advance four gun measures following last week’s mass shooting in orlando, the deadliest in modern u.s. history.   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would schedule a vote on a bill by fellow republican senator susan collins that would prevent about 109,000 people on “no fly” and other surveillance lists from purchasing guns. collins said she expected a vote on the bill this week or next. on monday, the senate defeated a democratic prohibition on gun sales to people on a broader range of government watch lists, while also blocking a narrower republican measure.  some senior republicans would not commit to supporting the collins bill, citing worries about people being denied the ability to buy weapons without adequate safeguards. but the no. 3 senate democrat, chuck schumer, told reporters: “there may be a glimmer of hope now,” adding that collins’ proposal seemed to be “a step in the right direction.” the measure is being debated in the senate before the nov. 8 election when democrats hope to win control of the senate and gain seats in the house of representatives. democrats believe republican congressional opposition to wider control bills gives them a powerful campaign issue. it was too soon to tell if president barack obama would support the collins bill. spokesman josh earnest said senior officials including lawyers at the department of justice were taking a look at it. “if the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun, then that’s likely something that we’ll be able to support,” earnest told reporters in a daily briefing.   in the senate on monday, four measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists   two put forth by democrats and two by republicans   fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100 member chamber. the votes were a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through congress despite repeated mass shootings. the bills lost in largely party line votes that showed the political power in congress of gun rights defenders and the national rifle association. the white house accused u.s. senators of a “shameful display of cowardice” and said they failed the american people by not advancing any gun control measures after the florida shooting. the gunman, omar mateen, pledged allegiance to islamic state during the june 12 rampage in which he killed 49 people and wounded 53 at an orlando gay nightclub before being fatally shot by police. senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, said he had concerns about the collins measure. “it’s a slippery slope when an american citizen is denied a constitutional right, without forcing the government to come forward with some evidence on the front end” that a person should be prohibited from buying guns, he said.   after monday’s votes, the senate also debated a different tactic for battling domestic attacks that could be inspired by islamic state and other foreign militant groups. senators were aiming to vote by wednesday on legislation by republican john mccain of arizona expanding the federal bureau of investigation’s ability to conduct secret surveillance in counter terrorism investigations. “this week we’ll have the opportunity to strengthen our ability to combat lone wolf terrorists and connect the dots so we are better able to prevent terrorist attacks in the united states” such as the orlando massacre, mcconnell said. collins, who held a news conference with eight other senators including democrat bill nelson of florida, said her bill would stop about 2,700 americans and 106,300 foreign national on surveillance lists from buying guns. “we believe that if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane you are too dangerous to buy a gun,” the maine lawmaker said. she said americans and immigrants with work permits could appeal a denial and recover lawyers’ fees if they prevailed.  nelson said he owed it to the families of the victims in the orlando shooting as well as police and other first responders to the carnage.  it was not clear whether collins’ plan would draw significant bipartisan support. the nra said her proposal was “unconstitutional” and would not have prevented the orlando attack.  gun control groups promised to intensify their push for legislative action, and not just in washington. shannon watts, founder of moms demand action for gun sense in america, said her group, besides supporting pro gun control candidates for congress, would work to strengthen gun sale background check laws “state by state until congress acts.” “if the nra and their lapdogs in the senate thought moms would feel dispirited and back down, they are sorely mistaken,” watts told reporters in a teleconference.

" senator mark kirk of illinois on tuesday accused many of his fellow senate republicans of being “closed minded” by refusing to consider president barack obama’s nomination of merrick garland to serve on the u.s. supreme court. kirk, facing a tough re election battle in his democratic leaning state, became the first republican senator to meet with garland since obama nominated the centrist appellate judge and former prosecutor on march 16 to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. there is a need for “open minded, rational, responsible people” to ensure the confirmation process works, kirk told reporters before his private meeting with garland, who already has met with some senate democrats. most of the 100 member senate’s 54 republicans have backed senate majority leader mitch mcconnell’s hard line stance against confirming any obama nominee or even meeting with garland. “i think when you just say, ‘i’m not going to meet with him at all’   that’s too closed minded,” added kirk, a first term senator who may be one of the most endangered senate republicans in the nov. 8 elections. maine’s susan collins also took her fellow senate republicans to task for blocking garland’s confirmation process.  collins told wgan radio, “whether republicans like him (obama) or not, he is our president until inauguration day next january.” collins said there seemed to be “no basis” for senators to refuse even to consider garland. mcconnell has said the senate should leave it to obama’s successor, who will take office next january after november’s elections, to fill the vacancy. more than a dozen senate republicans have indicated a willingness to at least meet with garland. last week, kansas republican senator jerry moran, also running for re election, was assailed by conservative groups after urging that the confirmation process proceed, even though he made clear he would not vote for garland. meetings with senators are a standard part of the confirmation process, allowing lawmakers to get acquainted with nominees for a lifetime position on the supreme court. republicans fear garland could move the court to the left for the first time in decades. the white house said the court’s split 4 4 ruling in an important labor case on tuesday underscored the need to confirm scalia’s replacement. “with a supreme court that is not fully staffed, it makes it more likely that situations can arise across the country where there are different rulings in different circuit courts that are not resolved by the supreme court,” spokesman josh earnest told reporters aboard air force one as obama flew to atlanta.

" british prime minister theresa may s offer of  settled status  for eu residents is flawed and will leave them with fewer rights after brexit, the european parliament s brexit coordinator said on tuesday. a family of five could face a bill of 360 pounds to acquire the new status, guy verhofstadt told may s brexit secretary david davis in a letter seen by reuters    a very significant amount for a family on low income . listing three other concerns for the eu legislature, which must approve any treaty on the march 2019 exit, verhofstadt told davis:  under your proposals, eu citizens will definitely notice a deterioration of their status as a result of brexit. and the parliament s aim all along has been that eu citizens, and uk citizens in the eu 27, should notice no difference.  verhofstadt, a former belgian prime minister, wrote in response to davis, who had written to him after parliament complained last week that there remained  major issues  to be settled on the rights of the 3 million eu citizens in britain. on tuesday, he told reporters that parliament was determined that expatriates should not become  victims of brexit . may had unveiled more details last week of a system aimed at giving people already in britain a quick and cheap way of asserting their rights to stay there indefinitely. the issue, along with how much britain owes and the new eu uk border across ireland, is one on which the eu wants an outline agreement before opening talks on the future of trade. verhofstadt said lawmakers were not dismissing british efforts to streamline applications but saw flaws in the nature of  settled status  itself. as well as the cost, which is similar to that of acquiring a british passport, he cited three others:   europeans should simply  declare  a whole household resident, without needing an  application  process; the burden of proof should be on the british authorities to deny them rights.   more stringent conditions on criminal records could mean some eu residents, including some now with permanent resident status, being deported for failing to gain  settled status .   eu residents would lose some rights to bring relatives to britain as the new status would give them the same rights as british people, who now have fewer rights than eu citizens.

" u.s. president donald trump’s state visit to the united kingdom could happen around june, the outgoing chief of london’s metropolitan police said on thursday. speaking on an lbc radio show, police chief bernard hogan howe said: “i think president trump is coming around june.” the police chief added that there was concern about protests during the visit. prime minister theresa may, seeking closer ties to washington as britain withdraws from the european union, invited trump to make a state visit to britain. a state visit involves lavish displays of royal pageantry and a banquet hosted by queen elizabeth.  may’s invitation prompted criticism in britain with over 1.8 million people signing a petition calling for the visit to be scrapped. the speaker of the lower house of britain’s parliament said he did not support the idea of trump addressing parliament during the visit. “the invitation has only relatively recently been extended and accepted,” may’s spokesman told reporters. “the details surrounding that trip are yet to be firmed up.”  ",0
" anyone seeking a table at carmine’s italian restaurant near capitol hill on a tuesday or wednesday needs to battle a mid week crush of congress members and their staff. but mondays are far quieter — just like the floor of congress. there are usually around nine events on a monday, compared to as many as 30 on a midweek day, says kelly fitzgerald, carmine’s director of special events and catering.  the mid week crunch at carmine’s underscores a trend: members of the u.s. congress have been spending fewer days working in washington since the late 2000s, according to a reuters review of congressional records going back 18 years. lawmakers increasingly try to cram their legislative work into the middle of the week in washington and then rush back home. their absence from the capital reinforces the effects of a deepening partisan divide in recent years that has led to high profile deadlocks over legislation previously seen as routine, according to some former lawmakers and political analysts. under pressure to spend more time in their home constituencies, often fund raising for campaigns, members have less time to attend debates and mingle with other lawmakers.  “in any work setting, if you don’t know your colleagues, it makes it much more difficult to get things done,” said dan glickman, who was a democratic house member from kansas for 18 years until the mid 1990s and recalls more working days and fuller debates than the current congress. “...it makes it more difficult to build relationships,” said glickman, who was u.s. secretary of agriculture after congress.  he was a member of the bipartisan policy center’s commission on political reform, which recommended in 2014 that congress be in session conducting legislative business for 180 to 200 days a year. (graphic on congressional working days: tmsnrt.rs/1vsssoz) in 2015, the first year of a two year congress, the house of representatives put in 130 working days, the reuters review found. compared with the first years of recent congresses, that number has declined steadily since 2007, when the house worked 153 days — the high since 1998. house members typically meet more often in the first year of a congress because in the second year they have to run for reelection. this year, an election year, the house calendar foresees 111 working days in washington, in line with the total in recent election years.   the house cancelled its entire schedule last week after a snowstorm hit the east coast. the senate’s annual working days have not risen above 156 since reaching a peak of 188 in 2009. the decline in working days in recent years has coincided with a slide in americans’ approval rating for the legislature as the reputation of a “do nothing” congress has taken hold. since fiscal 1997, congress has failed every year to enact on time all of the government appropriations bills needed for a full federal budget, the congressional research service said. more recently, polarized lawmakers often have been unable to find middle ground on pressing issues such as immigration, tax reform and gun safety. as of the end of 2014, about 75 percent of major issues were in deadlock, according to a calculation by sarah binder of the brookings institution think tank. mid week squeeze to be sure, members of the house and the senate, who are paid $174,000 a year, do important work outside of washington. they meet with constituents in their home districts and raise campaign money by appearing and speaking at events. representative ryan zinke, a freshman republican and former u.s. navy seal, said congress could use more “team building” activities, but he has not felt the need for more days in legislative session. zinke is the only house member representing the large, sparsely populated state of montana, and says he needs lots of travel time just to see his constituents. “last week i think i put on about 2,500 miles (4,000 km) traveling around montana, and i saw about a third of the state,” he said. staying in legislative session more does not necessarily equate to getting more work done, said don stewart, spokesman for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a republican.  “it’s a matter of what you do with the time you are here, not just the total time you are here,” he said. the republican led congress had a relatively productive year in 2015, fixing a funding formula for medicare doctors, passing a highway bill and approving fast track authority for trade deals. in 2011 and 2013, the total number of bills passed by congress dipped below triple figures to 90 and 72 respectively. last year’s congress managed to enact 113. many bills are minor, however, so the total number does not necessarily correspond to productivity. “pro forma” sessions the recent decline in overall working days does not tell the whole story. there has also been a rise in so called “pro forma” days when lawmakers go into session sometimes for just a few minutes or even seconds, for procedural reasons. they are formally counted as sessions of the house and senate, but reuters did not include them in its tally.  last year the house had 27 pro forma days, none of which lasted more than seven minutes, the reuters review found. in each of the last five years the house had more pro forma days than in previous congresses going back to 2002. those days are usually scheduled for monday or friday, enabling lawmakers to fly in and out of washington without missing mid week votes.  the typical house member returns to their district 40 or more times a year, said brad fitch of congressional management foundation, a nonprofit that advises lawmakers on managing their offices. it did a study showing that in 2013, the average house freshman spent $53,170 of taxpayer money on travel. these days, fewer lawmakers move their families to the capital to live, said john fortier, director of the democracy project at the bipartisan policy center, a washington think tank. paul ryan, the wisconsin republican who has been speaker of the house since october, sleeps on a cot in his washington office during the congressional work week and flies home to his family in wisconsin on the weekend. vin weber, who was a republican congressman from minnesota in the 1980s and 1990s, said that in the attempt to juggle all the demands they face at home and in washington, today’s lawmakers have set themselves an impossible schedule. “they are on planes constantly, back and forth, all the time,” he said. “there’s no rationality to it at all.” the rising cost of election campaigns mean lawmakers have to devote more time to fund raising outside washington, said glickman, now a senior fellow at the bipartisan policy center. as a congressman, glickman said, he often went to the house floor just to listen to the debate.  “if i did that now, i would be guilty of malpractice,” he said. “you need to be either in committee doing your work or raising money.”

" an activist investor in chevron corp said on monday it filed a shareholder resolution that would require the oil producer to report on the feasibility of ending operations in myanmar, where a crackdown on minority rohingya muslims has been decried by the united states as  ethnic cleansing.  the resolution, filed last week by islamic finance firm azzad asset management, pushes chevron s board of directors to consider how it could avoid risks  posed by doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity.  azzad filed a similar resolution at the last chevron shareholder meeting, garnering support from 6 percent of votes cast. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled to southern bangladesh since the end of august following a campaign by myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants in rakhine state. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and united nations officials have decried the crackdown as a form of genocide.    myanmar denies committing atrocities against the rohingya.  chevron, the second largest u.s. based oil producer, does business in myanmar through a subsidiary, unocal myanmar offshore co ltd. it has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company s website. in a statement to reuters on monday, chevron spokeswoman melissa ritchie said the company  values the ongoing dialogue with the stockholders on this critical issue of violence in rakhine state, myanmar.  we will continue to work with other u.s. companies and the government to promote the value of u.s. investment in myanmar and the need to foster a business environment that respects human rights.  chevron has the option of accepting the proposal or asking the u.s. securities and exchange commission to allow it to block it. if chevron moves to block, azzad would have the chance to appeal to the sec. chevron s annual meeting is slated for next spring.    the filing comes as two reuters journalists were arrested by myanmar officials last week. government officials accuse the pair of violating the country s colonial era officials secrets act. the arrests have been criticized by several governments as well as journalists  and human rights groups. chevron declined to directly comment on the arrests.

" u.s. president donald trump on monday issued an executive order revoking limits imposed by predecessor barack obama on the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, the white house said. obama had curtailed the equipment transfer program after law enforcement officers using military style armored vehicles and guns confronted protesters in ferguson, missouri, in 2014 following the fatal police shooting of a black teenager. trump’s executive order said, “all executive departments and agencies are directed, as of the date of this order and consistent with federal law, to cease implementing those recommendations and, if necessary, to take prompt action to rescind any rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing them.” the republican president has reversed or cut back many of his democratic predecessor’s policies since taking office in january. the use of military equipment in ferguson prompted a wider outcry over the use of war fighting equipment by local law enforcement agencies in the united states. after a review, obama barred the military from transferring certain types of equipment to police or sheriff’s departments, including tracked armored vehicles, armed aircraft or vehicles of any kind, .50 caliber firearms and ammunition, grenade launchers, bayonets and camouflage uniforms. obama also required law enforcement agencies to justify the need for items like helicopters and other aircraft, wheeled armored vehicles, unmanned drones, riot helmets and “flash bang” grenades. “these restrictions that had been imposed went too far,” u.s. attorney general jeff sessions told a meeting of the fraternal order of police union in nashville, tennessee, earlier on monday. “we will not put superficial concerns above public safety. we will do our best to get you what you need.” sessions did not specify what those superficial concerns were. sessions said helmets and body armor available through the defense department program were the types of equipment that saved the life of a police officer during the 2016 orlando, florida, nightclub shooting. and helicopters and armored vehicles are vital to emergency and disaster response, he said. monday’s order drew criticism from some of trump’s fellow republicans in congress. “it is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime, but it is another for them to subsidize militarization,” senator rand paul said in a statement. paul promised to introduce legislation that would ban transfers of certain military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, improve transparency surrounding such transfers, and require the agencies to return equipment prohibited under the proposed law. u.s. representative mark sanford also condemned the executive order, criticizing the transfer program as a potential waste of taxpayers’ dollars. he said in a statement that he had introduced a bill in 2016 to auction off military equipment instead of give it to local agencies. the defense department’s law enforcement support program has transferred more than $6 billion worth of equipment to police agencies since its inception 25 years ago, pentagon figures show.

"president obama, accompanied by first lady michelle along with his two daughters, just landed in cuba and he is looking to thaw political differences between the two countries that has spanned decades. obama, who has made reaching out to cuba one of the main objectives of his presidency, earned the ire of the republican party which has preferred divisive politics rather than open dialogue and understanding between the two countries. florida senator and former presidential candidate marco rubio was upset after obama had announced the visit. he said: rather than achieving several long-standing u.s. goals and national security interests, you have methodically squandered this opportunity, legitimizing the castro regime and enriching it in the process. a presidential visit to cuba absent of any concessions from its government is a dangerous idea, and i urge you to reconsider. with that lack of innovative thinking, one can see why rubio was trounced in his home state of florida by donald trump. then there s ted cruz, whose father is a cuban american. the creepy cruz also disagreed to the visit. he said: he has alienated and abandoned our friends and allies. you know, one of the first things he did when he became president was send the bust of winston churchill back to the united kingdom. that was shameful. despite republican resistance, the president and dozens of u.s. lawmakers and business leaders joined him in cuba for the visit. air force one touched down at havana s airport on sunday after a three-hour flight from washington. while deep differences persist, obama s approach in thinking outside of the box on cuba will bring fruitful economic and political ties for both countries in the future.instead of embracing the president s ingenuity, the republicans will always be republicans.here s the video:",1

" u.s. presidential candidate donald trump played down market turmoil in the wake of britain’s decision to leave the european union on a visit to his trump international golf course in aberdeen on saturday. wearing an open necked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan “make america great again”, trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following britain’s vote to leave the eu on thursday.  “there’s always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do,” he said. global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31 year low. trump, whose mother was scottish, was greeted by around a dozen protesters at the course waving mexican flags, rainbow flags for gay pride day and signs that read “donald stop the hating” and “shame on you for ruining a beautiful landscape.” trump last year proposed a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states as a response to islamist attacks in paris and california, causing a furor in europe. in an article in a scottish newspaper earlier this year, trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that americans would get if he were to become president. he also met with news corporation media mogul rupert murdoch and his wife jerry hall, giving them a tour of the course in a golf cart.

" the european union on monday reaffirmed its support for a 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers despite sharp criticism of the accord by president donald trump, and it urged u.s. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on tehran. trump defied both u.s. allies and adversaries on friday by refusing to formally certify that tehran is complying with the accord, even though international inspectors say it is, and said he might ultimately terminate the agreement. eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg said a failure to uphold an international agreement backed by the u.n. security council could have serious consequences for regional peace, and also undermine efforts to check north korea s nuclear ambitions.  as europeans together, we are very worried that the decision of the u.s. president could lead us back into military confrontation with iran,  german foreign minister sigmar gabriel told reporters. after a closed door meeting chaired by eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini on iran, the ministers issued a joint statement saying the 2015 deal was key to preventing the global spread of nuclear weapons.  the eu is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the jcpoa,  it said, referring to the joint comprehensive plan of action, the formal name of the accord with iran agreed in july 2015 in vienna.  trump meanwhile renewed his criticism of the accord, and raised the possibility he might try to end it completely.   we ll see what phase two is. phase two might be positive, and it might be very negative. it might be a total termination. that s a very real possibility. some would say that s a great possibility,  the u.s. president said in washington. he repeated his contention that the jcpoa was  a horrible deal for the united states.  eu foreign ministers said the accord was crucial to opening up iran s $400 billion economy and finding a new market for european investors. unlike the united states, the eu saw relations with iran flourish in the late 1990s until revelations about tehran s nuclear plans in 2002.   non proliferation is a major element of world security and rupturing that would be extremely damaging,  french foreign minister jean yves le drian told reporters.  we hope that congress does not put this accord in jeopardy.   mogherini said she would travel to washington early next month to try to muster support for the accord.  the international atomic energy agency (iaea) says iran is complying with its commitments under the accord, which trump has branded  the worst deal ever negotiated . the eu still has sanctions in place against members of iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps, a major target of trump s criticism. the eu ministers also discussed on monday iran s ballistic missile program, which they want to see dismantled. tehran says that program is purely defensive. negotiated after 12 years of talks, the accord with iran is the most significant diplomatic success for the bloc in several decades.  many worry that the eu s reputation as an honest broker in a host of future conflicts may not recover if the u.s. congress reimposes sanctions on iran and causes the deal   which had the  strong backing of trump s predecessor barack obama   to unravel. most u.n. and western sanctions were lifted more than 18 months ago under the deal, though tehran is still subject to a u.n. arms embargo, which is not part of the deal. eu foreign ministers also approved a new batch of economic sanctions on north korea after its atomic test last month that included an oil embargo and investment ban. but some still hold out hope of repeating the iran nuclear deal with pyongyang at some future date. sweden is one of only seven eu countries with an embassy in pyongyang and its foreign minister, margot wallstrom, reiterated that stockholm could be counted on to help negotiate if asked. but germany s gabriel warned that trump s decision not to certify the iran accord could scupper such hopes, a position echoed by mogherini, although she stressed that no such eu mediation was underway.  my concern is that, if we want to talk to north korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,  gabriel said.

" the kansas secretary of state and the american civil liberties union (aclu) have reached a temporary agreement over the state’s voter registration laws, keeping kansas’ chief elections officer from a contempt of court hearing, according to court documents filed on thursday. the deal between secretary of state kris kobach and the aclu comes six weeks before the u.s. presidential election. the two sides have been at odds over a kansas law requiring people to prove american citizenship if they want to register to vote while applying for a driver’s license. critics say this requirement disenfranchises voters, especially minorities. the deal will allow people who registered at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without providing citizenship documents to vote in the nov. 8 election with a standard ballot, rather than be forced to use a provisional one, the aclu and kobach said in a status report filed on thursday. kobach will also clarify his office’s website to help voters find information more easily, according to the report filed to u.s. district judge julie robinson.  robinson had ordered kobach, a republican, to explain by thursday why he should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a federal order issued in may.  that order required him to register people who applied to vote at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without proof of citizenship. robinson canceled the contempt hearing scheduled for friday, according to her own court filing, citing the aclu and kobach’s agreement.  “our case is ongoing, but this interim agreement is a critical victory for kansans who want to vote in the november election. it is a shame that voters had to fight so hard to get kris kobach to do his job,” aclu attorney orion danjuma said in a statement. kobach said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, but criticized the aclu.  “the aclu’s argument was weak at best. however, at this point the preparations for the november 8, 2016, general election must proceed with rules established to ensure the efficient administration of the election,” he said in a statement.  kansas’ law, among the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, is defended by republicans who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud.  on tuesday, a kansas state judge issued a separate ruling extending voting rights through the nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices.

" the united nations security council has issued a wide range of sanctions against north korea, including entities and individuals in the reclusive country, for pursuing nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of u.n. resolutions. the united states, japan and south korea have also issued sanctions on north korea, but they are not binding on other countries. the united nations has blacklisted 39 north korean individuals and 42 entities, which are subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. u.n. member states are obliged to enforce the sanctions, which are far reaching and comprehensive. however, many include gray areas and exceptions which are subject to interpretation. the following u.n. sanctions are currently in force: north korea is under a total u.n. arms embargo. the sale of all arms and related materiel is banned. any financial transactions related to the procurement of north korean arms are also included under the sanctions.  the embargo has been in place since 2006 and was expanded in 2009 to include small arms and light weapons. north korea is also prohibited from selling helicopters under u.n. sanctions. under u.n. sanctions, north korea is banned or partially banned from selling coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and rare earth minerals. coal exports are allowed up to a maximum of $400.87 million or 7,500,000 metric tonnes a year, whichever is lower, provided u.n. member states do not purchase the coal from a sanctioned entity, and can prove that the coal is for “livelihood purposes”. china, north korea’s biggest trade partner, said in february it would suspend all imports of coal from north korea for the rest of the year as part of its efforts to implement the sanctions.   externally sourced coal which transits through the north korean city of rason, where russia maintains a warm water port, is exempt from the ban. sales of north korean copper, nickel, silver and zinc are completely banned under u.n. sanctions. only sales of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to north korea are banned under u.n. sanctions. the ban does not apply to north korean civilian aircraft, including state airline air koryo. there are no restrictions on crude oil or other oil products. any financial services which contribute to north korea’s banned missile and nuclear programs, or help pyongyang evade sanctions, are banned by the united nations. member states are prohibited from opening branches, subsidiaries or offices of north korean banks. joint ventures, ownership, or correspondent banking relationships with north korean banks is banned.  member states are required to expel and repatriate any individuals working for a north korean bank or institution on their territory, and limit the number of bank accounts for north korean diplomatic missions. u.n. member states are required to de register any vessel which is owned, operated or crewed by north korea, meaning north korean owned ships cannot fly the flag of another country, which has been one way of evading detection. member states are also not allowed to provide insurance services to north korean ships. north korea is prohibited from selling its ships under u.n. sanctions. it also cannot provide north korean crews to ships from other countries. the u.n. has not sanctioned north korea’s state owned airline, air koryo. it has, however, banned the sale of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to north korea, but air koryo and any north korean civilian aircraft refueling overseas are exempt from this. u.n. member states are required to prohibit, inspect or deny landing of any north korean aircraft within their territory they suspect to be carrying banned items, or taking part in any prohibited activities.  separately, the united states has unilaterally sanctioned air koryo, banning its citizens from doing business with the airline. it is unclear, however, if the sanctions cover u.s. citizens using the airline to travel to north korea for tourism. u.n. member states are required to inspect any cargo destined for, coming from or brokered by north korea, whether by air, sea, road or rail. this includes the inspection of checked or carry on baggage of people traveling to or from north korea. it is illegal under u.n. sanctions to directly or indirectly supply luxury goods to north korea. in the case of north korea, the u.n. defines luxury goods as: jewellery and precious stones, yachts, luxury cars, racing cars, luxury watches, snowmobiles, jet skis, recreational sports equipment, tableware worth more than $100 and rugs or tapestries worth more than $500. the resolutions require member states to reduce the number of staff at north korean diplomatic missions. north korean diplomats or consular officials are only allowed one bank account each. the use of real estate for any non diplomatic or consular activities in member states’ territories is banned. the training of or by north koreans in military, police and paramilitary techniques is banned.  with the exception of medical exchanges, u.n. member states are not allowed to provide training or cooperation in the fields of nuclear science, aerospace, advanced manufacturing and advanced aeronautical, chemical, mechanical, electrical or industrial engineering. the sale of north korean statues is banned under u.n. sanctions.

" the u.s. department of homeland security on friday designated u.s. election infrastructure as critical, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. the decision, announced in a statement by dhs secretary jeh johnson, followed a 2016 presidential campaign marred by concerns that hackers could disrupt the election. also on friday, u.s. intelligence agencies released a report accusing russian president vladimir putin of directing a campaign to hack democratic party computers in an effort to help republican donald trump win the u.s. presidency. u.s. officials determined hackers targeted more than 20 states’ voter registration systems during the election but that there was no evidence tallies were altered when ballots were cast on nov. 8. elevating election systems to critical infrastructure puts it on par with other sectors eligible to receive prioritized cyber security assistance from dhs, including communication and transportation systems, the banking industry and the energy grid. election infrastructure includes polling places, centralized vote tabulations locations, storage facilities and voter registration databases and voting machines, johnson said. johnson said he and his staff had consulted with state and local election officials and that he was “aware that many of them are opposed to this designation.” some conservative states such as georgia objected when the idea was floated during the  presidential campaign, claiming elections have historically been overseen by local officials. the classification was not “a federal takeover, regulation, oversight or intrusion concerning elections in this country,” johnson said in a statement. “this designation does nothing to change the role state and local governments have in administering and running elections.” ",0
" indonesia s foreign minister is due to meet myanmar leader aung san suu kyi on monday to discuss delivering humanitarian aid to members of myanmar s rohingya minority, as indonesian protesters urged their government to take a tougher line.  dozens of indonesians protested outside the myanmar embassy in jakarta on monday, calling for a cut in diplomatic ties with myanmar over violence against its rohingya muslim minority. aid agencies estimate that about 90,000 rohingya have fled from myanmar into neighboring bangladesh since violence erupted in the north of rakhine state last week.    we will discuss in detail indonesia s proposal on how indonesia can give humanitarian aid to rakhine state,  indonesian foreign minister retno marsudi said in a video statement from the myanmar city of yangon. she is also scheduled to travel to bangladesh to urge authorities there to protect fleeing rohingya refugees. in a sign of mounting public anger in jakarta, a petrol bomb was thrown at the myanmar embassy on sunday, causing a small fire. the protests follow demonstrations in malaysia and condemnation from world leaders such as president tayyip erdogan of turkey, who on friday said the violence against muslims amounted to genocide. the rohingya are denied citizenship in myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor south asian country after fleeing myanmar since the early 1990s. indonesia is home to the world s largest population of muslims. its government has been actively involved in providing aid for myanmar to develop rakhine state and protect the rights of the rohingya, alongside the majority buddhist community.     ifah rohma, an activist from a jakarta based organization called muslim friends of rohingya, said many indonesians as fellow muslims were concerned about the fate of rohingya.  indonesia should not be engaging in soft diplomacy,  rohma said outside the myanmar embassy, which was surrounded by heavy security and barbed wire.  now is the time to cut ties, recall our ambassador and expel their ambassador,  she said. myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last october.

" britain will not offer a figure or a formula for how much it believes it owes the european union, brexit minister david davis said on sunday, after the eu demanded that london spell out its approach to the final bill to unblock talks. with no movement in the negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union, britain may miss a december deadline to move the talks to a discussion of future trade ties, which businesses say is vital for them to make investment decisions. both sides are frustrated by the lack of progress, and last week the eu negotiator, michel barnier, said britain had two weeks to spell out how far it would  honour its obligations  to break the deadlock. but davis told sky news the eu had agreed britain would not need to offer  a number or a formula  for the financial deal when london accepted the bloc s schedule for the talks   first a discussion about the divorce and second, about future ties.  in every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable. the real deadline on this is, of course, december,  davis said, referring to the next eu summit, taking place in brussels on dec. 14 15, when britain hopes the bloc will launch the next phase of the talks.  (british taxpayers) would not want me to just come along and just give away billions of pounds. so we ve been very, very careful, and it s taking time and we will take our time to get to the right answer.     prime minister theresa may says she cannot offer a figure for the financial settlement until her government knows what the future relationship will be. but she also does not want to inflame brexit campaigners who have suggested britain walk away. james dyson, the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner and a brexit supporter, said he did not blame the government for the lack of progress.  the problem is with the people we are negotiating with. i think that demanding billions and billions to leave is quite outrageous, and demanding it before we ve negotiated anything is outrageous,  dyson told the bbc.  so i would walk away.  the so called brexit bill is not the only difficult hurdle in the talks so far. the two sides must also reach agreement on the uk border with eu member ireland   something that irish officials say is still a long way off. irish prime minister leo varadkar said he would not threaten to use a veto on the brexit talks  at this stage , but dublin has called on london to go beyond its promise that a  hard  border between ireland and northern ireland will not return. both britain and the eu say they are ready for a  no deal    a message reiterated by the bloc s barnier in the french weekly journal du dimanche, where he also called on britain to detail which financial commitments it would honor.  theresa may has committed to paying the contributions of 2019 and 2020, as well as other commitments, without specifying which ones,  barnier told journal du dimanche.  the european taxpayer should not pay the price of a decision made ... by the united kingdom.

" iran s supreme court has upheld a death sentence against a sweden based iranian academic convicted of spying for israel, the tehran prosecutor was quoted as saying on monday, confirming reports by amnesty international and his family. ahmadreza djalali, a medical doctor and lecturer at the karolinska institute, a stockholm medical university, was accused of providing information to israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists. djalali was arrested in iran in april 2016 and later convicted of espionage. he has denied the charges, amnesty said.  at least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what tehran said were assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy. western powers and israel said iran aimed to build a nuclear bomb. tehran denied this. the islamic republic hanged a man in 2012 over the killings, saying he was an agent for israeli intelligence agency mossad. on monday, tehran prosecutor abbas jafari dolatabadi said the supreme court recently upheld the death sentence against djalali, the news site of iran s judiciary, mizan, reported. dolatabadi said djalali had confessed to meeting mossad agents repeatedly to deliver information on iran s nuclear and defense plans and personnel, and helping to infect defense ministry  computer systems with viruses, mizan reported. london based amnesty international and djalali s wife said earlier this month that his lawyers were told that the supreme court had considered his case and upheld his death sentence. iranian state television broadcast last week what it described as djalali s confessions. his wife said he had been forced by his interrogators to read the confession. djalali was on a business trip to iran when he was arrested and sent to evin prison. he was held in solitary confinement for three months of his detention and tortured, amnesty said.  it said djalali wrote a letter inside prison in august stating he was being held for refusing to spy for iran. sweden condemned the sentence in october and said it had raised the matter with iranian envoys. seventy five nobel prize laureates petitioned iranian authorities last month to release djalali so he could  continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind .

" president donald trump plans to sign a repeal of obama era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the white house said on wednesday. republicans in congress on tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. the fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former president barack obama in 2015. white house spokesman sean spicer said he did not know when trump would sign the bill. the privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in october by the federal communications commission under the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc. under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. the reversal is a win for at&t inc, comcast corp and verizon communications inc. websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the federal trade commission. republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a tweet the vote was “terrible for american ppl, great for big biz.” republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility.     fcc chairman ajit pai, a republican, in december said he believes that net neutrality’s days are numbered. the rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services. critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. pai told reuters in february be backs “a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that” but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans.  trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality.

" local officials in wisconsin will decide for themselves how to carry out a presidential election recount after a state judge on tuesday rejected a lawsuit by former green party candidate jill stein to have the ballots counted by hand.  a recount of wisconsin’s three million votes is set to begin on thursday after stein’s campaign requested the audit and paid the state’s $3.5 million filing fee, state election officials say.   dane county circuit judge valerie bailey rihn ruled that wisconsin’s 72 county clerks will not be required to count ballots by hand as stein requested in a lawsuit filed on monday, attorney general brad schimel said in a statement.   bailey rihn said stein’s lawsuit, backed by the campaign of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, fell short of  wisconsin’s legal standard to ban use of ballot machines in a recount and failed to show enough evidence of fraud or other issues, the milwaukee journal sentinel said.  “i follow the law. that’s who i am, despite my personal opinions,” said bailey rihn, the journal reported. “it’s (the counties’) decision. it’s their discretion. i may disagree with it … but i must follow the law.” the ruling will not deter stein’s efforts, a lawyer for her campaign recount effort said, referring to the hand counting of ballots as the “gold standard.” “we are calling on all counties to respect the will of americans across the country and across the political spectrum, and follow the recommendation of the judge, and conduct a hand recount to ensure the accuracy, security, and integrity of this election,” matthew brinckerhoff said in a statement.   stein has also sought a recount in pennsylvania on monday, just hours before the state’s deadline, and her campaign said she would file a similar request in michigan by its deadline on wednesday. “election integrity experts have independently identified michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin as states where ‘statistical anomalies’ raised concerns,” her campaign said on its website, seeking donations to pay for recount filing fees.  donald trump’s stunning victory in the presidential contest has unleashed talk of recounts, with the republican president elect contributing a surprise twist. on sunday, trump tweeted that “serious voter fraud” occurred in california, new hampshire, and virginia, states that clinton won. all three states rejected trump’s claim, and the white house on monday said there had been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest.

" the white house said on friday that more candidates could be added to its list of potential nominees to fill the supreme court vacancy caused by the death of justice antonin scalia. “we are still in a position where the list is not closed at this point,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters during a briefing. “there are still people being considered for inclusion on the list of people that the president may consider for filling a supreme court vacancy.” the white house has not officially revealed its list of potential picks to replace scalia. earnest said he did not expect a nominee would be named before president barack obama meets with congressional leaders at the white house on tuesday to discuss the matter. scalia’s death left the court with four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning that obama’s nominee could tip the balance of the court to the left for the first time in decades. republicans, who control the senate, have said the seat should remain vacant until obama’s successor takes office next january so voters could have a say in the selection when they choose a new president in the nov. 8 election. but obama has vowed to press ahead with nominating a justice. earnest said the white house would seek the help of former administration officials to coordinate outside activist groups in the fight over filling the vacancy. the new york times first reported on friday that the administration was recruiting former obama adviser stephanie cutter and former white house director of legislative affairs katie beirne fallon to help in its campaign. “we are going to draw on their contacts, and on the work they’re doing outside the administration to help us make the case, and organize the effort around the president’s constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the supreme court,” earnest said.",0

" the u.s. senate panel tasked with vetting labor secretary nominee and fast food executive andrew puzder will hold his confirmation hearing on feb.16, now that his ethics paperwork has been submitted to congress, a committee spokesman said wednesday. puzder’s certification from the office of government ethics arrived at the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions exactly two months after puzder was nominated to the job by president donald trump. a spokesman for puzder, george thompson, said he expects that puzder will turn in a separate questionnaire to the committee by thursday morning. puzder is the chief executive officer of cke restaurants inc, which owns primarily franchised restaurants including carl’s jr. and hardee’s. tentative plans for puzder’s hearing have been repeatedly postponed amid delays with a review by the office of government ethics. those stem from the complexities surrounding how puzder will divest himself from cke restaurants, which is owned by private equity firm roark capital group. other companies in roark capital’s portfolio include corner bakery, cinnabon, arby’s, carvel and auntie anne’s. senate democrats have been highly critical of puzder, a staunch critic of an overtime rule championed by the former obama administration. his nomination has sparked protests around the country by some cke fast food workers and the union backed “fight for $15” movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. workers from a number of cke’s franchised locations have also complained of wage and hour concerns and other labor conditions in recent weeks. in a letter to puzder sent on wednesday before the ethics paperwork was sent to the senate, the committee’s ranking democrat, patty murray, said she wanted to receive a “detailed account” of his plans for recusals, divestments and resignations in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest stemming from his business relationship with roark capital group. “the franchise model’s pervasive presence in the fast food industry, the frequency of serious labor violations connected with franchising and your past or present financial interest in roark raise questions regarding your ability to faithfully carry out the department of labor’s mandate,” murray wrote.

" former illinois governor rod blagojevich lost his latest bid for leniency as a federal appeals court refused to shorten his 14 year prison term in a vast public corruption case, including an effort to sell barack obama’s u.s. senate seat. the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals in chicago dismissed arguments that blagojevich deserved a lesser punishment because he had been a “model prisoner” in the five years he has already spent in prison and because some counts in his original 2011 conviction had been thrown out. friday’s 3 0 decision came three days after oral arguments, suggesting little or no disagreement. it likely ends blagojevich’s chances at shortening his sentence. the one time contestant on donald trump’s “celebrity apprentice” could ask the entire 7th circuit or the u.s. supreme court to review his case, but both are long shots. leonard goodman, a lawyer for blagojevich, did not respond to requests for comment. he told the chicago tribune the decision was “incredibly sad and disappointing.” the office of acting u.s. attorney joel levin in chicago declined to comment. blagojevich, 60, was convicted on charges including wire fraud, extortion and soliciting bribes while governor. he served from january 2003 to january 2009, when the illinois senate removed him from office. prosecutors said blagojevich solicited campaign contributions in exchange for raising pediatric reimbursement rates and legislation supporting illinois’ horse racing industry. blagojevich also tried to sell or trade the senate seat that obama vacated after winning the 2008 u.s. presidential election, prosecutors said. the appeals court in 2015 voided five of blagojevich’s 18 convictions and ordered a resentencing, but u.s. district judge james zagel in chicago reimposed the 14 year term last august. zagel acknowledged the pain blagojevich’s family was suffering but said the punishment reflected federal guidelines and that “the fault lies with the governor.” in friday’s decision, circuit judge frank easterbrook said zagel acted within his discretion. “blagojevich’s treatment of fellow inmates may show that outside of office he is an admirable person, but the court was entitled to impose punishment that reflects how blagojevich behaved when he had a different menu of opportunities and to deter those who hold office today,” easterbrook wrote. easterbrook also said the supreme court’s voiding last june of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell’s bribery convictions did not undermine blagojevich’s conviction. blagojevich is housed in a low security prison in littleton, colorado, and eligible for release in may 2024.

" michael moore, the left wing filmmaker known for provocative documentaries that deliver a biting message, will release an anti donald trump movie on tuesday as hollywood ramps up efforts to support democratic white house contender hillary clinton in the final weeks of the 2016  election campaign. moore, the oscar winning maker of documentaries about guns, the iraq war and the u.s. health system, said on twitter he would release “michael moore in trumpland” in a free screening in manhattan on tuesday night at one movie theater, followed by commercial release in theaters in los angeles and new york on wednesday. the film’s release comes three weeks before the nov. 8 election. the film is based on a one man show, “october surprise,”  that moore, a vocal critic of the republican presidential contender, recently performed in ohio and shows moore “dive right into hostile territory,” according to a brief description. the film is being released as scores of celebrities rally round clinton ahead of the nov. 8 election. more than 30, including barbra streisand, billy crystal, julia roberts, helen mirren and lena dunham, staged a fundraising show on broadway on monday with tickets that sold for up $10,000 each and which was streamed live online. singer jennifer lopez and rocker jon bon jovi will play separate get out the vote gigs in florida next week on behalf of clinton’s campaign. “iron man” star robert downey jr. and actors neil patrick harris, don cheadle and julianne moore are among those asking americans to “save the day” in a social media campaign aimed at getting people to vote against republican businessman and former reality star trump. clinton counts more, and more vocal, celebrity supporters than trump, whose backers include clint eastwood, jon voight, country singer loretta lynn, kirstie alley and rapper azealia banks. but fans of celebrities are not necessarily fans of the candidate they support. comedian amy schumer was booed at her stand up show in florida on sunday after she attacked trump and republican voters, causing some 200 audience members to walk out, according to the tampa bay times.

" french finance minister bruno le maire will meet german officials in berlin this week to discuss the future of the euro zone and assess his own prospects of becoming the next chairman of the eurogroup forum of finance ministers. french and german officials confirmed le maire would be in berlin on wednesday, when he will meet acting finance minister peter altmaier, a close ally of german chancellor angela merkel. le maire is also due to see christian lindner, leader of the liberal free democrats (fdp), and cem oezdemir, co leader of the greens party. both are in discussions with merkel s conservatives on forming a coalition government. france s emmanuel macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five year presidency. but any changes will require the support of merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before christmas. lindner has been critical of macron s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.   we want to follow up on the president s sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,  a french finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by macron in september when he laid out his vision for eu reform. while le maire s visit   his first to berlin since the german election   is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out berlin on the eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month. since it was created in 2005, the eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: luxembourg s jean claude juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former dutch finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in january. the position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. the post has been dubbed  mr euro . le maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. but some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either germany or france, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking. a further complication for le maire is france s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. german officials are not ruling out le maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country. last week, one official in berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: pierre gramegna of luxembourg and peter kazimir of slovakia. the official also floated the idea of extending dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of berlin, even though he is not part of the new dutch government.  it is still quite unclear who will come forward,  the german official said when asked about the presidency.  at this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. there is no natural candidate.  the eurogroup president will be chosen on dec. 4, an eu official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid november.  it is not a done thing,  the german official said of le maire s candidacy.  he will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.     the talks in berlin on wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring. if le maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. mario draghi will end his term as president of the european central bank on oct. 31, 2019, and germany s jens weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor. euro zone watchers say that if the french secure the presidency of the eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a german candidate taking over the ecb. still, as one senior french official told reuters on condition of anonymity last month, weidmann at the helm of the ecb  would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for france .

"here s the background:on january 11, 2017, the media reported on the existence of a private intelligence dossier containing unverified allegations of misconduct and ties between then president-elect donald trump and the russian government. the dossier was written by a former british mi6 intelligence agent, christopher steele, who went into hiding after the release of the dossier.the media and the intelligence community have stressed that accusations in the dossier have not been verified. most experts treated the dossier with skepticism and caution. trump himself has denounced the report, calling it  fake news  and  phony.  a russian government spokesman dismissed the dossier, saying its allegations were false.the document alleges that the russian federal security service (fsb) has kompromat on trump   damaging or embarrassing material which could be used to blackmail him, including allegations about trump s sexual and financial activities in russia. the dossier also states that the russian government promoted trump s candidacy to create divisions in western alliances, and that during his presidential campaign there was exchange of information between russian sources and people associated with trump s campaign.the dossier was produced as part of opposition research during the 2016 united states presidential election. the research was initially funded by republicans who did not want trump to be the republican party nominee for president. after trump won the primaries, a democratic client took over the funding; and, following trump s election, steele continued working on the report pro bono.in a monday letter to fbi director james comey, grassley asked for records pertaining to any agreements the agency may have had with christopher steele. the mi6 agent wrote an explosive memo on behalf of trump s political enemies alleging that the russians had compromising information on the president.comey briefed trump on the existence of the memo in a private meeting in january.shortly after, several news organizations published the unverified allegations, which the white house denied.in late february, the washington post reported that the fbi reached an agreement with steele whereby the british spy would continue his investigation on behalf of the bureau.read more the hill",1
" r. alexander acosta was confirmed on thursday by the u.s. senate to head the labor department, making him the first hispanic member of president donald trump’s cabinet. acosta, a former member of the national labor relations board and dean of the florida international university college of law in miami, was nominated as labor secretary by trump in mid february. the senate confirmed acosta by a 60 38 vote. acosta was expected to have a smooth confirmation process despite objections from some democrats and workers groups that he is too friendly to business. acosta has had a decades long career in the public sector, including multiple senate vettings for past appointments, making it unlikely any surprises in his background would derail his nomination. acosta served on the nlrb under former republican president george w. bush, who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the justice department’s civil rights division. he was then appointed u.s. attorney for the southern district of florida, where he went after high profile defendants such as jack abramoff and ubs (ubsg.s)(ubs.n), resulting in the swiss bank paying more than $750 million in fines for a tax avoidance scheme. acosta had served as a law clerk to samuel alito from 1994 to 1995, when the conservative supreme court justice was a judge at the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals. acosta told the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions during his confirmation hearing that he had reservations about key obama era labor regulations. acosta supported the recent 60 day delay of the labor department’s fiduciary rule, originally slated to take effect on april 10, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients’ interest first. trump had directed the labor department to review the rule to determine whether it is burdensome and out of step with current white house policies. also during the confirmation hearing, acosta expressed reservations about another obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year. the rule, which extended overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers, was blocked by a federal judge in november. acosta said he had “serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place.” ",0
" the u.s. republican party on sunday confronted its biggest crisis in more than 40 years when its presidential nominee, donald trump, faced a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women in a newly uncovered 2005 video. only a month before the nov. 8 election and on a day when trump was due to debate democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, trump took to social media to squelch any speculation that he would leave the race. “tremendous support (except for some republican leadership”). thank you,” trump wrote on twitter. then in a last minute surprise in st. louis, host city for the town hall debate, trump called journalists into a hotel room to witness a meeting he held with four women who revived accusations of past sexual misdeeds by clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton. the party turmoil recalled past party crises, including the watergate scandal that led to republican president richard nixon’s resignation in 1974. a businessman turned politician previously best known to americans as a reality tv show host, trump, 70, faced his latest crisis when on friday the 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife, melania. the controversy pitched trump, 70, into the biggest crisis of his 16 month old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment republicans. on sunday, he struck a defiant tone in the face of calls for him to abandon the race. a source close to the campaign of trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, dismissed talk among some political analysts the indiana governor might bolt the ticket in the uproar over trump’s comments. “absolutely not,” the source told reuters. at a democratic campaign event in chicago, president barack obama weighed in on the controversy, saying trump had been degrading not only to women, but to minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths, and the disabled. obama said that “tells you he is insecure.” “he pumps himself up by putting other people down,” obama said. with republican party leaders in crisis mode and doubts emerging over trump’s ability to draw support from crucial undecided voters, there were nonetheless some early signs many of his core supporters would remain loyal. a public opinion poll by politico/morning consult, taken just after news broke of the video, found 39 percent of voters thought trump should withdraw, and 45 percent said he should stay. of those who said trump should leave, only 12 percent identified themselves as republicans. as of sunday afternoon, at least 160 of the united states’ 332 sitting republican governors, senators and house of representatives members had condemned trump’s remarks, according to a reuters review of official statements and local news coverage. at least 30 had called for him to withdraw from the race and three other officeholders said he should consider doing so. eight of those said they were withdrawing their endorsement as well. those facing a difficult re election were more likely to speak out. all but six of the 40 republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive had condemned trump’s comments on the video, although only three members of that group called for him to drop out. any attempt to replace trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.  the trump campaign was battling back, circulating “talking points” to a core of high profile republicans who promote trump in the news media. the points sought to undermine establishment republicans who have abandoned trump. “they are more concerned with their political future than they are about the future of the country,” said a copy of the talking points, described to reuters by two sources close to the campaign. a real estate developer making his first run at public office, trump has made his battle against the establishment a central campaign theme. “phones have been blowing up for the past 24 hours,” said a prominent republican political operative in washington, referring to a heavy volume of calls among party officials and republican members of congress.    down ballot races the operative, who did not want to be identified, said trump’s troubles could steer campaign donations away from him and to republican candidates for congress and other down ballot offices. the source said trump could help himself most during the presidential debate   the second of three before the election   if he addressed the video and an oct. 1 new york times report that he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared $916 million loss in 1995 that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. despite having recovered from a string of setbacks, trump had an uphill battle to win the white house. before the video surfaced, a reuters/ipsos poll had clinton leading by 5 points on friday. the question now is whether trump’s quest for the presidency has been dealt a lethal blow.

" u.s. president donald trump’s reelection campaign released its first television advertisement on sunday, a 30 second spot that attacks democrats and touts the accomplishments of his first seven months in office.  the ad’s release comes amid intense criticism of trump’s response to the events in charlottesville, virginia, where a planned rally by white supremacists led to violence that killed a counter protester. speaking on saturday from his golf resort in bedminster, new jersey, trump stopped short of calling the demonstrators “white supremacists” and instead criticized groups on “many sides.” even members of his own party said he had failed to adequately condemn those behind the violence. the new advertisement uses the same video clips, still images and font as one released earlier this year by america first policies, a political group that is able to secretly raise and spend unlimited sums of money.  trump’s campaign and america first policies are prohibited by law from coordinating with each other.  trump filed for reelection the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the november 2020 election. historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally. trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how much money it was spending on the ad, where it was running or why it decided to release it this weekend.     the ad says trump has created jobs and helped the stock market since taking office. “the president’s enemies don’t want him to succeed, but americans are saying, ‘let president trump do his job,’” the advertisement states.  trump continues to struggle with low approval numbers, and the television ad could be an attempt to bolster his support. his campaign has raised more than $12 million since the beginning of the year.  “this new campaign ad speaks directly to the american people and sets the record straight, reminding them that president donald trump will not stop fighting for them and will not allow anyone to stand in his way to deliver success for them,” campaign manager michael glassner said in a statement announcing the ad.

" the european union is seeking to reopen its embassy in libya pending security conditions, officials said on tuesday, offering further political support for the tripoli government struggling to establish control. eu leaders will announce at their summit in brussels on oct. 19 20 that they  encourage work underway to rapidly establish a permanent eu presence in libya , according to their draft joint statement seen by reuters. but the statement makes clear no such move is imminent as it would be conditional on improving the security situation on the ground. the eu moved its mission to neighboring tunisia in mid 2014 as security worsened in libya amid escalating fighting between rival factions since the 2011 fall of longtime leader muammar gaddafi, ousted by rebels during a nato bombing campaign.  of 28 eu states, only italy, libya s former colonial master and still the most influential european state on the ground, has an embassy in the country, where the united nations has officially recognized the government of fayez seraj. the eu has also engaged increasingly with seraj, especially as it sought libya s help in curbing the flow of african refugees and migrants, hundreds of thousands of whom have been boarding smugglers  boats on the coast of the lawless state to cross the mediterranean for europe.  the bloc has financed, equipped and trained libya s border and coast guards, despite rights groups sounding alarm over grave abuses refugees and migrants suffer in libya.

" lawmakers in british prime minister theresa may s conservative party who are trying to oust her as leader have been told to  shut up  by senior party members, including potential rival boris johnson, britain s foreign minister. others in the party warned that the uncertainty over may was damaging brexit negotiations with the european union. may on friday said she would remain as leader after a   former conservative chairman said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted her to quit. it followed a disastrous speech at the party s conference earlier this week, when a persistent cough left may barely able to deliver her message, and a snap election in june in which may lost her party s majority in parliament. senior figures have rallied round may, but the open rebellion coincides with crucial talks with the european union just 18 months before britain is due to leave. johnson, who is widely considered to be the most serious challenger for leadership of the conservatives if may were to resign, called for unity, according to media reports.  we have just had an election and people are fed up with this malarkey,  newspapers quoted him as saying in a message to conservative lawmakers.   get behind the pm. ordinary punters i have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold,  he said.  circle the wagons, turn the fire on (opposition labour party leader jeremy) corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country . eu partners are stepping up preparations for a collapse in brexit negotiations due to fundamental divisions across britain on what to ask for   even if few believe britain would risk crashing out into legal limbo in march 2019.  in brussels, officials are questioning whether may will survive even until a summit on oct. 19, but diplomats said governments insisted they would not ease their demands to help her move on with talks on a post brexit transition. few of her 27 eu counterparts see either hardline brexiter rivals such as johnson or the labour opposition of corbyn as any better able to rally the country behind their own visions for brexit. scottish conservative leader ruth davidson, a possible successor should may be forced out and who campaigned hard against brexit last year, told the bbc the prime minister s critics should  put up, shut up and get off the stage .  i would tell my party to get its house in order, get together, knuckle down, and make sure that our first commitment, last commitment and only commitment is to the country,  she said.  her message came after former party chairman grant shapps toured media studios calling for a leadership election. shapps said 30 conservative lawmakers backed his view, well short of the 48 needed to trigger a contest. commentators said deep divisions in the party over the direction of brexit meant the rebellion had lost momentum despite disquiet over may s performance as leader.  one conservative lawmaker, nigel evans, said the  botched plot  appeared to have fizzled out within 24 hours but that it would play into the hands of eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier and eu commission head jean claude juncker.  may s weakness is generating more concern than satisfaction in brussels, however, since failing to reach a deal with london would disrupt economies on both sides of the english channel. barnier s team starts a new week of talks with british negotiators on monday, though expectations are very low of a breakthrough that could prompt leaders to open the way in the following week for talks on a post brexit free trade deal   something london insists should be a priority for both sides. underscoring a hard line among governments, including heavyweights such as germany and france, that britain must do more to settle immediate  divorce  issues, such as paying brussels tens of billions of euros, before opening a new phase of talks, envoys told barnier on friday they opposed starting even a tentative exploration of transitional arrangements. negotiators have suggested that, with time tight, it could be useful to explore some of the immediate problems that will come up on march 30, 2019, when britain is out. however, leaders could still agree to let barnier look at some transition issues, depending on next week s negotiating round, diplomats said. adding to low expectations, however, the schedule for talks is thinner than previous rounds, with no public meeting planned at the start between barnier and brexit secretary david davis and no negotiations taking place at all on wednesday. for now, european leaders can do little more than watch and speculate about may s ability to govern.  who knows if we will still have an interlocutor at the summit,  one official said.

" south carolina lawmakers have introduced a measure that would require transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their sex at birth, disregarding a growing outcry for a repeal of a similar provision enacted last month in north carolina. legislation such as the bill proposed in the republican controlled state senate on wednesday has fueled a national debate, with states entrenched on either side of the issue and major companies calling for a rollback on measures restricting transgender rights. the south carolina measure would prohibit local governments from requiring private businesses to provide restroom access based on gender identity rather than birth gender. “men should use the men’s room, and women should use the women’s room   that’s just common sense,” republican senator lee bright, a sponsor of the bill, told the state newspaper. “north carolina is getting so much flak over what is common sense.” the south carolina measure is narrower than north carolina’s law, which precludes local governments from adopting anti discrimination ordinances with protections based on gender identity and sexual orientation. but opponents warned the new proposal could spark the economic backlash seen this week in north carolina, where   paypal holdings inc cited the discriminatory nature of the law in canceling a new operations center that was to employ 400 workers in charlotte. more than 130 business leaders, including the chief executives of bank of america, herbalife and american airlines, have signed a letter with the human rights campaign calling for a repeal. “government simply has no place in our bathrooms,” said jeff ayers, executive director of south carolina equality, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group. pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed two executive orders on thursday aimed at safeguarding the rights of transgender people. one of them bans the state from discriminating against any employee or job applicant based on a host of criteria including “gender expression or identity.”  “this is the right thing to do. ... this is also the smart thing to do,” wolf said, citing paypal’s decision in north carolina.  last year, the democratic governor named a transgender woman as the state’s physician general, a cabinet level post.   more than a dozen states have considered bathroom provisions this year that would restrict access for transgender people, according to the national conference of state legislatures.    the measures come amid a wave of legislation pushed by social conservatives after the u.s. supreme court legalized same sex marriage last year. mississippi’s republican governor on tuesday signed a law allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same sex couples and permitting employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access. in response, a number of governors and mayors have banned non essential government travel to mississippi or north carolina. last week, the governors of georgia and virginia vetoed “religious liberty” bills, which critics said discriminated against same sex couples.

" the former finance minister under brazil s luiz inacio lula da silva on wednesday accused the ex president of receiving bribes from contractor odebrecht [odbes.ul], adding to a list of corruption accusations that threaten lula s ability to run for president in 2018. lawyers for the former finance minister, antonio palocci, said he told prosecutors that lula accepted odebrecht s purchase of land for an institute in his name, a country house in sao paulo state and 300 million reais ($97 million) to be used after he left office. a representative for lula said in a statement that palocci, who was arrested a year ago in a corruption investigation, was lying and making accusations without evidence to secure a favorable deal with prosecutors to reduce his sentence. such testimony from a close confidant could be damning for lula, who intends to run for president again next year if he can successfully appeal a conviction that would bar him from standing. lula faces four additional trials. separately on wednesday, brazil s top prosecutor, rodrigo janot, charged lula, ex president dilma rousseff and a former minister with obstruction of justice related to lula s nomination as rousseff s chief of staff in 2016. the nomination, later struck down by the supreme court, would have shielded lula from prosecution by lower courts. it was the second charge from janot in two days. on tuesday he accused lula, rousseff and six other members of their workers party for allegedly forming a criminal organization to carry out corruption and other crimes involving state controlled oil company petrobras. lula and rousseff deny the charges. palocci leveled his accusations in two hours of testimony on wednesday as part of a probe into allegations that lula accepted the land for the institute.   it was a blood pact and a package of bribes that included payment for a property, an estate ranch and 300 million reais that gradually were made available according to a spreadsheet delivered by the contractor,  said adriano bretas, one of palocci s lawyers. tracy reinaldet, another of palocci s lawyers, said the agreement was made during the transition from lula into rousseff s first term. palocci also served as rousseff s chief of staff initially but was forced to resign due to corruption allegations.

" officials in new york and los angeles on thursday said they hoped president elect donald trump would not follow through on a campaign promise to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” that shield people who are in the country illegally. the nation’s two largest cities have sharply limited their cooperation with u.s. immigration authorities seeking to deport undocumented immigrants. president barack obama’s administration has used so called detainer requests to target undocumented immigrants convicted of criminal acts, especially violent ones. new york and los angeles do not hold undocumented inmates in jail at the request of the u.s. department of immigration and customs enforcement (ice) unless the detainer request is accompanied by a judge’s order, officials said. trump said during a debate with democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton in october he would seek to deport major drug dealers. “we have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out,” he said.  trump early in his campaign pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states and also threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities. new york mayor bill de blasio said at a news conference on thursday that new york would continue to defend undocumented immigrants. “we are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us, who are part of our community,” de blasio said, referring to an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants living in new york. “we are not going to tear families apart.”  de blasio said trump’s threat to withhold funds from sanctuary cities was “dangerous,” but it was too soon to tell whether the president elect intended to follow through on all his proposals. a spokeswoman for trump did not return emails or a call. in los angeles, a spokeswoman for mayor eric garcetti also voiced hopes over how trump would proceed on the issue. “we comply with federal immigration agencies, but insist that detainer requests be handled constitutionally,” connie llanos, the spokeswoman, said in an email.  “it is mayor garcetti’s sincere hope that no president would violate those principles, the very foundation of our nation, by taking punitive action on cities that are simply protecting the well being of residents.”  california is one of five states that limit compliance with ice detainer requests and similar policies are in place at 37 cities nationwide, according to the immigrant legal resource center. last month, a federal judge in illinois found the ice detainer requests were unconstitutional, but the ruling did not apply nationwide.

" for an estimated 300,000 rohingya muslims living in squalor in pakistan s largest city, the news from myanmar in the past two weeks is reviving  painful memories of the violence that drove many of them here half a century ago.  some say they have got word of relatives being killed in myanmar s rakhine state or are not being able to contact family members.  karachi s rohingya community comprises migrants from an earlier era of displacement dating back to the 1960s and  70s. despite decades in a foreign land, they have stayed in touch with family back home, especially in recent years through mobile phones and social media.  in the past two weeks, nearly 300,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh after the myanmar military launched an offensive in response to a series of attacks by rohingya insurgents on police posts and an army base. hundreds of homes in rohingya villages have been burned and about 400 people have been killed.  the older members of karachi s rohingya community fled from a repressive military regime that took power in 1962, escaping on foot or by boat to bangladesh, which was then east pakistan. eventually, they made their way to karachi. most of the people living in the slum called arakanabad were born in pakistan, or fled violence in their homeland decades ago. it s named for arakan, which was what rakhine used to be called. raheela sadiq, a more recent migrant who came to pakistan 15 years ago, said she has been unable to contact relatives in rakhine via mobile phone for nearly two weeks.   i have seen what is happening to people over there on the internet,  she said as tears filled her eyes. videos and pictures depicting violence in rakhine and shared on social media are passed around quickly in arakanabad, adding to fears and anxiety about relatives back home.  fisherman noor mohammed, 50, said three members of his  family in rakhine were killed a few days ago.   my brother, brother in law, and nephew were there (in rakhine). they are all dead now. the army over there killed them,  he said, adding that he heard the news from another nephew who is still alive.   hoor bahar, 60, said she left rakhine with her husband over 30 years ago when her mother and sister were killed.   i have one sister left who went to bangladesh seven to 10 days ago,  she added. however, she said, her sister is being held on a beach by boatmen who brought her from rakhine and are demanding $350 as payment. arakanabad smells of fish. the rohingya who live here largely work on fishing boats, or clean the catch brought by fishermen who set sail from the nearby korangi creek.  most of them say they are not able to obtain pakistani identity cards, essential for opening bank accounts, enrolling children in schools, using public hospitals, and even getting a job.  fishing boats, where identity cards are not asked for, are one of the few employment options left although fishermen can sometimes be asked for identification by coast guards.   there is no policy in pakistan for the rohingya,  said noor hussain, the pakistan head of the rohingya solidarity organization, pointing out that the without state issued identity cards the community cannot progress. thousands of rohingya families are crammed into the one room cement brick houses that line the narrow streets of arakanabad.  children play amidst knee high garbage, and crowd around to share slices of jello topped with sugar, or other sweetmeats sold by hawkers.   the community is living in extremely difficult circumstances, and our youth is being destroyed because they cannot get an education,  said hussain. despite the poverty, the community raised around 1.5 million rupees ($15,000) over the eid al adha holidays earlier this month to help refugees fleeing rakhine.   our community is not a burden on pakistan,  hussain said.   the government of pakistan is making millions of dollars by exporting the fish our people catch,  he said, adding that  giving citizenship rights to the rohingya would only benefit the country.

" president donald trump is set to sign an order to greatly reduce the role climate change plays in decision making across the u.s. government, bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the administration’s plan. the order, which could be signed this week, aims to reverse former democratic president barack obama's broad approach for addressing climate change, the report said. (bloom.bg/2nkdvko) the directive will urge the u.s. environmental protection agency to undo the clean power plan, the bloomberg report said. the clean power plan is obama’s centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several republican states. according to the report, the measure would direct u.s. regulators to rescind obama era regulations limiting oil industry emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. the order will also involve a reconsideration of the government’s use of a metric known as the “social cost of carbon”, which weighs the potential economic damage from climate change, bloomberg reported on tuesday. trump has long signaled his intention to reverse obama’s climate change initiatives, but the republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize america’s water and air quality. reuters reported earlier this month that the white house had proposed to slash a quarter of the epa’s budget, targeting climate change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination. the bloomberg report said that some of the changes could happen immediately, while others could take years to implement.

" a man was jailed for 10 years for rape by a swedish court on thursday for forcing 27 children from the united states, canada and britain to perform sex acts on themselves or with other children that he viewed over the internet.  the case, heard in uppsala, marked the first time in sweden that a person has been convicted of rape without having met the victim   setting a precedent for such crimes over the internet to be treated as seriously as if they were committed in person.  the district court makes a very important assessment here. it states clearly what is required for an act performed by a girl on her own body to be regarded as rape when the perpetrator is not in the same room,  prosecutor annika wennerstrom told tt news agency.  this may lead to a different level of priority and status from the police in criminal investigations with these types of crimes.   the 41 year old swede found the girls via social media and threatened to rape them and kill their families unless they committed the sex acts on themselves, on other children or with animals.  the children, most under the age of 15, either streamed the acts to the man over the internet or recorded them and sent them later.  the man was also sentenced for a large number of acts of online sexual abuse of children and child pornography.  as a result of this case, wennerstrom said the means of investigation and the penalties could change.  we will be given the opportunity to use other types of methods with this legal classification, penalties will be longer and the chances for compensation for victims will increase,  she said.

" somali government forces have regained control of a town on the border with kenya after al shabaab militants stormed an army base there on monday, causing heavy clashes in which at least 17 people died, the military said.  islamist insurgents attacked the base at balad hawo early in the morning with a car suicide bombing before entering the compound, both sides said.  we were awoken by a suicide car bomb this morning and then fierce battle followed,  major mohamed abdullahi told reuters from the town.  we chased al shabaab out of the town,  he said. al shabaab spokesman abdiasis abu musab said the group s fighters left the town after releasing 35 prisoners from the local jail. at least 30 soldiers were killed, he said. according to the military official, at least 10 soldiers and seven al shabaab militants were killed, though the death toll on both sides could still rise. formed in 2006, al shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and impose its strict interpretation of islam. somalia has been at war since 1991 when clan based warlords overthrew dictator siad barre and then turned on each other. al shabaab carry out frequent attacks on security and government targets, but also on civilians. they also target african union peacekeeping troops.  residents confirmed fighting had ended and that the militants had left the town.   now balad hawo is calm and government forces fully control it,  ahmed hassan, a resident of the town told reuters. hassan said he saw 13 bodies collected from the military base.

" deputy u.s. attorney general rod rosenstein will conduct a classified briefing on thursday, may 18 for the full u.s. senate on president donald trump’s firing of fbi director james comey, a spokesman for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on monday. the top democrat in the senate, chuck schumer, said in a statement he hoped senators would use the briefing at 2:30 p.m. edt (1830 gmt) to seek the “full truth” about comey’s dismissal, press rosenstein “to make way” for a special prosecutor and ensure the administration preserves and makes public any audio recordings of his conversations with comey. critics have assailed trump for abruptly firing comey, who was leading the federal bureau of investigation’s probe into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and possible ties between moscow and the trump campaign. russia denies it sought to interfere in the election. trump has dismissed such talk as little more than sour grapes by democrats who cannot accept his upset victory on nov. 8. democrats have been calling for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate, saying getting to the bottom of foreign interference in the u.s. election is too important to leave to potentially partisan committees in congress. comey’s firing last week added to the worries, and even some of trump’s fellow republicans have expressed concern about the timing of his dismissal. the top democrat in the house of representatives, nancy pelosi, said she has asked republican house speaker paul ryan to request a similar briefing for the house. there was no immediate word from ryan’s office. however, administration officials typically do not conduct such briefings for only one of the two chambers.

" oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, u.s. president elect donald trump’s choice to lead the environmental protection agency, said on wednesday he will review the obama administration’s recent decision to lock in fuel efficiency rules. on friday, outgoing epa administrator gina mccarthy finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by president barack obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration’s climate legacy. “it merits review and i would review that,” pruitt said during a contentious senate confirmation hearing, questioning the decision of mccarthy to finalize the determination just two weeks after the public comment period closed on dec. 30.  pruitt said separately he would not commit to allowing california to continue its own clean vehicle rules under a 2009 decision by the obama administration. major u.s. and foreign automakers have appealed to trump, who has been critical of obama’s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. as part of a 2012 regulation, epa had to decide by april 2018 whether to modify the 2022 2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. in 2011, obama announced an agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. this, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.     the epa said in july that because americans were buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. in november, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. mccarthy said her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rested on an extensive technical record. she said the rules are “feasible, practical and appropriate” and in “the best interests of the auto industry.” senator james inhofe, an oklahoma republican, on wednesday said mccarthy’s determination was an “extreme action” that “broke the deal” with automakers. legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the trump administration and congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the obama administration during its final months in office. the 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the epa under trump would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing it and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if that step was taken. separately. california’s new democrat senator kamala harris asked pruitt whether he would commit to upholding the california waiver. pruitt did not say outright that he would uphold the waiver, which allows california to pursue its own emission standards that are more stringent than the federal rules.

" president donald trump on tuesday nominated neil gorsuch for a lifetime job on the u.s. supreme court, picking the 49 year old federal appeals court judge to restore the court’s conservative majority and help shape rulings on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, the death penalty and religious rights. the colorado native faces a potentially contentious confirmation battle in the u.s. senate after republicans last year refused to consider democratic president barack obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the february 2016 death of conservative justice antonin scalia. the senate’s top democrat, chuck schumer, indicated his party would mount a procedural hurdle requiring 60 votes in the 100 seat senate rather than a simple majority to approve gorsuch, and expressed “very serious doubts” about the nominee. liberal groups called for an all out fight to reject gorsuch while conservative groups and republican senators heaped praise on him like “outstanding,” “impressive” and a “home run.” gorsuch, the son of a former reagan administration official, is the youngest nominee to the nation’s highest court in more than a quarter century, and he could influence the direction of the court for decades. he is a judge on the denver based 10th u.s. circuit court of appeals and was appointed to that post by republican president george w. bush in 2006. announcing the selection to a nighttime crowd in the white house east room flanked by the judge and his wife, trump said gorsuch’s resume is “as good as it gets.” trump, who took office on jan. 20 and has sparked numerous controversies, said he hopes republicans and democrats can come together on this nomination for the good of the country. “judge gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support,” trump told an audience that included scalia’s widow. “depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years. and his or her decisions can last a century or more, and can often be permanent,” trump added. gorsuch is considered a conservative intellectual, known for backing religious rights and writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide, and is seen as very much in the mold of scalia, a leading conservative voice on the court for decades. “i respect ... the fact that in our legal order it is for congress and not the courts to write new laws,” gorsuch said, as trump looked on. “it is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.” a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the choice of gorsuch was seen by the white house as a significant departure from supreme court nominations from the recent past, given that many justices have come from the eastern united states. gorsuch lives in boulder, colorado, where he raises horses and is a life long outdoorsman. the official said a screening committee helped in the selection process that included vice president mike pence, white house counsel don mcgahn, chief of staff reince priebus and top strategist steve bannon. gorsuch became the youngest u.s. supreme court nominee since republican president george h.w. bush in 1991 selected conservative clarence thomas, who was 43 at the time. gorsuch was in the same 1991 graduating class from harvard law school as obama. the selection of gorsuch, who was on a list of about 20 judges suggested by conservative legal activists, unified republicans in a way not seen since trump’s nov. 8 election victory, with even critics within the party such as south carolina senator lindsey graham singing the nominee’s praises. trump made his choice between two u.s. appeals court judges, gorsuch and thomas hardiman of the philadelphia based 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals, according to a source involved in the selection process. the senate confirmed gorsuch for his current judgeship in 2006 by voice vote with no one voting against him. democrats signaled it may not be easy this time. “judge gorsuch has repeatedly sided with corporations over working people, demonstrated a hostility toward women’s rights, and most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong, independent justice on the court,” schumer said. trump got the opportunity to name scalia’s replacement only because the republican led senate, in an action with little precedent in u.s. history, refused to consider obama’s nominee for the post, appeals court judge merrick garland. obama nominated garland on march 16 but republican senators led by majority leader mitch mcconnell denied garland the customary confirmation hearings and vote. “this is the first time in american history that one party has blockaded a nominee for almost a year in order to deliver a seat to a president of their own party. if this tactic is rewarded rather than resisted, it will set a dangerous new precedent in american governance,” oregon democratic senator jeff merkley said. mcconnell said on tuesday he hoped the senate would show gorsuch “fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an up or down vote on his nomination, just like the senate treated the four first term nominees of (democratic) presidents (bill) clinton and obama.” a rally outside the supreme court building staged by liberal groups drew hundreds of demonstrators against gorsuch.  michael keegan, president of the liberal advocacy group people for the american way, described gorsuch as an “ideological warrior who puts his own right wing politics above the constitution.” gorsuch is the son of anne burford, the first woman to head the u.s. environmental protection agency. she served in republican president ronald reagan’s administration but resigned in 1983 amid a fight with congress over documents on the epa’s use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide. trump’s selection was one of the most consequential appointments of his young presidency as he moved to restore a conservative majority on the supreme court that had been in place for decades until scalia died at age 79 on feb. 13, 2016. trump’s fellow republicans hold a 52 48 senate majority, meaning some democratic votes would be needed to confirm his pick under current rules. trump said last week he would favor senate republicans eliminating the procedural move that democrats have promised, called a filibuster, for supreme court nominees if democrats block his pick. such a change has been dubbed the “nuclear option.”  trump has said his promise to appoint a conservative justice was one of the reasons he won the nov. 8 presidential election, with christian conservatives and others emphasizing the importance of the pick during the campaign. if confirmed, gorsuch would expand the court’s conservative wing, made up of john roberts, anthony kennedy samuel alito and thomas. kennedy long has been considered the court’s pivotal vote, sometimes siding with the liberals in key cases such as the june 2016 ruling striking down abortion restrictions in texas. the court’s restored conservative majority likely would be supportive toward the death penalty and gun rights and hostile toward campaign finance limits. scalia’s replacement also could be pivotal in cases involving abortion, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, voting rights, federal regulations others. gorsuch boasts ivy league credentials: attending columbia university and, like several of the other justices on the court, harvard law school. he also completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at oxford university, spent several years in private practice and worked in george w. bush’s justice department. gorsuch joined an opinion in 2013 saying that owners of private companies could object on religious grounds to a provision of the obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women. as long as kennedy and four liberals remain on the bench, the court is not expected to pare back abortion rights as many u.s. conservatives fervently hope. the supreme court legalized abortion in the landmark 1973 roe v. wade ruling. in june, the justices ruled 5 3 to strike down a texas law that restricted abortion access, with kennedy and the liberals in the majority. the current vacancy is the court’s longest since a 391 day void from 1969 to 1970 during republican richard nixon’s presidency. after abe fortas resigned from the court in may 1969, the senate voted down two nominees put forward by nixon before confirming harry blackmun, who became a justice in june 1970. aside from that one, no other supreme court vacancy since the u.s. civil war years of the 1860s has been as long as the current one. trump may get to make additional appointments. liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg, who trump called upon to resign last july after she called him “a faker,” is 83 while kennedy is 80. stephen breyer, another liberal, is 78.

" u.s. border patrol chief mark morgan has been asked to step down as the agency moves toward tougher enforcement of immigration laws under the trump administration, a department of homeland security official told reuters on thursday. morgan, a longtime former federal bureau of investigation official, is expected to leave his post by the end of the month, a spokesman for u.s. customs and border protection said.  president donald trump announced a broad plan to crack down on border security on wednesday, including directing the construction of a wall along the border with mexico.  the border patrol union, which endorsed trump’s presidential campaign and applauded his executive orders, had been critical of morgan for supporting former president barack obama’s plans to safeguard certain undocumented immigrants from deportation.  the executive board of the national border patrol council called morgan arrogant and a “disgrace to the border patrol” in an opinion piece published by conservative website breitbart news on nov. 30. unlike many border patrol officers, morgan did not climb the chain of command within the agency but spent most of his career with the fbi. acting u.s. customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan issued a statement thanking morgan for his service.  “on behalf of the men and women of u.s. customs and border protection and the u.s. border patrol, i want to thank mark morgan for his unwavering dedication to our border security mission, and recognize his life long career in service to the nation,” the statement said.

" donald trump may have done just enough in sunday’s presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat   and that may have put republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position.  had trump imploded, the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent, increasing demands for him to drop out of the race.  but that didn’t happen. now, republicans who have seen their party torn apart by trump’s candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma: publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the white house.  the manhattan real estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate, hammering his democratic opponent hillary clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and again raising decades old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband bill clinton.  that likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat clinton in the nov. 8 election.  “his no holds barred approach to hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since bill clinton was in office,” said craig robinson, former political director of the iowa republican party. “the republican base and talk radio will love this performance.”  but the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women, college educated, and suburban voters. a recent reuters/ipsos poll showed close to 20 percent of americans were still undecided on which candidate to support. sixty percent of those were women.  a poll taken by cnn immediately following the debate showed republicans have reason to be anxious. viewers said clinton had beaten trump in the encounter, 57 percent to 34 percent.  the furor over the 2005 videotape, in which trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women, led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him, including arizona senator john mccain. their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of president richard nixon, a republican, in 1974.  the house republican conference, a body comprised of the almost 250 republicans in the u.s. house of representatives, was set to meet on monday to discuss the foundering trump campaign, a house leadership aide said. house speaker paul ryan pointedly disinvited trump for a joint appearance in wisconsin that had been scheduled for saturday following publication of the tape.  all but six of the 40 republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned trump’s comments in the video, although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out.  since the release of the video, the party’s governing body, the republican national committee, has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it.  “there hasn’t been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the rnc going forward,” said an rnc official who asked to remain unidentified.  the tape intensified talk in republican circles about diverting funds from trump to prop up house and senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash.  “it’s well past time to cut all ties with trump and focus on preserving the republican congress and down ballot offices. immediately,” said john weaver, a veteran republican strategist.  republican officials have another worry: that trump’s unpopularity may lead many republican voters to stay at home on election day.  against this backdrop of panic and condemnation, trump on sunday sought to rally the party’s base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about.  he offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the country’s chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage. he also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husband’s sexual history.  in doing so, trump may have stopped the bleeding, but he did nothing to stop the worrying.

" cambodian prime minister hun sen has pulled back from a threat to close a human rights group founded by the detained opposition leader kem sokha, a pro government website said on saturday. the move follows a visit by hun sen to cambodia s main ally china and comes as the veteran leader is under fire from western donors for a crackdown on the opposition. the rights group, the cambodian center for human rights, was founded in 2002 by kem sokha, who was arrested in september and charged with treason for an alleged plot to take power with american help.  the government decided to keep (cchr) so it continues to serve human rights activities in cambodia, and as a result of the ministry of interior s finding, there are no illegal acts,  hun sen was quoted as saying by freshnews. kem sokha has rejected the charges against him, which the opposition calls a ploy to ensure hun sen extends his more than three decades in power at next year s election. kem sokha s party, the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp), was dissolved on nov. 16 by the supreme court, acting at the government s request.  in response to the crackdown, the united states has stopped funding for the election and the european union has raised a potential threat to cambodia s duty free access if it does not respect human rights. the statement was released as hun sen held a two day ceremony at the famed angkor wat temple to pray for peace and stability in cambodia. he sat beside his wife bun rany and pressed his hands together while buddhist monks chanted prayers. mu sochua, a deputy to kem sokha who fled the crackdown in cambodia, said the nation s deep divisions could not be healed in one ceremony.  peace for cambodia can not be achieved through just a ceremony. peace is about full respect of human rights, freedoms, liberties and rule of law,  mu sochua told reuters. chak sopheap, executive director of the rights group cchr, said she and other staffs were  incredibly relieved  by the news.  with this investigation out of the way, we can get back to focusing on our core mission, the work of promoting respect for human rights in cambodia,  chak sopheap said in a facebook post.

" a second u.s. federal judge has blocked parts of president donald trump’s latest travel ban on people entering the united states from eight countries, dealing another legal blow to the administration’s third bid to impose travel restrictions. u.s. district judge theodore chuang in maryland, in a ruling issued overnight, said the policy as applied to six majority muslim countries likely violates the u.s. constitution’s prohibition on religious discrimination. he also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law. trump’s ban would have taken effect on wednesday but was blocked on tuesday by a u.s. federal judge in hawaii in a separate challenge.  together, the pair of rulings set up a high stakes battle over the president’s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the u.s. supreme court. trump’s latest order targeted people from iran, libya, syria, yemen, somalia, chad and north korea, as well as certain government officials from venezuela. neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on north korea and venezuela. in the maryland ruling, chuang questioned the government’s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the united states.  he cited various statements made by trump, including his 2015 call for a “total and complete shutdown on muslims entering the united states.” chuang wrote that the president’s public statements “not only fail to advance, but instead undermine, the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies.”  the latest ban, announced last month, was the third version of a policy that targeted muslim majority countries but had been restricted by the courts. the maryland case was brought by the american civil liberties union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the international refugee assistance project. “like the two versions before it, president trump’s latest travel ban is still a muslim ban at its core. and like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts,” said aclu lawyer omar jadwat. on tuesday, u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu said hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy  violated federal immigration law. the white house called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal. unlike the hawaii ruling, the maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the united states. white house representatives had no immediate comment.

" members of germany s social democrats (spd) and chancellor angela merkel s conservatives argued on wednesday about repatriating syrian refugees accused of crimes, a potential foretaste of coalition negotiations on immigration. migration will be a key issue in coalition talks after an influx of more than a million migrants since mid 2015 hurt both the two major german parties in the september election and helped the anti immigration alternative for germany (afd).  the spd criticized a proposal by conservative politicians to deport syrian refugees who commit crimes, accusing the conservative party of moving to the right, rnd newspaper group reported on wednesday. earlier this month, the afd called for the repatriation of all the half a million syrian refugees living in germany, saying the war there was nearly over.  the conservative interior minister of saxony state, markus ulbig, proposed deporting syrian refugees who commit offences after evaluating the security situation in their home country, rnd reported earlier. ulbig s proposal, was supported by other regional interior ministers who will meet next week to discuss whether the situation in syria merits a new status in order to consider sending syrians back, starting from the end of june 2018.  we have always said: we want to respond to the developments in syria,  said the spokesman of the head of christian democrats in mecklenburg western pomerania.  now we have to ensure in the medium term that people return to their homeland.  the spd said a halt to deportations for syrian asylum seekers should be extended at least until the end of 2018.  now thinking about sending people to this country as quickly as possible   as the conservatives proposed  is cynical and inhuman,  said eva hoegl, a senior spd politician. a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, which is led by spd politician sigmar gabriel, noted that the conflict was still ongoing, suggesting that it was premature to talk about a new security assessment for the country. hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million driven from their homes in syria s civil war, now in its seventh year. the situation on the ground has changed in the last two years since russia joined the war on the side of the government, helping it recapture most rebel held territory.

" u.s. president barack obama has warned that attacks on police over racial bias would hurt the anti racism black lives matter movement, days after a sniper killed five police officers in dallas in apparent revenge for police shootings of black people.  obama said although most activists from the black lives matter movement wanted to see better relations between communities and law enforcement, violence and overly broad criticism against police undermined the protest movement. “i want to say to say to everyone concerned about ... racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful, serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize american society to bring about real change,” obama said. “whenever those of us who are concerned about failures of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause,” he told a news conference in madrid where he is on a one day visit.  micah johnson, a black u.s. military veteran of the afghan war, opened fire on police officers on thursday during a protest in dallas against the fatal shootings of two black men by police in louisiana and minnesota the previous day. johnson wanted to “kill white people, especially white officers,” dallas police chief david brown said after the attack on thursday night. the black lives matter group said on friday it advocated dignity, not murder, in response to the shooting that also left seven other police officers and two civilians wounded. obama said there was legitimate criticism to be made of the criminal justice system and that citizens should continue to protest against it. “i would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustrations that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests as political correctness or politics or attacks on police,” he said.

" jacob zuma told south africa s parliament on thursday he had received no payments from private companies or individuals during his time as president, as opposition lawmakers walked out in protest over the cost to the state of his legal fees.  allegations by government and opposition politicians that the wealthy gupta family of businessmen used a friendship with zuma to control state businesses and influence appointments are among many scandals that have dogged his presidency.      the guptas and zuma have denied any wrongdoing and say they are victims of a politically motivated witch hunt.  my government is committed to fighting corruption,  zuma said in response to a question. he also said he would establish a judicial commission to investigate allegations made in a 2016 report by south africa s corruption fighting public protector.   i did not receive any payments from private individuals or companies during my tenure as president of the republic of south africa, other than those disclosed or reported to the necessary authorities,  he said in answer to another question. the main opposition party then walked out of the session, saying zuma was refusing to answer questions on how much the state had spent on legal fees to fight corruption allegations against him. democratic alliance leader mmusi maimane had asked how much had been spent since may 1, 2009 to defend 783 corruption charges against zuma that were dropped by the national prosecuting authority (npa) before he ran for the presidency.  he is going to jail. the president is going to jail,  maimane shouted before leading the walkout. south africa s high court reinstated the charges last year and the supreme court upheld that decision in october, rejecting an appeal by zuma. the 75 year old president is still trying to prevent the npa from filing the charges. the  state of capture  report by the public protector, whose job is to uphold standards in public life, recommended a judicial probe into allegations of systemic corruption by zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state owned companies. but the president filed an application asking the high court to set aside the report, saying he would instead set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the allegations. the court is expected to rule on that case soon. zuma told parliament the judicial commission would investigate those corruption allegations and any others brought to its attention.  after the (high court) judgment, i will establish it immediately. we will prove the lies and the truths,  zuma said.  the truth will be found.   the report focused on allegations that zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers ajay, atul and rajesh gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers, which zuma and the guptas have denied.

" the top democrat on the u.s. senate committee overseeing pensions on monday asked the u.s. office of government ethics to assess whether president donald trump is violating the constitution and federal bans on conflicts of interest. reuters reported on april 26 that public pension funds in at least seven u.s. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale trump soho hotel and condominium in new york city and pays a trump company to run it, according to a reuters review of public records. “trump may be profiting from the retirement plans of millions of our nation’s public servants,” senator patty murray of washington state wrote in a letter to walter shaub, the director of the office of government ethics, citing the reuters report. the office of government ethics is the u.s. agency that oversees conduct within the executive branch and supervises ethics officials to ensure they are preventing conflicts of interest and other violations. “this looks like exactly the type of monetary flow prohibited by the constitution,” said the senator. murray, who is on the senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee, asked shaub to assess what steps trump can take to ensure he is in compliance with article ii of the u.s. constitution, which bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments.  the fees that public pension funds pay the cim fund iii investment fund that owns the trump soho may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told reuters. the white house, the trump organization, and the office of government ethics did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  at a january news conference at which trump said he would turn over management of his companies to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, his lawyer, sheri dillon, said divesting from his businesses would “exacerbate” potential conflicts of interest because trump would still be entitled to royalties from the use of his brand. some of the pension funds have said trump or the investment fund that owns the hotel should answer concerns about the chain because they do not have control over the assets in the investment fund’s portfolio. others declined to comment on the payment chain between them and trump.  other democratic u.s. senators have criticized the president for not divesting his hotel management company and the hundreds of other businesses that make up the trump organization. democratic senator ben cardin of maryland said trump was setting “an extremely dangerous precedent” by maintaining ownership.

" a portuguese court has handed long prison sentences to six members of a bogus religious cult that sexually abused boys, including their own children, under the pretence of rituals on a farm just southeast of lisbon. tuesday s verdict by the setubal district court sentenced rui pedro, the 36 year old leader of the self proclaimed celestial truth sect, to 23 years after finding him guilty of rape, procuring prostitution, child pornography and other crimes, a court official said on wednesday.  his wife and four other men were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 and 19 years. two women were acquitted. the crimes were committed between 2011 and 2015, mostly on a farm rented by the group in 2014. prosecutors told the court that the cult was fake, and its rituals set up as a means to lure and scare the children. the eight victims, including the leader s son and the son of another of the sentenced men, had been told that the sect s  master  had supernatural powers and could perform  acts of purification  on them, which was the term for sexual abuse. the boys, aged between 5 and 16 at the time of the crimes and mostly from the setubal area, were kept in fear of his powers so they never disclosed what happened to anyone.  their families had been led to believe the children played football or studied and received psychological counselling or religious guidance on the farm. police arrested the group in 2015 after one of the members, andre marques, reported them to the authorities. he was still sentenced to 19 years, as the court ruled that he had only cooperated  to save his own skin , daily newspaper publico reported.

" the virginia state senate on monday approved a bill making the  electric chair the default method of execution if lethal injection drugs are unavailable. the bill passed the republican controlled senate by a 22 17 vote. the republican dominated house has already approved the measure. after a lower chamber vote on a minor amendment, the measure will go to democratic governor terry mcauliffe for approval. a spokesman for the governor said the measure would be reviewed when it arrived. virginia is one of eight states that allows electrocution as a method of execution, letting condemned inmates choose between it and lethal injection. if they do not choose, lethal injection is used. virginia, along with other states, has struggled to get lethal injection drugs because pharmaceutical companies have protested their use in executions. the last death row inmate in virginia to choose the electric chair for execution was in 2013. inmate ricky gray, who killed six people in richmond in 2006, had been scheduled for execution on march 16, adding urgency to the legislative debate. gray’s execution has been postponed by the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals, pending a decision by the u.s. supreme court about whether to hear the case. gray has not indicated which method of execution he preferred. the legislation has fueled debate in virginia over whether capital punishment, especially the electric chair, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. “the electric chair is outdated and barbaric,” senator scott surovell, a democrat from northern virginia, said during a floor debate. he lost an effort to amend the bill by requiring the virginia department of corrections to explain in detail why it was not able to obtain lethal drugs before opting for electrocution. state senator mark obenshain, a republican from the shenandoah valley, argued that if the amendment passed it would have further delayed execution of death row inmates. “some (people) just have black hearts. they’re beyond redemption,” said obenshain, an unsuccessful republican  candidate for state attorney general in 2013.

" hawaii lawmaker beth fukumoto, ousted last month as republican leader of the state’s house of representatives after publicly criticizing president donald trump, resigned on wednesday from her party to seek membership as a democrat. fukumoto, 33, the youngest hawaii legislator to serve as house minority leader, said divisive campaign rhetoric during the 2016 elections convinced her the republican party no longer reflected her political values or the interests of her state’s diverse population. “this election, i saw members of my party marginalizing and condemning minorities, ethnic or otherwise, and making demeaning comments towards women,” she said in an open letter of resignation to the republican party.  fukumoto, who is of mixed japanese and irish ancestry, said she found trump’s comments about banning muslim immigrants and the possibility of establishing a registry of muslim americans to be especially troubling. “i wanted very badly to see the republican party denounce his comments, and that didn’t happen,” she told reuters, saying a muslim registry struck her as “one step away” from internment camps.  “that for me was the issue that really changed how i felt.” a self described political moderate, fukumoto was the first republican in 26 years to represent the largely middle class central oahu district outside honolulu, capital of the predominantly democratic state. she said she originally joined the republicans out of a sense that democrats were the status quo party, but she grew gradually disillusioned with the republicans. she recounted a fellow republican caucus member admonishing her last year that they should be considered the “party of middle america” despite hawaii’s diverse demographics. before making the switch, fukumoto sent out a questionnaire to constituents seeking their opinions. of those who replied, 76 percent said they would support her regardless, while most of the remainder opposed her changing parties, she said. first elected to the state legislature in 2012, fukumoto  became leader of the state’s tiny house republican caucus two years later, only to be removed by her peers in february of this year after she spoke out against trump during the women’s march in hawaii the day after his inauguration. as of wednesday, fukumoto, became the lone independent among 45 democrats and five remaining republicans in the state’s lower house, as she launches a process of applying for membership in the state’s majority party.

" the kremlin said on tuesday that u.s. charges against president donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort and another aide showed moscow had been unfairly maligned in accusations that it meddled in last year s u.s. presidential election. federal investigators probing alleged russian interference in the election, something moscow denies, charged manafort and rick gates with money laundering on monday. but despite being brought as part of a five month old investigation into alleged russian efforts to tilt the election in trump s favor and into potential collusion by trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on manafort s work for ukraine s former government, not russia s. that was welcomed in russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher u.s. sanctions against moscow. kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against russia in the indictment against manafort and gates, saying on tuesday that moscow had always said it had never interfered in the u.s. election. that assertion is challenged by u.s. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that moscow did interfere in the november 2016 vote.  ...russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. other countries and other people feature (in the charges),  peskov told a conference call with reporters.  moscow never felt itself guilty so it doesn t feel  exonerated now,  he said, when asked whether the kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the russian foreign ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the trump campaign through a third ex aide, george papadopoulos, who it was announced on monday pleaded guilty in early october to lying to the fbi.  russia s flagship tv news show took a similar line on monday evening, saying it was  now clear that there was nothing  to allegations about manafort being in touch with russian officials to try to sway the election.     the u.s. investigation was an internal matter for the united states, said peskov, but moscow was following it with interest. peskov laughed off the purported role of papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the trump campaign and the russian leadership. in his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, papadopoulos said he had met a london based professor boasting of contacts with russian officials and an unnamed russian woman. he also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the russian foreign ministry. peskov, when asked what the kremlin made of someone linked to the foreign ministry allegedly trying to set up a putin trump meeting, said:  it s an absolutely laughable allegation.  media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is ivan timofeev, who works for a moscow based think tank called the russian international relations council (riac).  timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in august that papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a trump trip to russia. timofeev said papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either riac or the russian foreign ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been  acting on his own initiative  and was  an enthusiast with little experience.  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters on tuesday that there was nothing  illegal  about papadopoulos contacting someone at riac.

" a hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament said on thursday that proposed new u.s. sanctions against the powerful iran backed group aimed to provoke unrest in lebanon. the u.s. house of representatives on wednesday endorsed new sanctions on the shi ite hezbollah militia, part of an effort to increase pressure on iran. the new sanctions have not yet become law.   the sanctions law ... is a blatant interference in lebanese internal affairs, a violation of its national sovereignty and an unacceptable targeting of the lebanese people,  hezbollah parliamentarian hassan fadlallah said in a televised statement.   america aims, through this aggressive behavior in legislation, to subjugate lebanon, to stir unrest and deprive its people of development,  fadlallah said. hezbollah is in lebanon s delicate, national unity government and fights alongside syrian president bashar al assad in syria s more than six year long conflict.  it is classified as a terrorist group by washington and on wednesday the house of representatives passed a resolution urging the european union to do the same.  one of the measures passed by the house of representatives was an amendment strengthening the 2015 u.s. hezbollah international financing prevention act (hifpa) which aimed to sever the group s global funding networks.  when hifpa was introduced it caused alarm in beirut where the government feared major damage to the banking sector that underpins lebanon s economy.  but lebanon s central bank governor riad salameh told reuters on tuesday lebanon had mechanisms already in place to deal with any new sanctions. salameh also said this week the american treasury appeared content with how lebanon was applying sanctions regulations.   they consider the measures which lebanon s central bank has put in place to be sufficient , he said after a visit to the u.s., in a statement distributed by lebanon s presidential media office.

" semi retired wisconsin pig farmer john lader does not think much of donald trump as a messenger, but voted for what he described as the republican president elect’s message of change and economic hope for america. “the last few years, there hasn’t been much optimism and hope among working people in rural areas in this country,” said lader, 65, who lives in the farmland outside the southern wisconsin city of janesville. around 65 miles (105 km) to the northeast in the state’s biggest city of milwaukee, jose boni, who cleans offices at a local university and rents out several homes, heard a different message: trump’s plan to build a wall on the u.s. mexican border and vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the united states illegally, most of whom are hispanic.  “he doesn’t care about our community or working people, he only cares about himself,” said boni, 57, an ecuador born u.s. citizen. the different worlds of lader and boni help illustrate the rural urban divide that was critical to the outcome of tuesday’s u.s. presidential election. a country once defined by regional voting now is more clearly divided by the differences between rural and urban voters. the combination of a strong trump turnout in the countryside and a weak showing by democrat clinton in the cities went a long way toward deciding the election. rural and small town working class white voters, who already tended to vote republican, propelled trump. urban areas, where black and hispanic voters are concentrated along with college educated voters, already leaned toward the democrats, but clinton did not get the turnout from these groups that she needed. for instance, black voters did not show up in the same numbers they did for barack obama, the first black president, in 2008 and 2012. trump beat clinton by 26 percentage points among voters who live in non metropolitan areas, while clinton bested trump by about 7 percentage points in urban areas, according to the nationwide reuters/ipsos national election day poll. steven schier, a political science professor at carleton college in northfield, minnesota, said rural voters “feel they’ve lost something, that america is moving away from them.” “trump came up with the perfect slogan for them in ‘make america great again’ because it hits them exactly where they live,” schier said. democratic presidential candidates had won in wisconsin in every election since 1988, until trump’s victory on tuesday. in wisconsin, overall turnout was lower than in the 2012 presidential election. trump actually was a few hundred votes shy of 2012 republican nominee mitt romney’s total in the state, but clinton was around 240,000 votes short of obama’s 2012 tally. she ended up around 24,000 votes behind trump in the state. “those couple hundred thousand democratic voters for whatever reason decided not to vote,” mordecai lee, a political scientist at the university of wisconsin milwaukee. “they stayed home, and wisconsin went republican. i think that was the pattern around the country.”  turnout in milwaukee’s hispanic neighborhoods was down 9 percent versus 2012, while citywide turnout in milwaukee fell 14 percent.  clinton took 65.6 percent in milwaukee county, which includes the city, to trump’s 28.6 percent. but trump won in rural counties, for example taking 59.9 percent to clinton’s 33.6 percent in fond du lac county in the middle of the state and 71.4 percent to 25.1 percent in florence county in the far north. in milwaukee, election day canvassers found trump’s comments about immigrants were not enough to get people to the polls. christine neumann ortiz, director of community group voces de la frontera, said about 15 percent of the voters reached by the group in milwaukee raised concerns about clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state or were undecided.  “if we reached people, we were able to convince them to vote, but i don’t think we could ever have reached enough by ourselves to overcome trump’s advantage with white working class voters,” neumann ortiz said. the rural landscape was rich trump territory, with people concerned about a slump in commodity prices and layoffs among manufacturers. rural areas, especially in the midwest and northeast, have also seen a demographic shift in recent years with the arrival of hispanic immigrants. demographer william frey of the brookings institution think tank in washington said census data from 2008 to 2015 showed hispanic populations in non metro counties in the midwest rose 18 percent while the white population fell 9 percent.  the counties still are 84 percent white, but those voters are feeling the change, frey said. “they’re a little bit fearful of it, and if they’re being hit hard economically, that can add to it,” frey added. austin arndt, a beef cattle farmer and neighbor of john lader outside janesville, hometown of republican speaker of the u.s. house of representatives paul ryan, said his vote was more against clinton than for trump. he said his vote was based on trump’s promise to cut taxes and repeal obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law, which has enabled millions of previously uninsured americans to gain medical coverage but is detested by conservatives as a government overreach. “from the social point of view as candidates, they were both terrible people,” said arndt, 33. “for me, it was all about the economics.”  ",0
" pope francis condemned on thursday inequality in healthcare, particularly in rich countries, saying governments had a duty to ensure the common good for all its citizens.  increasingly sophisticated and costly treatments are available to ever more limited and privileged segments of the population,  francis said in an address to a conference of european members of the world medical association.  this raises questions about the sustainability of healthcare delivery and about what might be called a systemic tendency toward growing inequality in healthcare,  he said. the tendency was clearly apparent when you compared healthcare cover between countries and continents, the pope said, adding that it was also visible within more wealthy countries,  where access to healthcare risks being more dependent on individuals  economic resources than on their actual need for treatment.  francis did not mention any countries. healthcare is a big issue in the united states, where president donald trump has vowed to get rid of the affordable care act, introduced by his predecessor, barack obama, which aimed to make it easier for lower income households to get health insurance. he said healthcare legislation needed a  broad vision and a comprehensive view of what most effectively promotes the common good in each concrete situation.  in speaking of end of life issues, francis re affirmed the catholic church s long standing teaching that it is morally acceptable for a patient or a family to suspend or reject  disproportionate measures  to keep a terminally ill person alive. but he stressed that this was  different from euthanasia, which is always wrong, in that the intent of euthanasia is to end life and cause death . regarding end of life decisions, the pope said governments had a duty  to protect all those involved, defending the fundamental equality whereby everyone is recognized under law as a human being living with others in society .

" the u.s. senate intelligence committee issued a subpoena on wednesday demanding documents related to russia from president donald trump’s former national security adviser michael flynn, ramping up its monthslong investigation of moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. in a joint statement, senators richard burr, the committee’s republican chairman, and mark warner, its top democrat, said the committee had first requested the documents from flynn in a april 28 letter, but the retired lieutenant general had declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committee’s request. it was the first subpoena announced by the committee in its investigation. warner said on tuesday that the committee has been receiving documents as it investigates allegations that russia sought to influence the u.s. election, something moscow denies. but he told reuters that some people were not complying “so we were going to take next steps.” the trump administration denies any collusion with russia. flynn has been a focus of investigations into russia and the election. he was forced to resign in february as trump’s national security adviser for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergey kislyak, russia’s ambassador to the united states, and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations.  former acting u.s. attorney general sally yates testified at a high profile hearing on monday that she had warned the white house in january that flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by russia. the subpoena was announced a day after trump abruptly fired fbi director james comey, who had been leading the bureau’s investigation of russia and the election. comey’s firing prompted a storm of criticism from democrats, who accused the president of seeking to stall the probe. some of trump’s fellow republicans, including burr, also expressed strong doubts about the timing of trump’s action.

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s transition team has asked two cabinet departments for the names of government officials working on programs to counter violent extremism, according to a document seen by reuters and u.s. officials. the requests to the state department and the department of homeland security involve a set of programs that seek to prevent violence by extremists of any stripe, including recruitment by militant islamist groups within the united states and abroad. reuters could not determine why the trump team asked for these names. the trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. trump has frequently criticized president barack obama for not doing enough to battle islamic militants and for his refusal to use the term “radical islam” to describe islamic state and other militant groups. some career officials said they feared the incoming administration may be looking to undo the work that the obama administration has done on countering violent extremism. “they’re picking a few issues to ask for people’s names,” said one government official who spoke on condition of anonymity, reflecting wider fears that those who worked on such issues could be marginalized by the new administration. earlier this month, trump representatives had asked the u.s. energy department for the names of staffers who worked on climate change policy. the white house expressed concern that it may have been an attempt to target civil servants, including scientists and lawyers. the energy department balked at providing names and a trump spokesman disavowed the request. the state department declined to comment on specific requests from the trump transition team. the department of homeland security did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.     in a dec. 9 email seen by reuters, trump representatives at the state department sought a list of positions in the counterterrorism bureau’s office of countering violent extremism. “please indicate names of people serving in those roles and status (political or career),” the email said, referring to political appointees and career civil servants. three u.s. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a similar request had been made to the department of homeland security (dhs). in that case, the trump transition team asked for the names of members of an interagency task force on countering violent extremism that the obama administration established in january, the officials said. according to a jan. 8 dhs statement, the task force falls under the leadership of dhs and the department of justice, and includes officials from the federal bureau of investigation, the national counterterrorism center and other government agencies. several of trump’s top national security advisers have cast the fight against islamic militants as an existential conflict between civilizations, according to a review of their writings and public remarks. retired lieutenant general michael flynn, trump’s pick for white house national security adviser, said in a post on twitter earlier this year, “fear of muslims is rational.” some counterterrorism experts say that such rhetoric can be used by militant groups to recruit, and will alienate muslim communities whose help is needed to prevent violence. a u.s. official said their guess was that the trump team will likely rebrand obama’s generic fight against violent extremism into a specific battle against islamic radicalization state department spokesman john kirby told reporters on thursday that the department would be cautious about providing names of employees associated with specific issues, but left open the possibility of providing names on an organizational basis. it was unclear whether the state department shared the names of the officials in the office on countering violent extremism or whether homeland security officials provided names. “without getting into the specifics of information either requested by the transition team or provided by the department, i can tell you that ... i know of no requests that have been denied,” a senior state department official said.

" an association of cuban businesswomen has asked to meet with republican senator marco rubio of florida to explain the impact on the country’s nascent private sector of rolling back a detente in u.s. relations. rubio, a cuban american politician who advocates a “no contact” policy with the communist run island, has advised president donald trump on cuba policy and welcomed his reversal of the obama administration’s efforts at a rapprochement. “the current situation has us very worried and we would like to share our personal histories and perspective from cuba,” the association, which represents women who own small businesses, said in a letter to rubio last month. the entrepreneurs took advantage of an economic opening under president raul castro to build businesses, which they said took off as more americans visited cuba from 2015 in the wake of the detente. now, they say those businesses are imploding. they would like rubio, who was born in the united states and has never been to cuba, to visit the caribbean island and witness the impact of u.s. policy. “we want to invite him or part of his team to come and learn about cuba, the cubans here and our businesses,” said niuris higueras, owner of the atelier restaurant in havana, where she said business is down 60 percent from a year ago. the association said rubio’s office had not responded to their letters but they would continue to seek a meeting.  his office did not respond to requests for comment. rubio welcomed trump’s announcement in june that he would reverse former president barack obama’s policies in cuba until democracy was restored but he said this month that new restrictions on business and travel did not go far enough.   the entrepreneurs say they speak for much of cuba’s private sector, which employs 600,000 of the island’s 11 million people.  “we began to have a lot of cancellations after president trump in june made his statement ending obama’s policy,” said nidialys acosta, who runs a business renting vintage u.s. automobiles, nastalgicar. “people said they were scared and uncertain.” julia de la rosa, who runs a 10 room bed and breakfast, said rentals were down 20 percent in october and she expected a further decline as new u.s. regulations on individual travel kick in this month. the new rules limit individual travel, make group visits more onerous and ban americans from doing business with or patronizing 180 cuban military run businesses and their products. “we are not asking for anything. simply that they do not take from us the opportunity to keep working,” de la rosa said.

" war ravaged south sudan is considering scrapping state subsidies on oil because it hasn t been able to pay civil servants for four months and diplomatic staff abroad are being evicted over unpaid rent, the deputy finance minister said.  ending the subsidies would free up desperately needed cash, mou ambrose thiik told reuters in an interview.  nearly four years of civil war have destroyed south sudan s economy. inflation was at 165 percent in august, the 21st consecutive month of triple digit growth. the government depends on oil revenues, but attacks have slashed production to less than a third of pre war levels.  the government expects to receive $820 million from oil this year. out of that, $453 million will go to neighboring sudan as payment for using its infrastructure for export; $183 million on the oil subsidy; and $166 million is allocated to the budget, which has a gaping deficit.   we were thinking that we would lift subsidies on the oil and will be able to cover this (deficit) and pay our salaries more easily,  said thiik.  but we have some resistance from the parliament.  lawmaker nailo mayo, the chair of the finance committee, said parliamentarians just wanted more information on who might be affected by ending the subsidies.   the committee ... is concerned about the social cost, i mean the suffering that could accrue to the poorer section of the community, and also we are afraid of the political cost, that is stability, arising from lack of transport,  he said.  state subsidized oil sells at 22 south sudanese pounds (ssp) per liter, but severe shortages mean many people buy it on the black market for 300 ssp per liter. the ssp trades at about 17.5 to the dollar on the black market and 17.68 at the central bank.  the process for allocating subsidized fuel, which is purchased with government issued coupons, is unclear. south sudan s conflict began in 2013 after president salva kiir, an ethnic dinka, fired his deputy, riek machar, a nuer. the conflict degenerated into ethnic fighting marked by widespread sexual violence.  out of an original population of 12 million, 4 million have fled their homes. more than half of those who remain in south sudan need food aid and nearly three quarters of children are out of school. thiik acknowledged social services were dire and said the finance ministry was trying to save money. it wants to reduce the number of embassies by a third, he said, because it is unable to fund them.   they (embassy staff) didn t get their salary for seven months and also they have arrears in their premises,  he said.  asked about civil servants who had not been paid for four months, he said:  it is true that we have not secured money to pay salaries.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   a fight between the obama administration and north carolina over a state law limiting public bathroom access for transgender people escalated on monday as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach. the u.s. justice department’s complaint asked a federal district court in north carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 civil rights act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. hours earlier, north carolina’s republican governor, pat mccrory, and the state’s secretary of public safety sued the agency in a different federal court in north carolina, accusing it of “baseless and blatant overreach.” the so called bathroom law, passed in march and known as hb 2, prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex. it has thrust north carolina into the center of a national debate over equality and privacy, and has now led the state into what could be a long and costly legal battle with the u.s. government. americans are divided over how public restrooms should be used by transgender people, according to a reuters/ipsos poll, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify.       by passing the law, north carolina became the first state in the country to ban people from using multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms in public buildings and schools that do not match the sex on their birth certificate. u.s. attorney general loretta lynch said on monday the department “retains the option” of curtailing federal funding to north carolina unless it backs down. “none of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not,” lynch said at a news conference, comparing the measure to jim crow era racial discrimination laws and bans on same sex marriage. lynch said the department is monitoring other u.s. jurisdictions that have passed or considered laws similar to north carolina’s but declined to say whether the agency was planning any action against them.      white house spokesman josh earnest called the north carolina law “mean spirited” but mccrory said in his complaint that it is “common sense privacy policy.” north carolina republicans say the law stops men from posing as transgender to gain access to women’s restrooms.     north carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down, according to an analysis by lawyers at the university of california, los angeles law school. the justice department’s complaint named the state of north carolina, mccrory, the state’s department of public safety and the university of north carolina system as defendants. the 17 campus university of north carolina system says it takes federal non discrimination laws very seriously but must also adhere to state laws like hb 2.     “in these circumstances, the university is truly caught in the middle,” unc president margaret spellings said. mccrory told reporters that north carolina had been forced to pass the law after the charlotte city council passed an ordinance that allowed transgender people access to bathrooms based on gender identity in public and private buildings.   “we’re taking the obama admin to court. they’re bypassing congress, attempting to rewrite law & policies for the whole country, not just nc,” mccrory wrote on twitter.   the republican leaders of north carolina’s state legislature also sued the u.s. government over the law on monday, hours after mccrory’s lawsuit. the law is also being challenged in federal district court by critics including the american civil liberties union.

" pope francis, speaking hours before u.s. president donald trump s announcement on jerusalem, called on wednesday for the city s  status quo  to be respected, saying new tension in the middle east would further inflame world conflicts. trump is due on wednesday to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and set in motion the relocation of the u.s. embassy to the ancient city, senior u.s. officials said, a decision that upends decades of u.s. policy and risks fuelling further violence in the middle east. in an appeal at the end of his weekly general audience, francis called for all to honor united nations resolutions on the city, which is sacred to jews, christians and muslims.  i make a heartfelt appeal so that all commit themselves to respecting the status quo of the city, in conformity with the pertinent resolutions of the united nations,  he said. the vatican backs a two state solution to the palestinian israeli conflict, with both sides agreeing on the status of jerusalem as part of the peace process.  palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state, whereas israel has declared the whole city to be its  united and eternal  capital. the pope told thousands of people at his general audience:  i cannot keep quiet about my deep worry about the situation that has been created in the last few days.  he said he hoped  wisdom and prudence prevail, in order to avoid adding new elements of tension to a global panorama that is already convulsed and marked by so many and cruel conflicts.  in 2012, the vatican called for  an internationally guaranteed special statute  for jerusalem, aimed at  safeguarding the freedom of religion and of conscience, the identity and sacred character of jerusalem as a holy city, (and) respect for, and freedom of, access to its holy places.  before making his public comments, francis met privately with a group of palestinians involved in inter religious dialogue with the vatican.  the holy land is for us christians the land par excellence of dialogue between god and mankind,  he said. he spoke of dialogue between religions  and also in civil society .  the primary condition of that dialogue is reciprocal respect and a commitment to strengthening that respect, for the sake of recognizing the rights of all people, wherever they happen to be,  he said to the group. the pope spoke by telephone to palestinian president mahmoud abbas about the crisis on tuesday. the vatican and israel established full diplomatic relations in 1994. francis, former pope benedict and pope john paul ii all visited israel and palestinian territories. when francis visited the holy land in 2014, he flew directly by helicopter from jordan to what the vatican program called  the  state of palestine  and visited israel last. this irked israel because his predecessor had always gone first to israel and entered the territories from israel. the vatican signed its first treaty with the  state of palestine  the following year.

" when senator ted cruz took the stage on tuesday after winning the republican nominating contest in his home state of texas, he issued a call for the party to rally behind his presidential candidacy. that seems a long shot. republican party leaders came away from super tuesday   the 2016 presidential campaign’s biggest day of state by state nominating contests for the nov. 8 election   without any clearer consensus about how to slow front runner donald trump’s march to the nomination. they fear trump’s divisive rhetoric   which includes calls to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar muslims from entering the country   will tarnish the party’s image and ensure democrats hold on to the white house and possibly retake the senate. the billionaire businessman won the largest number of super tuesday contests, taking seven states, but fell short of the 10 states some polls had predicted. cruz won two, and u.s. senator marco rubio of florida notched his first win, in minnesota. that made cruz and rubio unlikely to withdraw from the race before the next big nominating contest in two weeks. the same goes for ohio governor john kasich, who has said he will continue his candidacy through his state’s primary on march 15. “so long as the field remains divided, donald trump’s path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for republicans, for conservatives and for the nation,” cruz said. trump’s failure to win a clean sweep of the primary contests on tuesday buys the establishment wing of the party time to intensify its counterattacks against the new york real estate mogul and political outsider. while they have yet to coalesce around a single strategy, anti trump republicans have begun taking action.   club for growth, a conservative advocacy group, claimed credit for slowing trump in some primary states by running attack ads. “donald trump can be stopped,” said the group’s president, david mcintosh, in a statement. “and he must be, before he costs conservatives the white house, the senate, and the supreme court.” the new york times reported that several financial backers of the republican party organized a phone call on tuesday to get funding for an anti trump effort. helping lead the call were the hedge fund manager paul singer, chicago cubs co owner todd ricketts, and meg whitman, the hewlett packard enterprise chief executive. the newspaper said it was unclear what kind of political offensive might emerge from those discussions. a recently launched political action committee dedicated to blasting trump, our principles pac, said it was ramping up fundraising and planned daily attacks against trump before upcoming primaries in march. it said the campaign would focus on trump’s business record and include a video where he declined in an interview to disavow former ku klux klan official david duke. trump, who later rejected duke’s support, said he had not clearly heard the interviewer’s question. on capitol hill, republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan, who will preside over the party’s nominating convention in july, made clear he disapproved of trump’s rhetoric in comments that suggested he was not ready to welcome trump into the establishment fold. “if a person wants to be the nominee of the republican party, there must be no evasion and no games. they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,” ryan, the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, told reporters. trump ratcheted up the tension during a news conference in palm beach, florida, on tuesday night, warning ryan he would pay “a big price” if he stood in trump’s way.  despite the establishment’s distaste for trump, there appears to be no consensus on the best way to stop him. “as long as both cruz, rubio and kasich remain in the race, then trump will continue to prevail in upcoming primary states and he will vacuum up the delegates while the vote splits among the remaining candidates,” said ron bonjean, a republican operative in washington. rubio and kasich have set their sights on delegate rich contests in the heavily populated states of michigan, florida, ohio and illinois later this month. more than 1,200 delegates are required by the party to secure its nomination.  the goal for the remaining campaigns will be to keep trump from amassing those delegates for as long as possible, with the hope that an increasing tide of criticism from the candidates, party leaders and political action committees will drain his support.  but bonjean said the party would have to find a way to thwart trump before he walked away with the nomination. “the odds of stopping trump are getting much lower with every state put away into his corner,” he said.

" the u.s. secret service will not allow people to carry guns into the july republican national convention in cleveland, quashing the hopes of more than 45,000 people who have signed a petition saying attendees should be allowed to bring firearms. the secret service said on monday it has the authority to preclude guns from sites visited by the people it protects such as u.s. presidential candidates, presidents and former presidents. “only authorized law enforcement personnel working in conjunction with the secret service for a particular event may carry a firearm inside of the protected site,” agency spokesman robert hoback said in a statement. “individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event,” he said. a petition on change.org called for firearms to be allowed into the quicken loans arena during the convention in ohio, a state that allows guns to be carried openly in public. it had drawn 45,811 supporters by monday afternoon. the arena’s rules forbid firearms or other weapons, which the petition says is a “direct affront” to the u.s. constitution’s second amendment right to bear arms. it called  cleveland one of the most dangerous u.s. cities. “with this irresponsible and hypocritical act of selecting a ‘gun free zone’ for the convention, the rnc has placed its members, delegates, candidates and all u.s. citizens in grave danger,” it said. the petition called for five actions to enable gun owners to carry their weapons into the venue. one of those recommendations was for ohio governor john kasich, a republican presidential candidate, to use his executive authority to override the arena’s decision to be a “gun free zone.” but rob nichols, a spokesman for the kasich campaign, said the secret service had made its decision. “at this point the secret service has already weighed in and whoever is the force behind this petition probably should have gone to the secret service from the get go,” he said. the republican convention may be contested if front runner donald trump does not receive enough delegates to clinch his party’s nomination for the nov. 8 presidential election.  trump’s rallies have been punctuated by protesters, and sometimes clashes. he has warned there would be “riots” if he is denied the nomination.

" the vast majority of almost 2 million nigerians driven from their homes by the conflict with boko haram cannot return because of a lack of security, an aid agency said on wednesday. about 1.8 million people have been displaced in nigeria by the conflict with the islamist insurgency, which has left at least 20,000 dead and shows little sign of ending as it drags into its ninth year.     the norwegian refugee council (nrc) said in a report that 86 percent of internally displaced people were not ready to return home in the immediate future. insecurity is cited by 84 percent of them as the main reason for wanting to stay put, it said. only about six in 10 people said they wanted to return to their villages at some point, but could not do so now, the nrc report said. many of the displaced say they have tried to return home, only to be forced to flee back to safer camps and cities because of continued attacks by boko haram and general insecurity.  while the end game is for communities to return home, the unfortunate truth is that pushing people back now will have harmful consequences,  jan egeland, nrc secretary general, said in a statement. although boko haram in recent months has increased its attacks on displaced people, they still feel safer in camps and urban centers than in their communities, said egeland. the nigerian government and military have repeatedly said the insurgency has been  defeated .  despite that, boko haram has killed 381 civilians in nigeria and cameroon since the beginning of april, more than double the amount dead in the preceding five months, amnesty international said last month. the nrc survey did not take into account the roughly 200,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries such as cameroon, chad and niger. the humanitarian crisis in northern nigeria is now one of the biggest in the world, with $1 billion needed to fund relief efforts in 2017, the united nations says.

" president donald trump swore in former goldman sachs banker and hollywood financier steven mnuchin as treasury secretary on monday, putting him to work on tax reform, financial de regulation and economic diplomacy efforts. the u.s. senate voted to confirm mnuchin 53 47, with all but one democrat opposing him over his handling of thousands of foreclosures as head of onewest bank after the 2007 2009 housing collapse. at a white house swearing in ceremony, trump said mnuchin would be a “great champion” for u.s. citizens. “he will fight for middle class tax reductions, financial reforms that open up lending and create millions of new jobs, and fiercely defend the american tax dollar and your financial security,” trump said. “and he will also defend our manufacturing jobs from those who cheat and steal and rob us blind.” lawmakers, lobbyists and business groups have been nervously waiting for mnuchin to take office and fill in the many blanks on how he will pursue tax reform and handle delicate economic cooperation efforts with china, mexico and other trading partners worried that trump’s “america first” strategy will upend decades old trade rules and currency practices. mnuchin, 54, provided no details of his plans as he was sworn in. “i am committed to using the full powers of this office to create more jobs, to combat terrorist activities and financing, and to make america great again,” mnuchin said.     trump has pledged to roll back the stricter financial regulation under the dodd frank reform law enacted after the financial crisis, pursue tougher trade policies on china and mexico to reduce u.s. trade deficits, and reduce business tax rates. mnuchin faces immediate challenges with the march 15 expiration of a u.s. debt ceiling suspension, ushering in the threat of a new default showdown, and a march 17 meeting of finance ministers from the group of 20 major economies, where he will face tough questions about trump’s plans to increase trade protections. in april, mnuchin will have to determine whether to declare china a currency manipulator as part of treasury’s semi annual currency report. “there is a real open question as to whether this administration is going to cut itself off from international monetary cooperation, whether it’s exchange rate policies or attitudes towards multilateral institutions or international regulatory policy,” said edwin truman, a former treasury and federal reserve official now with the peterson institute for international economics among mnuchin’s biggest jobs is managing a sprawling congressional tax reform effort that seeks to slash business tax rates and enact a new border tax adjustment system aimed at boosting u.s. exports. mnuchin will quickly need to build a core management team to handle such challenges. treasury and white house representatives did not respond to requests for comment on monday on reports that trump would soon nominate david malpass, a former economist at failed wall street bank bear stearns, as treasury undersecretary for international affairs, the agency’s top economic diplomacy job. malpass, a trump campaign adviser who had been leading treasury transition efforts, was seen as a leading candidate for the job, with experience from international economic posts in the ronald reagan and george h.w. bush administrations. other names that have been floated for senior posts include goldman sachs banker jim donovan for deputy treasury secretary and justin muzinich, a former morgan stanley banker, for undersecretary of domestic finance. mnuchin, a second generation goldman sachs banker who led the firm’s mortgage bond trading but left the bank in 2002, came under fire from democrats over his investor group’s 2009 acquisition of another failed lender, indymac bank, from the federal deposit insurance corp. the bank, rebranded as onewest, subsequently foreclosed on more than 36,000 homeowners, drawing charges from housing advocates that it was a “foreclosure machine.” mnuchin grew onewest into southern california’s largest lender and sold it for $3.4 billion in 2015. he has also helped finance hollywood blockbusters such as “avatar,” “american sniper” and this past weekend’s box office champion, “the lego batman movie,” which took in $55.6 million. the senate on monday also unanimously confirmed david shulkin as secretary of veterans affairs, putting the only holdover from the obama administration in charge of the second largest federal agency. shulkin had been in charge of the va’s sprawling health system for the past 18 months.

" the leaders of the five emerging market brics powers have for the first time named militant groups based in pakistan as a regional security concern and called for their patrons to be held to account. india welcomed the move   which came at a summit in the chinese city of xiamen   as an important step forward in the fight against militant attacks, of which it has been a target. brazil, russia, india, china and south africa make up the brics grouping. china has generally been supportive of its ally pakistan in the past. the group called for an immediate end to violence in afghanistan.  we, in this regard, express concern on the security situation in the region and violence caused by the taliban, (islamic state)..., al qaeda and its affiliates including eastern turkistan islamic movement, islamic movement of uzbekistan, the haqqani network, lashkar e taiba, jaish e mohammad, ttp and hizb ut tahrir,  the leaders said in the declaration. lashkar e taiba is a militant group based in pakistan which india blames for cross border attacks including the 2008 assault in its financial capital mumbai in which 166 people were killed.  jaish e mohammad, another anti india group based in pakistan, was blamed for a 2001 attack on parliament. india has long demanded that pakistan take action against these groups. islamabad denies any involvement in attacks in india including in the disputed region of kashmir and said it is itself a victim of attacks.  indian foreign ministry official preeti saran told reporters on the sidelines of the summit that wording in the communiqu  was a  very important development  and that there was recognition that the world cannot have double standards when dealing with militant attacks.  you cannot have good and bad terrorists, and it is a collective action. members of the brics countries have themselves been victims of terrorism, and i would say that what has come of today acknowledges the fact that we must work collectively in handling this.  china is a close ally of pakistan and has in the past sprung to its defense, especially when india tried to isolate its arch rival in international fora.  india s local media said naming the pakistan based groups in the brics resolution was an important win for prime minister narendra modi s administration which at last year s summit called pakistan the mother ship of terrorism.  there was no immediate comment from pakistan on the brics resolution. china, though, has repeatedly blocked india s attempt to get the head of jaish e mohammad added to a u.n. blacklist of groups linked to al qaeda.

" republicans in the u.s. congress reached a deal on final tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to president donald trump to sign into law. formal language of the legislation has not been released. the following are known provisions on which house of representatives and senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: corporate tax rate: falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. the house and senate bills, as well as trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to make the tax cut immediate. u.s. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  pass through businesses: creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. the house had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the senate, a 23 percent deduction.  corporate minimum: repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. top individual income tax rate: falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. the house had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. the senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining the seven brackets. permanence: the expectation is individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years. the individual tax rates in the house bill were permanent. the individual tax rates in the senate bill would have expired after 10 years. state and local tax (salt): both the house and senate had proposed scaling back a popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property tax payments and capping it at $10,000. the compromise bill is expected to keep that cap, but also allow for continued deduction of state and local income tax payments. mortgage interest: caps the mortgage interest deduction at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. the house had proposed a $500,000 cap. the senate bill left it at $1 million. estate tax: roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million, but leaves the tax in place, mirroring the senate proposal. the house bill had raised the deduction, but also entirely phased out the tax. obamacare mandate: repeals a federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. the house bill did not repeal the obamacare individual mandate.  anwr drilling: allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge. the provision was sponsored by republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska.

" sudanese president omar al bashir visited the war torn darfur region on tuesday in an effort to show his country is ready to have 20 year old sanctions lifted by the united states just weeks before washington is expected to issue a decision. in july the trump administration postponed for three months the decision to permanently lift sanctions, setting oct. 12 as a deadline for sudan to meet conditions, including resolving conflicts and stepping up its humanitarian efforts.   conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab led government. a joint african union u.n. peacekeeping operation, known as unamid, has been on the ground for the past decade. fighting between the army and rebels in the southern kordofan and blue nile regions also broke out again in 2011, when south sudan declared independence. sudan had announced short term truces in these regions in june and october 2016, after which fighting eased in blue nile and kordofan but carried on in darfur. bashir has extended a ceasefire in response to the u.s. moves.  after security and stability, comes development,  bashir said in a speech. he said darfur s security has begun recovering and insisted that arms will only be in the hands of state forces.  just before leaving office, former u.s. president barack obama temporarily eased penalties against sudan, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing sanctions.  his decision was delayed for six months to allow sudan time to meet the conditions which also included cooperating with the u.s. to fight terrorism and improving its rights record. gabriel belal, the spokesman of the justice and equality movement, one of the main rebel groups in darfur, criticized bashir s two day visit, saying it aimed to give a wrong image to the international community that the war was over.   bashir s visit is not welcomed by the people of darfur because he personally issued direct orders for ethnic cleansing,  belal said.   security, humanitarian and political conditions are tense in darfur and there s no prospect for a political resolution.

" kenya s election commission said on tuesday that different staff will be in charge of the oct. 17 re run of the presidential election, after the country s top court last week nullified the result of the august vote. the supreme court ordered on friday that the vote be re run within 60 days, saying incumbent president uhuru kenyatta s victory by 1.4 million votes was undermined by irregularities in the process. kenyatta was not accused of any wrongdoing. independent electoral and boundaries commission chairman wafula chebukati said in a statement on tuesday that it had appointed for three months a project coordinator and officials to run the information technology, logistics, operations and training as well as the national tallying center during the re run.  the appointment takes immediate effect,  chebukati said. the appointments were announced hours after opposition leader raila odinga said his coalition would not participate in the re run unless some officials were removed and its voting technology audited. chebukati s statement did not mention those who previously held the positions. kenyatta responded to odinga s demands by saying there was nowhere in law that required the electoral body to consult odinga. odinga s conditions for participating in the repeat presidential election included the removal of six officials at the election board. he wants criminal investigations to be opened against them.   you cannot do a mistake twice and expect to get different results,  odinga told reporters.  a number of the officials of the commission should be sent home, some of them should be investigated for the heinous crimes they committed.  the opposition also said it was planning to file dozens of challenges to results from races lower down the ticket, including legislative and local seats contested in the aug. 8 vote.  the supreme court ruling, the first time in africa that a court had overturned the re election of a sitting president, was hailed by odinga s supporters as  historic . analysts have said it is likely to lead to some short term volatility in east africa s biggest economy, but could build confidence in institutions longer term. on monday, the election board said it would hold new elections on oct. 17. but odinga said he wanted elections held on oct. 24 or 31 instead.  odinga s national super alliance said in a letter to the chairman of the election commission that before the new vote is held, it needs to audit the technology used to conduct august s election and give an assurance it will be transparent in its conduct.   there will be no elections on the 17th of october until the conditions that we have spelt out in the statement are met,  odinga said.  kenyatta rebuffed odinga s demands.  there is no legal requirement that raila be consulted. i was neither consulted. kenya doesn t belong to one man,  he said in a statement sent by his office. odinga has lost the last three presidential elections. each time, he has said the vote was rigged against him. a row over a 2007 poll, which odinga challenged after being declared loser, was followed by weeks of ethnic bloodshed that killed more than 1,200 people. the opposition also plans to lodge 62 court cases contesting governorship, lawmaker, and local seats, spokeswoman kathleen openda told reuters.  at least 33 court cases were filed contesting election results before the presidential election was annulled, said andrew limo, spokesman for the election board.  the judiciary said in a statement that by tuesday a total 66 cases had been filed before various courts challenging the outcomes of such seats countrywide. the board received challenges to 189 results in 2013.

" overlooked in all the speculation about running for president, republican paul ryan has quietly laid to rest doubts about his ability as a campaign fundraiser for congressional colleagues. ryan has raised more than $9 million through his “team ryan” network since his first day as speaker of the u.s. house of representatives on oct. 30, 2015, through the end of january 2016, a reuters review of u.s. federal election commission filings showed. that haul helps house republicans and party committees and compares with about $6 million raised by his predecessor john boehner over the same three month period in the 2014 campaign cycle and about $7 million in the 2012 presidential election cycle. ryan has delivered at least $8 million to the national republican congressional committee (nrcc), a party group that backs congressional republicans, again topping boehner in 2014 and 2012, according to fec filings through feb. 29. that has helped put the nrcc in its best cash on hand position ever entering an election year, and placed it $2 million ahead of the rival democratic congressional campaign committee.       “i’ll put it this way, paul ryan is a finance chair’s dream in terms of fund raising,” said representative ann wagner, the nrcc’s finance chairman.      the uncertainty this election year about who will win both parties’ presidential nominations has also helped fundraising for congressional candidates, she said.                 ryan has defied skeptics who doubted last year that he could match boehner on the cash front and still fulfill a pledge to be at home with his family on weekends. in u.s. politics, the ability to fundraise is a key test of potential for higher office, but ryan, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, has consistently denied he is interested in entering the 2016 white house race.     “get my name out of it ... i’m not that person,” ryan said on monday, speaking from israel, where he is on a congressional visit, in an interview with talk radio host hugh hewitt. nonetheless ryan is the center of speculation that he could emerge as a compromise nominee if the party’s presidential nominating convention dissolves in chaos in july. “i’m not running for president ... end of story,” ryan said.     despite his fundraising prowess, there are some signs of trouble ahead for ryan. the mere mention of his name produced boos from supporters of republican presidential front runner donald trump at a recent rally in ryan’s home district. and a wisconsin conservative has announced he will challenge ryan in the republican congressional primary election scheduled for august. on capitol hill, ryan must also preserve a tentative peace he has achieved among warring republican factions in the congress. the first test will be to get congress to pass a budget, and ryan risks infuriating conservatives if he is forced to compromise with democrats to avoid a government shutdown, as critics accused boehner of doing.  “the challenge for ryan is similar to the challenge boehner faced. the republican base, at this point, really doesn’t like its own leadership,” said kyle kondik, a political analyst at the university of virginia center for politics. “so just being speaker may eventually take a toll on ryan’s popularity among republicans,” he said.

" a group of mainly syrian women and children who have been stranded in greece pitched tents opposite parliament in athens on wednesday in a protest against delays in reuniting with relatives in germany. some of the refugees, who say they have been in greece for over a year, said they had begun a hunger strike.  our family ties our stronger than your illegal agreements,  read a banner held up by one woman, referring to deals on refugees between european union nations. greek media have reported that greece and germany informally agreed in may to slow down refugee reunification, stranding families in greece for months after they fled syria s civil war. greece denies this.  what we ve managed to do on family reunification is to have an increase of about 27 percent this year compared with last year, even though we re accused of cutting back family reunification and doing deals to cut back family reunification,  migration minister yannis mouzalas told reporters. mouzalas said greece had assurances from germany that refugees whose applications have been accepted will eventually go to germany even if there are delays. he denied that refugees had to pay for their flights.  applications for asylum, reunification and relocation to other european countries can take months to be processed.  i have not seen my husband, my child, for more than one year and nine months,  said 32 year old syrian dalal rashou, who has five children, one of whom is in germany with her husband.  i miss him and every day i am here in greece i cry. i don t want to stay here, i want to go to my husband  she said. about 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly syrians, afghans and iraqis, have become stranded in greece after border closures in the balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western europe. some 25,000 refugees and migrants have crossed to greece from turkey this year   a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015   but arrivals have picked up in recent months. an average of 214 people arrived each day in september, up from 156 in august, 87 in july and 56 in march, mouzalas said. the rise has stretched greek island camps, which are struggling to cope with numbers two to three times their capacity. most new arrivals are women and children, according to united nations data. mouzalas said the government was in talks with local authorities to move refugees and migrants to local accommodation, including hotels, and it also planned to increase the capacity of some facilities.

" kenyan president uhuru kenyatta snubbed a crisis meeting called by the top election official for thursday, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning for next week s presidential vote re run. the first presidential vote in august, which kenyatta won by 1.4 million votes, was annulled by the supreme court over procedural irregularities.  the re run is set for oct. 26 but opposition leader raila odinga has pulled out, alleging a failure to improve oversight of the election, casting doubt on how the vote will proceed. election board chairman wafula chebukati, in a stark message to political leaders on wednesday, said he could not guarantee a credible vote under present conditions, and demanded kenyatta and odinga meet him for talks. the board, known as the iebc, set the meeting for 1130 gmt in nairobi but then said it had been postponed to an unspecified date and time. chebukati later tweeted that he had met odinga and was  looking forward  to meeting kenyatta, though it was not clear if the president intended to respond to his call. opposition demonstrations, which have led to confrontations between police and protesters, and divisive rhetoric by politicians have stoked uncertainty in kenya, east africa s largest economy and a stable western ally in a chaotic region. speaking at a campaign rally in the western town of saboti late on wednesday, kenyatta said the priority was for kenyans to go to the polls on the set date.  we are not interested in telling the iebc what to do. we want them to prepare so kenyans can vote on the 26th,  he said. however, odinga, whose call for mass protests on election day has sparked fears that the crisis could turn violent, called for serious talks on the impasse after meeting chebukati.  odinga said his withdrawal should force the commission to start a fresh 90 day electoral cycle, including fresh candidate nominations. the election board says the vote will go ahead.  chebukati s call for a meeting with the candidates followed the flight of one iebc commissioner to new york. roselyn akombe said she had fled due to threats and said the planned election would amount to a mockery of democracy. the ruling jubilee party filed a petition in the supreme court on thursday alleging opposition politicians were in contempt of court for obstructing a re run by withdrawing from the race and by ordering supporters to continue protests including during trainings of election staff in western kenya.  the current political climate indeed strikingly resembles the period prior to 2007 2008 post election violence,  said francis ole kaparo, chair of the national cohesion and integration commission, a government body in charge of preventing hate speech. following the disputed 2007 poll, more than 1,200 kenyans were killed.

" five u.s. republican lawmakers raised concerns on thursday with the obama administration about implementation of a law meant to make it harder for people to enter the united states if they have visited certain countries, in a letter seen by reuters. kevin mccarthy, top republican in the house of representatives, and four other house members said in the letter that the department of homeland security is making overly broad exemptions to allow people to skirt the new requirements.  the bill was enacted into law in december following the nov. 13 attacks in paris and the dec. 2 shootings in san bernardino, california. the law was designed to keep people who have traveled to syria, iraq, iran and sudan from coming to the united states except through the normal visa process.  under the existing u.s. visa waiver program, citizens of 38 mainly european countries can travel for up to 90 days to the united states visa free. the new law required that travelers who have been to syria, iraq, iran or sudan since march 1, 2011, must get a visa to come to the united states. several of the islamic state attackers who killed 130 people in france held european passports that would have allowed them to easily enter the united states under the waiver system. according to the letter, the u.s. department of homeland security is making exceptions to the new law for people who visited the four specified countries to do humanitarian work, journalism or for “legitimate business related purposes.” “these exemptions from the travel restrictions were not provided for in the law, are contrary to congressional intent, and are in breach of the agreement we reached with members of your administration,” the letter said.  the lawmakers said the department of homeland security must provide congress with details of every visa waiver for those who have traveled to the listed countries on a monthly basis, including name and nationality of each traveler and the justification for granting the visa waiver.  the letter asked the administration to provide no later than feb. 12 emails and other documents that led them to the decision on making exemptions. “had your administration complied in good faith with the bipartisan agreement we reached, we would not be writing you today,” the letter said.  the letter was signed by kevin mccarthy, michael mccaul, bob goodlatte, edward royce and candice miller.

" poland s ruling law and justice (pis) party said on friday it planned legal changes to enhance democracy ahead of local elections next year but analysts said the measures aimed to boost the party s electoral prospects.     the party came third at the last local election in 2014 and its proposals, to be debated in parliament this month, would smooth a path for candidates supported by parties such as itself and make it harder for independent candidates backed by citizens committees. opinion polls show the nationalist party is supported by 37 percent of the electorate and many voters say its policies fight inequality. the european union, however, says that its policies undermine democracy and the rule of law.   we will introduce two terms for mayors and presidents starting from 2018. (we also plan) to replace majority electoral law with a proportional system,  pis deputy lukasz schreiber told a news briefing. critics say many voters appreciate the pis welfare program and so turn a blind eye to changes it has made to the judiciary and media aimed at cementing its rule. the party wants changes including scrapping single member constituencies in which the candidate with the most votes wins, party representatives told reporters in parliament on friday. pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski says the present system is undemocratic and creates scope for abuses. kaczynski has no formal post in the government but is seen as the ruler of the former communist country of 38 million people. on friday, state television showed a quote from kaczynski from last month in which he said the system of single member constituencies was undemocratic because it led to entrenched local leaders all but certain to win re election.  there are some places in poland where we (pis) received 40 percent of votes (in local elections) but we have nothing or almost nothing. it is undemocratic. it creates a danger of abuses ... and one needs to eliminate this,  he said. local elections are expected in late 2018. many town leaders elected in 2014 had the support of local committees rather than established parties. the leaders are called presidents in cities and mayors in towns. the biggest opposition party civic platform, which is centrist, came second in that election while the pis was third.  initial information suggests that the pis project favors big parties as it scraps single member constituencies. this looks like politicizing the local election,  said anna materska sosnowska, a political analyst at warsaw university. critics say the party has taken control over state companies, institutions, media, and the judiciary in order to strengthen its power and improve party s chances in future elections.

 republican u.s. senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy said on thursday they were working with republican senator ron johnson and members of the house of representatives to add more “flexibility provisions” to a proposed bipartisan bill to stabilize the healthcare insurance market in the short term. they said in a statement these provisions were needed to win support in the house for the stabilization measure introduced by republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving subsidies for two years to help lower income americans obtain medical coverage. president donald trump said last week that he was discontinuing the subsidies.

" most of the u.s. coal industry doubts donald trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt cheap natural gas, a competing fuel.  but a small sub section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal   a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants   is gearing up for a trump inspired boom. that’s because the republican president elect has promised a spending surge for roads, bridges and tunnels after he takes office on jan. 20, a push to upgrade america’s infrastructure with the support of leading democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from american steel mills. prices for met coal, as it is called, have already risen in recent months on lower supply from china. “this is the best news that appalachia as a whole has had in about 10 years,” said jason bostic, a vice president at the west virginia coal association, referring to trump’s infrastructure agenda. “suddenly there’s a little bit of hope here.” corsa coal corp, a producer of met coal based in pennsylvania, was already encouraged by the china driven price spike before trump’s victory. now it believes u.s. politics are going its way too. “the thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending,” said george dethlefsen, corsa’s chief executive. “all those things are very energy  and steel intensive, and that’s good for our business.” the company  plans to boost its production of met coal by 70 percent in 2017 to around 1.2 million short tons. in the meantime, it is putting mines on a six day a week schedule, up from four days, and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift, which it normally reserves for maintenance. arch coal inc, which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants, said it was also optimistic about trump, particularly his promise to roll back regulations. but other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem: plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom. national production figures for met coal are unavailable, since the government does not break the data out. but total u.s. coal production has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, costing the industry thousands of jobs, as low natural gas prices and president barack obama’s emissions and water regulations took their toll. met coal prices, however, reflect the coal sector’s only major sign of life this year. they have risen to above $270 a metric ton this month from lows of $70 a ton in february, driven in part by china reducing its output. corsa and arch are among a very small number of u.s. met coal producers that are publicly traded, with most of the others small and privately owned. alpha natural resources, which emerged from bankruptcy in july, declined to comment.  trump’s transition team is weighing an “infrastructure bank” to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation, a trump adviser said this week. democrats, including senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi, have indicated they hope to work quickly with trump on infrastructure. but whether they will succeed is far from certain, as many republicans oppose spending bills. ramaco, a private company, announced in september it will open two met coal mines in west virginia and virginia next year, thanks to $90 million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward. randy atkins, the chairman and chief executive of ramaco, said adding new mines was possible if trump’s u.s. infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them. banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies   including arch and peabody energy corp   and the weak financial conditions of others, atkins said. jim truman, the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group wood mackenzie, said the specialized workers that would be required, such as underground electricians, could also be hard to find given coal’s downturn since 2008. phil smith, a spokesman for the united mine workers of america, said the other key to the u.s. met coal industry’s outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on american made steel and coal as trump has promised. “if we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal, then it won’t make any difference for american miners,” smith said.

" germany’s largest bank has failed to respond to a request from democrats on a u.s. house of representatives panel for details about u.s. president donald trump’s possible ties to russia, a democratic staffer said on sunday. several democrats on the u.s. house financial services committee sent a letter last month to john cryan, chief executive officer of deutsche bank, seeking details that might show if trump’s loans for his real estate business were backed by the russian government. the letter asked for details of internal reviews of trump’s transactions and gave the prominent german bank until friday to respond. the bank’s response did not address any of the numerous questions posed in the letter and its frankfurt headquarters declined to comment, as it has in the past. “deutsche bank’s outside counsel has confirmed receipt of our may 23, 2017, letter but did not provide substantive responses to our requests,” a democratic member of the staff told reuters in an email on condition of anonymity.  the congressional inquiry is also seeking information about a russian “mirror trading” scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of russia. “congress remains in the dark on whether loans deutsche bank made to president trump were guaranteed by the russian government, or were in any way connected to russia,” the democrats wrote in their request to deutsche bank.  “it is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews,” they said. the democrats cannot compel deutsche bank to hand over the information. the house committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but republican committee members   who make up the majority of the panel   would have to cooperate. no republicans have signed the document request. citing media reports, the democrats had called for the bank to hand over any documents tied to internal reviews of trump’s personal accounts at the bank. they also said the bank should state publicly that it had reviewed both the “mirror trading” scheme and trump’s accounts. mirror trading involved buying stocks, for example, in moscow in rubles, with related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through a bank’s london branch. the house panel request to deutsche bank came as trump was mired in controversy over fbi and congressional probes into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and potential collusion between moscow and the trump campaign.  moscow has denied the allegations, and trump has denied any collusion.

" missouri’s republican governor on wednesday said he will convene a special legislative session next week to consider new abortion regulations and counter a local st. louis law he said made it an “abortion sanctuary city.” the session, set to start on monday, will seek stricter regulations on abortion clinics, including requiring annual inspections and that clinics adopt plans for potential medical complications, governor eric greitens said in a statement. that came in response to a federal judge’s ruling in april that blocked requirements for clinics to meet standards for surgical centers and for doctors to have hospital privileges. greitens said he also wants to target an ordinance approved by st. louis aldermen in february banning employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, according to the st. louis post dispatch newspaper. the missouri legislative session ended in may without approving a proposal to nullify the ordinance, which critics said would force groups that oppose abortion to sanction it and could threaten the work of anti abortion pregnancy resource centers.  the roman catholic archdiocese of st. louis in late may sued to overturn the ordinance. “politicians are trying to make it illegal, for example, for pro life organizations to say that they just want to hire pro life missourians,” greitens said in a statement. allison dreith, executive director of the abortion rights group naral pro choice missouri, denounced the governor’s move. “make no mistake about it. the intent behind the governor’s actions is to shame women for their personal medical decisions and make basic reproductive health care harder to access,” she said in a statement.

" the leader of thailand s military junta said on thursday that yingluck shinawatra, the prime minister he ousted three years ago, was in dubai, where she fled last month to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that lost billions of dollars. prime minister prayuth chan ocha, the army chief who led the coup, said thailand would pursue yingluck through diplomatic channels and police cooperation using interpol. his remarks came a day after the country s top court found yingluck guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced her in absentia to five years in prison.  she is in dubai,  prayuth told reporters, adding that the foreign ministry had been tracking yingluck s movements.  the police will now have to proceed and coordinate with the foreign ministry and interpol.  thaksin s puea thai party did not comment to reuters on prayuth s disclosure. but a source in the united arab emirates said yingluck left dubai for london on sept. 11, without giving further details. the supreme court delayed giving its judgment last month after yingluck failed to show in court and police discovered she had slipped out of the country. the thai authorities had not disclosed yingluck s whereabouts before, though senior party members had told reuters  she had gone to dubai where her brother, former prime minister thaksin shinawatra, who lives in self imposed exile to avoid a 2008 jail sentence for graft, has a home. on thursday, asked by reuters whether yingluck had left dubai for london, thai deputy national police chief srivara ransibrahmanakul declined to comment. photographs posted on the photo sharing app instagram by one of thaksin s daughters show thaksin in london since sept. 15. none of the photos feature yingluck. for more than a decade, thai politics has been dominated by the power struggle between the shinawatras and thailand s establishment, which includes the armed forces and urban middle class. the shinawatras remain popular with rural and poor voters, and the rice subsidy scheme had helped yingluck shore up her support base to get elected in 2011. throughout her trial, yingluck said she was innocent and not responsible for the day to day running of the scheme, arguing that she was a victim of political persecution. the ruling junta has promised to hold an election in 2018, though changes to the constitution have ensured the military holds on to some role governing the country. thai police on thursday raided yingluck s home in eastern bangkok, armed with a search warrant. around a dozen police from the forensics unit entered the large compound carrying gloves and metal boxes, to be met by a lawyer for yingluck and one of her bodyguards.

" with so much riding on american support, afghanistan is waiting anxiously to see if president elect donald trump matches his maverick image and reverses policy or keeps to a path that has cost billions and committed thousands of troops to propping up a fragile ally. much to the private annoyance of officials in kabul, america’s longest war barely featured in the election campaign, but few were expecting the billionaire property developer to beat former secretary of state hillary clinton. “it’s been a complete surprise,” said one senior afghan official closely involved in national security issues. “i think everyone was expecting the opposite result. “it (afghanistan) wasn’t a priority in the campaign, that’s obvious. no one talked about afghanistan at all. at least with mrs. clinton, though, you knew more or less what you were getting.” afghanistan will nonetheless present the incoming trump administration with one of its most intractable foreign policy challenges. the united states has spent some $115 billion in aid for afghanistan, but 15 years after the hardline islamist taliban were toppled after the sept. 11 attacks, a third of the country is out of government control and security forces are struggling. as recently as last week two u.s. service members were killed fighting the taliban near the northern city of kunduz, and expectations that afghan security forces could survive without extensive foreign assistance have proved illusory. faced with a mounting taliban insurgency, obama dropped his original aim of pulling out of afghanistan entirely. in july, he decided to keep 8,400 u.s. troops in afghanistan, shelving earlier plans to bring the numbers down to 5,500 and leaving it to his successor to decide how to move forward. before the election, u.s. officials told partners that afghanistan, whose war ruined economy depends heavily on billions of dollars in foreign aid, will not be neglected by the new administration and that ties will remain strong and close. “you can be assured that afghanistan will remain at the highest levels of our foreign policy agenda,” ambassador michael mckinley told an election day party at the u.s. embassy in kabul, before the final results of the ballot were in. however, trump’s “america first” doctrine has left many wondering if he will be willing to continue spending billions of dollars funding afghanistan, particularly given his declaration that: “we’re getting out of the nation building business”. among afghans who use social media, a sense that the incoming president is opposed to their old enemy pakistan made some hope his election would be good for afghanistan, but there is little to go on for those trying to parse his public remarks. so far, he has shown little interest in afghanistan, although his most recent comments suggested he favored keeping troop numbers at around 5,500, the level they were intended to reach by the end of the year before obama shelved the plan and set the number at 8,400. but in other comments, he has described america’s involvement in afghanistan as “a terrible mistake” and appeared to set conditions on the u.s. commitment to nato, which leads the resolute support advise and assist mission in afghanistan. security officials in kabul say the threat that islamic state militants could build their presence in afghanistan should act as an incentive to keep a u.s. force in place, although they admit they remain in the dark about trump’s intentions. “as trump promised during his campaign that he would eliminate daesh (islamic state), we don’t think he would withdraw american forces from afghanistan as daesh is a new threat for afghanistan and the region,” said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “but we are still in a state of uncertainty and we will wait and see what trump has for afghanistan,” he added. the decision will be vital for a country that is likely to depend on american support for years to come. “the united states will almost certainly continue to be the leading source of both military and civilian reconstruction aid to afghanistan for years to come,” the latest report from the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction, a congressional oversight body, said only last month. in an interview with cnn television last year, trump himself appeared to accept that it was too late to pull u.s. forces out. “and at this point, you probably have to stay because that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave,” he said, in the interview in october, 2015.

" the united states wants to exhaust every diplomatic option on north korea s nuclear and missile programs, and to see loopholes in the north korean sanctions regime closed, u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood said on friday.   sanctions have not had a real opportunity to bite as hard as we would like them to bite, and that comes from the fact that they have not been fully implemented,  wood told a news conference in geneva.  north korea fired a second missile over japan far out into the pacific ocean on friday, south korean and japanese officials said, deepening tension after pyongyang s recent test of its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb. washington has in the past accused china, north korea s main trading partner, of failing to apply enough economic pressure to its neighbor. u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on tuesday that if china failed to implement the latest u.n. sanctions on north korea, he would seek new financial sanctions against beijing. wood, formally u.s. ambassador to the geneva based conference on disarmament, said north korea had exploited  gaping holes  in the sanctions regime to secretly acquire equipment for its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon programs:  we want to close those loopholes.  asked if war or a u.s. military strike was possible, wood said:  we are not taking any options off the table but ... we are pursuing the diplomatic track right now.   that s where we are. we want to exhaust all diplomatic options.   the united states wanted to see north korea further isolated, with more countries breaking off or downgrading relations and cutting off trade. he said china had the same interest as the united states in seeking the denuclearization of the korean peninsula, and had helped to apply pressure on north korea by supporting two u.n. security council resolutions. but he said there was much more that china could do, and suggested that beijing s  unique leverage  was only just coming into play.    we re at a real inflection point with regard to china,  wood said.  in a wide ranging briefing on u.s. disarmament interests, wood also reiterated president donald trump s view that iran was not fulfilling the spirit of the joint comprehensive plan of action, the 2015 deal that allowed iran sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program.    if you look at what iran is doing with regard to ballistic missile activity ... when you look at the support it is giving to the assad regime in syria, to hezbollah, to hamas, their funding and support for the houthi rebels in yemen ... iran is not in any way, we think, fulfilling the aspirations of the jcpoa.  he cited the preface of the jcpoa, which says the signatories anticipate that the agreement will  positively contribute to regional and international peace and security . trump must decide next month whether iran is complying with the deal.

" south pacific island nations are scouring shipping records for vessels with links to north korea after fiji said it had identified 20 falsely flagged ships it suspects the isolated regime is using to evade united nations sanctions. fiji, along with interpol and the singapore based regional shipping regulator tokyo mou, are investigating the vessels for links to north korea, a spokesman for the country s maritime safety authority (msaf) told reuters on friday. interpol and tokyo mou did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their investigations. the 18 members of the pacific islands forum this month agreed to launch an audit of every ship registered in the pacific to search for any links to north korea. new zealand foreign affairs minister gerry brownlee said pacific countries, including his own, were concerned north korea was using falsely flagged cargo ships as one avenue to trade goods in spite of sanctions.  what we do know is that declared north korean gdp (gross domestic product) is not big enough to support the nuclear program that they re running so there has to be significant black market or offbook revenue going into the country,  brownlee told reuters in a phone interview this week. the move came as the un on monday ramped up sanctions on north korea, including tightening up oversight of vessels on the high seas. authorities will now be allowed to check suspected vessels for prohibited cargo with the authority of the flag country.  un sanctions introduced in august banned north korean exports of seafood as part of efforts to curtail the regime s access to foreign funds. north korea had been expected to earn an estimated $295 million from seafood in 2017, one u.n. diplomat said. in fiji s case, the north korean linked ships had adopted the island nation s flag without formally registering, the msaf said. it was not known in what way the possibly more than 20 vessels were linked to north korea or what their suspected activities or locations were. the msaf declined to provide details due to the ongoing investigation. in addition to the fraudulent use of flags, pacific governments were concerned north korean vessels could be quietly registering in nations that allow international ships to use their flags.     if it s not clear why they re on that register, in other words, they re not regular callers into pacific ports, then further investigation is needed to untangle the ship owner,  said brownlee. the review would take place over the next couple of months, brownlee said, and australia and new zealand would provide intelligence to help the small island nations check any north korean connections.

" surveillance cameras peer at residents from every major street corner. informants are everywhere, villagers say. and more than a dozen villagers are languishing in prison or detention. the southern chinese village of wukan was once a symbol of grassroots democracy in china. now, a year after the authorities quelled protests over land grabs and the jailing of a local leader, wukan is locked in a stifling security squeeze. a rare visit to wukan by a reuters team and interviews with half a dozen villagers and sources familiar with the situation revealed that the village and surrounding area remain tightly policed as the government tries to maintain security at all costs. villagers in wukan once warmly welcomed the media, but many are now afraid of speaking for fear of reprisals.  there s nothing left here,  said one young man in wukan who was edgy and wouldn t talk for long.  you know what happened,  he added before moving quickly away.  the sources said that a provincial level  wukan mass working group  had been set up with about 100 full time personnel and charged with ensuring  stability  by marshalling a network of informers, security patrols, surveillance systems and floodlights in the village. in the 1980s, the chinese government began allowing elections in villages nationwide, although democracy activists say the votes for village committees were rarely free from official influence.  but after a series of protests against local officials in wukan in 2011, when government offices were ransacked, authorities eventually backed down, allowing the village to hold open elections that became a beacon for democratic hope in china. but now, wukan, once famous in china as the  democracy village , has succumbed to china s tightening grip over civil society and individual rights, said zhuang liehong, a former wukan protest leader who helped lead an uprising against local authorities in 2011.  what is happening in wukan is what is happening in china,  said zhuang.  it s a dark reflection of china, with no freedom of expression. no individual rights.  there was no immediate response from the guangdong provincial government to faxed questions from reuters seeking comment. under president xi jinping, the government has intensified efforts to deepen the reach of the communist party into all aspects of life in china. critics say it brooks no dissent, and has been cracking down on civil society, which it sees as a challenge to central authority.  when xi took the reins in 2013, repressing boundary pushers in civil society was a cornerstone of his political campaign to consolidate power,  diana fu of the university of toronto and greg distelhorst of the massachusetts institute of technology wrote in an academic paper on  grassroots participation and repression in contemporary china . with china s recent leadership transition further consolidating xi s power, the next five years will likely see a continuation of tough social stability policies that will have an impact on places like wukan, some analysts say.  the party has decided to double down on authoritarianism after the problems they ve faced,  said nicolas bequelin, amnesty international s director for east asia. during the 2011 protests, zhuang helped barricade the coastal hamlet of 15,000 people against battalions of riot police. he spoke by telephone with reuters from new york, where he is now in exile after leaving wukan in 2014. wukan sits in a picturesque region flanked by hills and a deep water harbor, with lush farmland, ponds teeming with fish and shrimp, and the occasional flash of kingfishers.  its troubles began in the 1990s when swathes of farmland began being sold off to property developers by the village leadership in a series of opaque deals. in 2011, these problems came to a head, when many villagers began demanding that the land be returned.   a months long insurrection against local authorities and riot police put a global media spotlight on wukan, leading to a rare populist victory in communist china when the provincial authorities eventually backed down.   the village committee at the center of the land deals was removed and a free election was allowed that saw all seven of the protest leaders voted into public office. this village committee soon came under pressure from allies of the old leadership seeking retribution, they said. over the course of the next few years most of the protest organizers left public office, including their leader, lin zuluan, who was jailed for corruption last summer. the protests last year erupted after villagers demanded lin s release. many villagers say the charges were concocted and that a confession by lin on state television was forced. the protests ran for several months and were quelled by hundreds of riot police firing rubber bullets, hurling tear gas and beating up villagers with batons, victims and witnesses told reuters at the time. last december, the people s court of nearby haifeng town, which oversees wukan, sentenced nine villagers to jail terms ranging from two to nine years for a number of charges including illegal assembly, disrupting traffic and spreading false information, according to a notice on its website. there was no immediate response to a reuters request for comment from the lufeng government, which has jurisdiction over haifeng and wukan.   one villager, zhang bingchai, was jailed for two years for allegedly spreading false information, the court said. two acquaintances who knew him said he had spoken about the situation in wukan, to outsiders on his mobile phone and had posted some images of the crackdown. zhuang said his 67 year old father, zhuang songkun, was jailed for three years on a charge of gathering a crowd to block traffic during the protests. the hard line against the protests reflects the government s desire to ensure stability, said xiong wei, the founder of new enlightenment, a village advocacy organization in beijing who has visited wukan on numerous occasions.    and they ve been very successful,  said xiong.  no one dares raise their head. but the problems haven t been resolved,  he added, referring to the land seizures. beyond a checkpoint manned by paramilitary police with guns, the main road into wukan is now lined with giant billboards and colorful flags projecting a new narrative of stability and peace. propaganda billboards and posters were also displayed around town.  advance solidly to execute the strategy of loving the people,  read one, illustrated with a flock of doves flying over uniformed officers clutching rifles as they look across toward a portrait of mao in beijing s tiananmen square.  police and the people build a harmonious and civilized wukan together,  it read. another sign urged a  new ethos . beneath the surface, however, resentment lingers amongst those who spoke to reuters.  wukan has reached a dead end now,  said one villager.  people won t do anything.  back in new york, zhuang, the exiled former wukan protest leader, said he ll keep speaking out.   he said his mother has been harassed and his house surveilled with cameras. visitors to his house have been questioned and several detained, he said. his assertions could not be independently confirmed. all of the other former wukan protest leaders have since quit their posts, been jailed, or harassed, he said.  besides me, there are no voices left. it is silent now.

" u.s. president donald trump will strike a blow against the 2015 iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal in a major reversal of u.s. policy. trump’s decision will not withdraw the united states from the agreement, which was negotiated by washington and other world powers during the administration of former president barack obama. the move likely gives u.s. lawmakers 60 days to decide whether to bring back sanctions on iran that were lifted under the deal.   if congress reimposes the sanctions, the united states would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. if lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. here is a look at where key u.s. lawmakers stand on the deal:  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell: like every republican in congress, mcconnell voted against the iran nuclear agreement. he has not expressed a position on how he will respond to trump’s decertification, but has not yet broken from trump on policy matters. house of representatives speaker paul ryan: has not said where he stands. “i don’t want to get ahead of the president,” he said last week. house majority leader kevin mccarthy: has not said what he would do. senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker: repeatedly spoke out against the agreement and wrote legislation that gave congress some say over it. while he has questioned trump recently on some foreign policy issues   helping spark a twitter feud   corker has followed the administration line on most policy matters. corker said on friday he expected to introduce legislation to “address flaws” in the pact without violating it.  house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce: royce says “as flawed as the deal is, i believe we must now enforce the hell out of it.” it was not clear how he would respond to the legislation.  senate minority leader chuck schumer: opposed the deal two years ago but more recently says it should be left in place but strongly enforced with efforts to clamp down on other activities like iran’s ballistic missile program. house minority leader nancy pelosi: supported the original deal, still supports it. senate foreign relations committee top democrat ben cardin: opposed the deal two years ago, but says u.s. should honor it now, while strictly enforcing it and clamping down on other iranian activities detrimental to the interests of the united states and its allies. house foreign affairs top democrat elliot engel: opposed the deal two years ago but said killing it now would be a “grave mistake.” still an iran hawk on issues such as tehran’s ballistic missile program, human rights violations and its support for what washington sees as terrorism.

" passengers from six mainly muslim countries who would have been barred from the united states under president donald trump’s latest travel order will be allowed to board u.s. bound flights on emirates and etihad airways now that a federal judge has blocked it, the middle east carriers said on thursday. the executive order banning refugees and nationals of six muslim majority countries from traveling to the u.s. was temporarily halted on wednesday, hours before it was to go into effect, by a federal judge in hawaii. emirates will follow guidance by u.s. customs and border protection, issued after the court’s decision, that citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen would be accepted for travel to the u.s. if they possessed the necessary travel documents, an airline spokeswoman said by email. etihad airways “will continue to accept guests of all nationalities for travel to the u.s. provided they have valid travel documents and, if necessary, visas,” an airline spokeswoman said.  the abu dhabi based carrier said it would continue to assist passengers affected by the recent executive orders but was advising them to check with their nearest u.s. mission as “u.s. travel requirements are subject to change.” the wednesday court ruling is only temporary, until broader arguments in the case can be heard. trump said it made the united states look weak, and promised to take the case “as far as it needs to go. a notice on qatar airways’ website said passengers would still need to have valid travel documents after the executive order was “enjoined.” the revised order, which was less restrictive and removed iraq from trump’s original list, was organized in coordination with airlines, industry group iata has said, unlike the initial ban which came into immediate effect without notice.  trump signed the new ban on march 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with the first order in january, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a washington judge stopped its enforcement in february.

" silvio berlusconi need no longer pay his ex wife 1.4 million euros ($1.7 million) a month, an italian court said on thursday, ruling the former prime minister had been unfairly treated in a divorce settlement. the milan appeals court also told veronica lario, a former actress, to hand back to berlusconi alimony payments totaling some 60 million euros, saying she had no right to the money. the good news for the tycoon politician comes as his political career   considered dead and buried only a year ago   is also back on the rise. the milan case follows a landmark ruling by italy s top appeals court in may that said divorce settlements need not guarantee spouses their previous standard of living but rather ensure they were financially independent. berlusconi, italy s seventh richest man, according to forbes, with a wealth estimated at about 7 billion euros, was married to lario for more than 22 years.  they split in 2009, with the normally reserved lario writing to italy s national news agency to denounce her husband s interest in other women. their divorce was formalized in 2014. following their separation, berlusconi was embroiled in scandals over his  bunga bunga  parties and convicted of paying to have sex with a 17 year old minor. the verdict was later overturned when an appeals court said it could not be proved he knew she was underage. berlusconi s partner of the last five years is francesca pascale, a former television show girl 49 years his junior. a court in 2012 initially awarded lario alimony of three million euros a month. this was subsequently cut to 1.4 million, but berlusconi complained it was still too high. a legal source said the milan judges took into consideration the may supreme court ruling and decided that lario, who has cash deposits of some 16 million euros as well as jewels and a real estate business, did not need additional monthly income. there was no immediate comment from lario or her lawyers.

" the freeing of a hostage u.s. canadian family by pakistan s army has been hailed by officials as a positive step in mending ties between washington and islamabad, but those hoping for a fresh start in their fraught relationship seem likely to be disappointed. pakistan and the united states have for years been   at  best   uneasy allies in the war against the taliban and other islamist extremists. u.s. president donald trump said the raid that rescued american caitlan coleman, her canadian husband joshua boyle  and their three young children showed that pakistan had started to  respect the united states again  in response to his administration s tough talking tactics. but the two countries still have conflicting interests   and the trump administration s vow to apply more diplomatic pressure on pakistan is unlikely to work, given islamabad s growing alliance with regional heavyweight china, say analysts.  this is a small occurrence between pakistan and the u.s., and it should not be confused with the big issues that separate pakistan and the u.s.,  said pakistani security analyst imtiaz gul. on friday, five years after they were kidnapped in afghanistan, coleman and boyle flew home with the three children born while they were captives of the haqqani network, a feared taliban sub group that washington particularly accuses pakistan of failing to do enough to fight. some saw the timing as a goodwill gesture ahead of upcoming visits by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and defense secretary jim mattis.  i don t think it s a coincidence that this hostage release was announced when you have a parade of top trump administration officials in islamabad to deliver strongly worded warnings to pakistan,  said michael kugelman, a south asia specialist at the woodrow wilson center.  he added that no one should take the good news as a definite sign that pakistan would drastically change its behavior towards militants such at the haqqanis.  going after hostages is not the same thing as going after the terrorists holding them,  he said. the united states has repeatedly accused pakistan of not doing enough to eliminate militant havens on its territory. for now, officials on both sides are talking up the cooperation on display in wednesday s rescue operation, when pakistani troops acting on a u.s. intelligence tip off swooped on a vehicle carrying the hostages. but tensions remain. pakistan is still angry at the unilateral u.s. operations on its soil to kill al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2011 and last year s drone strike that killed taliban supreme leader akhtar mansour. united states officials, for their part, suspect both bin laden and mansour were able to live in pakistan with the tacit support of at least some elements of the powerful military. washington also argues that the taliban   which has been fighting to re establish its hardline islamist regime in kabul since a 2001 u.s. backed military intervention   would not have been able to gain so much ground against afghan government forces in recent years without safe havens in pakistan. trump s administration in august warned aid to pakistan might be cut and washington might downgrade its status as a major non nato ally, in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to america s longest running war. pakistani officials bristle at u.s. claims islamabad is not doing enough to tackle islamist militants, particularly the haqqanis, saying they have cooperated for years and launched military operations to push out militants from its soil. pakistan also says few appreciate that 17,000 pakistanis have died fighting militants or in bombings and other attacks since 2001. pakistan is less vulnerable to threats of u.s. aid cuts because islamabad has been deepening its relationship in recent years with china, which is financing some $57 billion in infrastructure projects, said gul. critics say the pakistani military nurtures the taliban and other islamist factions because they are seen as potentially useful to pakistan s core confrontation with old rival india. the trump administration s recent talk of a  regional strategy  for afghanistan that would include a bigger role for india has deeply upset pakistan s establishment, said mosharraf zaidi, an islamabad based commentator and former pakistan foreign ministry adviser.  it seems like for the u.s., and president trump has said so, that india is going to be a big part of the future of afghanistan, and for pakistan that s not on the table,  zaidi said. as a nuclear power, pakistan could also be offended further at trump s implication that it has bowed to his administration s pressure.  given that people understand that respect for america is a big deal for trump and a big deal for the american people, it shouldn t be so hard to understand why pakistan ... also wants to be respected,  said zaidi.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on tuesday: trump will seek to convince americans of his ability to run the country and negotiate with congress on tuesday in a nationally televised speech that offers a chance to move past his tumultuous first weeks in office. the white house and congress lack agreement on a plan to repeal and replace obamacare amid signs of growing republican division on the issue, as trump prepares to address lawmakers about his 2017 agenda. trump is considering introducing legislation to provide illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status   but not immediately to citizenship, cnn reported. trump says “maybe it’s my fault” that his immigration policy was not communicated effectively, but gives himself a grade of a for “what i’ve actually done.” trump’s nominee to be director of national intelligence pledges to back a thorough investigation of any russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, seeking to reassure lawmakers worried that partisan politics might interfere with a probe. the national security agency risks a brain drain of hackers and cyber spies because of a tumultuous reorganization and worries about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and trump, according to current and former nsa officials and cyber security industry sources. the white house denies that trump plans to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the u.s. renewable fuels association said the president’s team had informed the group an order was pending. trump’s attorney general, jeff sessions, says the federal government should stop suing local police departments, signaling a sharp departure from the obama administration’s policy toward law enforcement exhibiting patterns of racism or excessive force. trump’s proposal to slash funding for the state department and foreign aid faces stiff opposition in congress, not just from democrats, but also from many fellow republicans. major u.s. corporations are going to war in washington over a republican “border adjustment” tax proposal meant to boost exports over imports, with lawmakers coming under pressure from some of the nation’s biggest employers. trump signs an order directing regulators to review an obama administration rule that expanded the number of federally protected waterways as he targets environmental regulations conservatives label as government overreach. trump signs an executive order aimed at boosting government support for historically black colleges.

" the white house said on thursday that the best way for the government to fight tax avoidance would be for congress to take action after the u.s. treasury department issued major new rules on tax inversions on monday. “i know that if they are working on any future actions the most impactful thing we could do is if congress took some action here,” white house spokesman eric schultz told reporters when asked if the treasury department would issue more regulations on tax avoidance.  u.s. drug maker pfizer inc agreed on tuesday to terminate its $160 billion agreement to acquire allergan plc in a victory for the obama administration’s push to stop tax dodging mergers.

" a u.s. district judge in austin has rejected an effort by texas to have a law that would punish so called sanctuary cities be declared constitutional ahead of the measure taking effect next month. the republican backed law is the first of its kind since republican donald trump became president in january, promising a crackdown on illegal immigrants and localities that protect them. texas is the u.s. state with the longest border with mexico.  u.s. district judge sam sparks, appointed under republican president george h.w. bush, dismissed the case without prejudice late on wednesday. the brief ruling did not give a reason. senate bill 4 calls for jailing police chiefs, sheriffs and possibly frontline officers who fail to cooperate with u.s. immigration officials. the measure also allows police to ask about immigration status during a lawful detention. after the law was approved in may, texas sued major urban areas, including austin, el paso and houston, as well as civil rights groups, saying they backed policies of non cooperation with federal immigration officials. at a june hearing, sparks asked why a court should declare the law constitutional before it took effect on sept. 1. he also questioned why he should hear the case when most of the parties were part of a separate lawsuit over the same law being heard in a federal court in san antonio. the defendants contended they had abided by federal law and the suit should be dismissed because texas had no evidence showing it had been harmed by a law not yet in effect. republican texas attorney general ken paxton said on wednesday he was disappointed with the ruling on what he called an “undoubtedly constitutional law.” the american civil liberties union, a civil rights group that has argued in court against the law, on thursday said the texas suit was a farce aimed at distracting attention from the harm that would come with sb 4. “this is a significant blow to the state, and its legal posturing has only resulted in wasted taxpayer money,” edgar saldivar, senior staff attorney of the aclu of texas, said in a statement.   in the federal case in san antonio, a small border town and some of the largest texas cities told a judge in june that sb 4 could lead to an immigration police state and establish illegal racial profiling. they asked the court to halt it, saying it was unconstitutional.

" the trump administration is considering taking steps to broaden the obamacare limits on claiming a religious or moral exemption from providing health insurance that covers birth control, vox news reported on wednesday. the vox website posted a copy of a draft of a new rule that it said the administration was reviewing. the rule would undermine coverage for one of the 10 essential health benefits covered by president barack obama’s signature piece of domestic legislation, which republicans have vowed to repeal and replace. the u.s. department of health and human services declined to comment and spokeswoman alleigh marre said it does not “comment on alleged drafts of documents.” the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. under the 2010 affordable care act, often called obamacare, employers are required to provide health insurance that covers birth control, except for religious houses of worship, which are exempt. some owners of private businesses also obtained exemptions after the supreme court ruled in 2014 that they could object to the rule on religious grounds. republicans do not have enough seats in the u.s. senate to fully repeal obamacare and as a result, the republican strategy for rolling back the law includes stopping implementation of new health regulations and creating new administrative rules that undermine parts of the existing law. planned parenthood, the american civil liberties union and other healthcare groups criticized the proposed rule and said it would make it harder for millions of americans to access the healthcare they need. the aclu threatened to challenge the administration in court if the rule becomes finalized.  “any rule that allows employers to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees is an attempt at allowing religion to be used as a license to discriminate,” the aclu said in a statement.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry met on tuesday with about 10 of the 51 state department officials who last week wrote a cable disagreeing with u.s. policy toward syria and arguing for “a more militarily assertive u.s. role.” multiple u.s. officials have said they do not expect the memo, conveyed through the state department’s relatively rarely used “dissent channel,” a conduit for voicing contrary views, to change u.s. president barack obama’s policy. in the cable, the diplomats call for military strikes against president bashar al assad’s government to stop its persistent violations of a civil war ceasefire obama’s policy toward syria, where a civil war has burned for more than five years, has been predicated on the goal of avoiding deeper military entanglements in the middle east, and has been widely criticized as hesitant and risk averse. obama’s limited intervention has focused on fighting the islamic state militant group that controls a swathe of syria and iraq and that has inspired attacks on u.s. soil. the memo by the state department officials demanded a more muscular stance. while state department spokesman john kirby said that kerry had met with about 10 of the officials for half an hour on tuesday, he declined to provide details of their discussion about the cable, which the department has not made public. “we believe that achieving our objectives will continue to elude us if we do not include the use of military force as an option to enforce the cessation of hostilities (coh) and compel the syrian regime to abide by its terms as well as to negotiate a political solution in good faith,” said a draft of the memo posted online by the new york times.

" two years ago there were questions over whether indian prime minister narendra modi could get a visa to enter the united states. next week he visits washington as one of president barack obama’s closest international partners. obama invited modi for one of the last big visits by a world leader before his term ends in january. although the trip won’t feature a lavish state dinner, the indian leader will address both houses of congress, considered a rare honor. this will be their seventh meeting since modi became prime minister in may 2014, an impressive tally for a u.s. president and a leader who is not a formal ally, said ashley tellis at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington. “the personal relationship between the president and the prime minister ... is really one of the unanticipated surprises of the past two years,” said tellis, an expert on india. the developing relationship is seen as an obama foreign policy success. washington views india as an important part of its rebalance to asia and as a counterweight to china.     the two countries are finalizing agreements that would make it possible for their militaries to cooperate more closely, and for u.s. defense manufacturers to both sell and make high tech weaponry in india. a deal on logistics would govern issues such as how the two countries account for costs of military exercises. another involves encrypted communications and geospatial data transfer. a history of colonial rule followed by decades of non alignment has, however, made new delhi wary of an embrace by the more powerful united states, which has overtaken russia as india’s top arms supplier. “it is neither a strategic partnership nor an alliance,” said nitin gokhale, founder of defense portal bharat shakti. “it can be a long term arrangement, but to call it a strategic partnership would be premature.”     there are frustrations, too, on the u.s. side. the two countries reached a civil nuclear agreement in 2005, but it has yet to yield any contracts for u.s. based companies. only now is westinghouse, a unit of japan’s toshiba, approaching the finish line on a deal to build six reactors in india. the visit gives modi a chance to network with u.s. lawmakers who may feature in a donald trump or hillary clinton administration but, as it coincides with the california primary, he is not expected to meet either. modi is generally popular with u.s. lawmakers, who extended his invitation to address congress. but they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to u.s. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, and question new delhi’s record on human rights. “the economic engagement between our two countries should increase and it should be more accessible for u.s. companies,” senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said in a telephone interview.  obama and modi are expected to discuss india’s desire to join the nuclear suppliers group (nsg), a 48 member club of nuclear trading nations. india was shut out for decades because of its weapons program, and the civil nuclear agreement with the united states gave it access to foreign suppliers without giving up its arms. obama administration officials have said they backed india’s desire to join the group, but the idea faces resistance among some on capitol hill, as well as from china, an ally of india’s arch rival pakistan. “existing nsg guidelines were established to guard against nuclear proliferation, and we should not create exceptions for particular countries,” corker said. there is lingering concern in washington over modi’s handling of communal riots in 2002 that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly muslims, in gujarat. modi was chief minister of the state at the time and, though a court ordered inquiry found insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the issue prevented him from getting a u.s. visa for years. ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, raised human rights on a visit to new delhi this week, saying the two largest democracies had “special obligations” to set the highest standards. congress’ tom lantos human rights commission has scheduled a hearing on india for june 7, the day modi arrives in washington and the day before his address to the combined house of representatives and senate. he leaves the united states on june 8. corker promised to asked modi about india’s record on human trafficking, which he brought up recently in an emotional senate hearing with obama administration officials. “the country we believe has 12 14 million slaves, which is close to half the number we believe exists worldwide,” corker said. “it’s obviously a very significant issue and when he’s here, it’s one i certainly plan to raise.” ",0
" an aardvark was killed and four meerkats are missing believed dead after a blaze tore through part of london zoo early on saturday, destroying a cafe and gift shop. the fire broke out shortly after 0600 gmt at the zoo s animal adventure section before spreading to the shop and cafe, near to an area where visitors can handle and feed animals, the zoo and london fire brigade said. more than 70 firefighters took three hours to bring the fire under control while desperate keepers who live on the site in regent s park in central london moved animals to safety. some of the staff needed treatment for smoke inhalation and shock. ten year old misha the aardvark, one of the zoo s best loved animals, perished in the fire and four of the meerkats were unaccounted for and are also presumed to have died. taking their name from the afrikaans word for  earth pig , aardvarks are large burrowing mammals found across much of africa.  we re absolutely devastated that misha the aardvark has been killed and we re still trying to find out what happened to the meerkats, but at the moment the site where this fire took place is closed down,  dominic jermey, the zoo s director general, told bbc tv.   at the moment we re not certain what has happened to the meerkats but i m not optimistic at this stage, unfortunately.  other animals nearby are being monitored by vets, but the zoo said indications were that they were unaffected. it said it hoped to reopen on sunday. it is the world s oldest scientific zoo, dating from 1826, and houses 20,166 animals, according to its inventory for 2017.  the fire brigade said it had sent 10 fire engines and 72 firefighters to the scene and added that the cause of the blaze was under investigation.  the fire mainly involved the cafe and shop but part of a nearby animal petting area was also affected,  said station manager david george.   when they arrived our crews were faced with a very well developed fire. they worked incredibly hard in arduous conditions to bring it under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighboring animal enclosures.

" an emissary of an independence movement in the western sahara has spent two weeks in lima airport and refuses to leave, after she was denied entry to peru for alleged political activities on a prior visit, peru s foreign ministry said on wednesday. jadiyetu el mohtar is a spanish citizen who describes herself as the ambassador to peru for a disputed area in the western sahara known as the sahrawi arab democratic republic (sadr). peru is one of a few dozen countries that has recognized the self declared sadr, which the polisario independence movement claims is a separate state from morocco. sadr is not recognized as a state by the united nations and peru suspended diplomatic ties with sadr in 1996.   el mohtar had hoped to help reestablish those ties, she told reuters by phone from the international arrivals area of lima s airport. she said she was awaiting an appeal to the decision to block her entry. peru said el mohtar had violated the terms of a tourist visa by taking part in political activities during a previous visit. it has refused to grant her another visa and urged her to comply with an order to fly back to spain. el mohtar has denied any wrongdoing and said her stay in peru in july and august included meetings with environmentalists and feminists and did not violate migratory laws.  i am sleeping on an inflatable mattress,  el mohtar said.  i have come to work to pave the way for re establishing diplomatic relations with peru.  peru s foreign affairs ministry said it was not considering reestablishing diplomatic ties with sadr and does not recognize polisario representatives as diplomats. el mohtar said she has visited colombia, ecuador and cuba without any problem. earlier this year, peru banned a canadian activist and a u.s. journalist from peru after they screened a film critical of a mining company in an andean region while on tourist visas. in april, the u.n. security council unanimously backed attempts to restart talks between morocco and polisario over the western sahara conflict, and extended its peacekeeping mission there for another year.

" an indian court on monday remanded in custody a french journalist for five days after he was arrested in the disputed kashmir region for filming a documentary without permission and violating visa regulations, police said. the freelance journalist, paul comiti, was arrested on sunday in srinagar, the main city in indian administered kashmir where muslim separatists have been waging a violent campaign against  indian rule since the late 1980s. comiti held an indian business visa which did not permit him to make a documentary on political or security related issues, senior superintendent of police imtiyaz ismael parray told reuters. comiti had met a separatist leader, mirwaiz umar farooq, and filmed protesters throwing stones at members of the security forces, said another senior police official, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media. he had also met victims of anti riot  pellet guns  that the  security forces use against protesters. more than 3,800 people have been wounded and one killed by the weapons since a new round of protests against indian rule erupted last year, with more than 100 partially or fully blinded, official figures show.  we called him to ask him about his activities, but he refused to present himself before the police,  the second police official said.  he was not authorized to film here because he was on a business visa. he was finally arrested.  muslim majority kashmir is claimed in full but ruled in part by mostly hindu india and muslim pakistan and has been at the heart of nearly seven decades of hostility between the neighbors. comiti had asked the defense ministry for permission to  film in kashmir, but it had been denied because he was on a business visa, said the second police official. a french embassy s consular official based in new delhi met comiti at the police station in srinagar, police said. an embassy spokesman was not available for comment. an insurgency by separatist militants raged in kashmir through the 1990s and into the 2000s but it had died down more recently. but the killing by the security forces of a young, popular separatist leader in july 2016 sparked a new wave of protests by a new generation in india s only muslim majority state. india s interior minister said last year the government planned to reconsider the use of the pellet guns to control crowds, after the multiple casualties stirred public anger and condemnation by rights groups.

" yesenia vergara grabbed her two daughters and abandoned her home in the isolated mexican hamlet of huautla late last month when rain swollen river waters burst through her window, flooding her house with branches, boulders and mud. just two weeks later, mexico s deadliest earthquake in a generation delivered a second blow to her simple riverside home, financed with money sent back by her husband from the united states.  this is the end of the world, i thought. now is the time that god has called us to be judged,  vergara said, recalling the moment when the quake struck in the early afternoon last tuesday.  the village was just getting back on its feet and now another tragedy has come,  she said. the epicenter of the 7.1 magnitude tremor, which has claimed nearly 300 lives so far, leveled dozens of buildings in mexico city, sparking a desperate search for survivors. the quake struck 70 km (45 miles) from huautla, a charming settlement nestled amid the lime green mountains of morelos state.     while the mexican capital has been over run with eager volunteers amid an outpouring of support, the villages of morelos and puebla states that lie near the epicenter have received much less attention.     a growing cadre of well wishers sought to rectify that on friday, fanning out across the states  backroads, trudging through knee high streams to deliver food, water and medicine to remote populations high up in the mountains.     far outpacing the government response, the volunteers  patriotic reaction has cheered a traumatized country. it has also provided a sharp contrast to the increasingly politicized reaction to the tremor, which sparked a virtual arms race between political parties seeking to outdo each other with donations to relief efforts.      we feel very grateful,  vergara said of the volunteers.  but also very disappointed with the government.  although the quake didn t destroy any buildings in huautla, mayor miguel medina said 10 families out of roughly 1,000 people were evacuated because some 100 structures were damaged.     by friday afternoon, vergara said nobody had yet come to inspect the thick cracks menacing her home, exiling her and her young family to her mother s house.     fortino garcia, a 48 year old taxi driver from the city of cuernavaca, was among eight people who had driven from mexico city to deliver aid to villages in the area.     although he approved of the government s reaction to the quake, he criticized politicians who he said were trying to capitalize on the tragedy by placing stickers with their name or party on supplies collected by volunteers.      lots of politicians are sadly jumping on this to campaign,  he said in huautla s main square, after delivering diapers, sanitary towels and water.     a growing resentment over how the aid was being distributed by village officials was on display as residents accused officials of cherry picking better quality donations of clothes and food and leaving less desirable ones for the villagers.     in a warehouse in the center of the village where hundreds of women were lining up for food and water, medina denied he or any of his employees had been profiting from the aid, which he said came from all over the world.      people from other countries have come to give us their little grain of sand,  he said.  we re very surprised and thankful.      still, rumors of official malfeasance could be found on every corner.     like much of mexico, crime and violence in huautla had risen dramatically over the last few years, according to a shopkeeper who declined to give her name out of fear. she said some villagers took up arms last month and installed themselves at the entrance to the town to ward off outsiders.     in july, she said, an elderly woman was killed when she interrupted a burglary in her home, something previously unheard of in this quiet farming settlement.      given the impact of the flood, the quake and rising violence, she said she was less optimistic for the future of her teenage daughter, who was listening by her side.      we re scared,  the shopkeeper said.  things aren t like they used to be.

" walt disney co (dis.n) chief executive bob iger on wednesday defended his seat on president trump’s business advisory council as an opportunity to voice opinions that will benefit the company and its shareholders. facing questions regarding his inclusion on the council at the disney’s annual shareholders meeting, the chief executive said he had no plans to step down from the group, as some critics have urged him to do. in response to one question, iger said he did not believe his membership “supports or endorses” trump’s policies. another speaker, who identified himself as a member of the colorado people’s alliance, said iger’s decision to remain on the council suggests disney “is tacitly endorsing trump’s agenda.”  iger, however, referenced a song from the broadway musical “hamilton” called “the room where it happens,” saying it was important to have input in a forum where policies are being shaped. “i think there is an opportunity, when you are in the room where it happens, to express opinions i believe would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,” he said at meeting held in denver. iger said he would at times express views “likely to be adversarial” to the president.  uber technologies inc uber.ul chief executive officer travis kalanick quit trump’s advisory group in february amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies. iger said immigration had helped disney in many ways, citing the issue as an example of something he could address on the trump advisory council.  the united states and disney have “benefited from an open and fair immigration policy,” iger said. “i don’t happen to believe policies that single people out by religion are fair and just.” iger skipped the first meeting of trump’s advisory council in february to attend a previously scheduled board meeting. he fielded several questions on political topics at the meeting with another speaker suggesting that disney owned abc news holds a liberal political bias, a charge iger vigorously rejected. “they work very, very hard to present news in a fair way,” iger said, adding that he did not agree the media was “an enemy of the people,” as trump has written on twitter. iger said there were times the obama administration disliked coverage by abc news. “i am proud of the fact news can be an adversary,” iger said.

" chinese president xi jinping spoke to the country on wednesday about  waves of positive energy  from the ruling communist party after its twice a decade leadership shuffle, but on the rural outskirts of shanghai, not everyone was riveted to the screen. as the party congress drew to a close and xi prepared to unveil a new leadership team during the national broadcast, some elderly residents gathering for lunch in the sleepy suburb of fengxian expressed indifference. an 85 year old man with a shock of white hair, who identified himself by the surname cai, said he would not watch.   whatever happens today, i don t care,  he said with a smile.   i m a christian and i go to worship after lunch, and i will be late if i watch. i am not cultured. i don t understand what they are saying.            gathering in a crowded two storey compound with dusty concrete floors and solid wooden furniture heaving with fruit and snacks, fei jinxian, another 85 year old fengxian resident, said she was unclear of the significance of wednesday s events. watching the broadcast, fei and her friends nodded appreciatively when xi emerged on to the stage, but she said she barely recognized any of the other figures appointed to the politburo standing committee, including premier li keqiang.  i recognize xi jinping, and i recognize han zheng because he is from our city, but the others i don t know about,  fei said in the local dialect. as a chinese television commentator reflected on the  historical importance of this moment , 58 year old gu wenfeng said she did not understand.   i don t normally pay much attention to politics,  she said.    i only watch it if my son is around and he puts it on.  xi has emerged as china s most powerful leader since mao zedong after a congress that enshrined his own political theory into the constitution. xi told the gathering of chinese and international reporters and a tv audience of millions about the  great rejuvenation of the chinese nation  and the  waves of positive energy  from the ruling communist party, but people in fengxian were more concerned about local matters.  fengxian has seen its population decline as its youth head into the cities for fresh opportunities and better wages, but rapid urbanization and a campaign to build a  new socialist countryside  through government infrastructure spending has transformed the area.   the leaders have been paying a lot of attention with the waterways, roads and whatnot,  said gu, pointing to a new drainage channel running through the village.  i think the next five years are going to get better.  shen bo, a 31 year old grassroots communist party official in fengxian, told reuters that he was unfamiliar with most of the new leadership line up, but said he was proud of the  powerful  president xi, who had a  feeling for the times  and remained in touch with china s rural heartlands.  i can use three characters to describe him,  he said, using characters that mean  touching the ground , or  down to earth .   because he has studied the grassroots more, and that is my strongest impression of him.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump plunged into a deep crisis on friday after a bombshell 2005 recording came to light in which he boasted in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman and groping women, saying “when you’re a star, they let you do it.” a stream of republican leaders denounced the remarks, first published by the washington post, which threaten trump’s already shaky standing with women voters just a month ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. house of representatives speaker paul ryan, the top republican elected official, said he was “sickened” by the comments and said trump would no longer attend a campaign event in wisconsin with him on saturday. “i hope mr. trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,” ryan said in a statement. reince preibus, chairman of the republican national committee, said: “no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. ever.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the comments were “repugnant” and that trump “needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere.” u.s. representative jason chaffetz of utah, who has been one of clinton’s fiercest critics, said he had retracted his endorsement of trump, telling cnn he would not be able to look his 15 year old daughter in the eye if he voted for trump. utah’s republican governor gary herbert said on twitter he would also no longer vote for trump. “tonight, millions of republicans are facing a moment of truth,” herbert said. republican lawmaker mike coffman from colorado told cbs that trump should “step aside” and said “his defeat at this point seems almost certain.” trump was expected to release a video statement late on friday. earlier, in a brief written statement, trump shrugged off the leaked tape as “locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.” in the recorded conversation, trump was wearing a microphone and chatting on a bus with billy bush, then host of nbc’s “access hollywood” ahead of a segment they were about to tape. “i did try and fuck her. she was married,” trump said. “i moved on her like a bitch, but i couldn’t get there.” trump talked about his attraction to beautiful women. “i just start kissing them,” he said. “and when you’re a star they let you do it,” he said. “grab them by the pussy. you can do anything.” trump, who has brought up former president bill clinton’s infidelities as a criticism of hillary clinton, calling her a “total enabler,” responded to the audio. “bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close. i apologize if anyone was offended,” trump said. “access hollywood” confirmed the video in its own report, saying it discovered the comments in its library. billy bush said in a statement to variety he was “embarrassed and ashamed” of his comments. other prominent republicans also condemned the comments but stopped short of withdrawing their support for their candidate, including arizona senator john mccain and texas senator ted cruz. trump, known for his unconventional and controversial speaking style, has made a series of gaffes in his campaign, but the “graphic nature” of the clip will hurt his standing among women, independents, and wavering republicans, said david yepsen, director of the paul simon public policy institute at southern illinois university. “we’ve never seen something like this trump clip in a modern presidential campaign,” yepsen said, calling the incident “sad for the american political system” and for trump’s supporters. republican strategist ron bonjean said “this feels like it is quickly becoming a political ‘game over’” for trump. “unless voters don’t care about these issues or believe that this is simply political dirty tricks by releasing the videos now, trump is going to have to pull a rabbit out of his hat in order to turn things around,” bonjean said. still, trump’s past controversial comments have failed to shake his core supporters, said david axelrod, a former political adviser to democratic president barack obama. “appalling as the (trump) tape is, i’m reminded of all the times we have said, this time he’s really done,” axelrod said on twitter. the revelation comes right before sunday’s town hall style debate, seen as critical as trump tries to rebound from a dip in some opinion polls after a rocky performance in the first debate. clinton, who slammed trump’s comments as “horrific,” was also hit by a leak on friday. wikileaks published what appeared to be excerpts of her paid speeches to corporations, the transcripts of which the campaign has refused to release. the excerpts were likely to provide trump some fodder for attacking clinton in the debate. in them, she voices support for open trade and borders and discusses taking different positions in public and in private. however, yepsen said the excerpts would likely be eclipsed by trump’s clip. “the two things aren’t comparable,” he said. the u.s. government formally accused russia on friday of hacking democratic party organizations ahead of the presidential election. wikileaks has declined to name its sources. a spokesman for the clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the wikileaks emails were authentic and noted that other hacked documents have been faked.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate ben carson said he intends to continue campaigning through the republican national convention in july after a report on thursday said he planned a major downsizing of his flagging campaign. the washington post reported that carson planned to eliminate 50 staff positions, or nearly one half his staff. carson, in an appearance on the fox news channel, said the cuts have been months in the making after an examination found “inefficiencies” in his campaign.       “it’s the same kind of thing i would do as president,” the retired neurosurgeon said. “there is a lot of money being wasted, a lot of inefficiency in government and just because you have the funds to continue that inefficiency doesn’t mean that you should do it.” the bulk of the cuts will come from his field offices and headquarters in virginia, the washington post said, citing an internal memo and campaign officials. carson will also reduce salaries for campaign workers, it said. carson finished fourth among republican presidential hopefuls in the iowa caucuses on monday with less than 10 percent of the vote.  the newspaper said other cost saving measures included possibly using commercial flights instead of private planes and limiting carson’s travel team to a select few advisers. “we will be able to continue the campaign right until cleveland,” carson said, referring to the convention. “but obviously you always make appropriate adjustments to make sure you can accomplish your goal.” his most senior staffers will remain on the campaign team, according to the post.

" named the richest man in china on thursday with a net worth of $43 billion, property tycoon xu jiayin is likened by some media to donald trump, having built his fortune on a real estate business that has blossomed under a mountain of debt. the 59 year old xu s china evergrande group has a market value of $47 billion, although its total debt stands at more than $100 billion, an issue that has prompted some wary investors to short the stock.    evergrande, china s second most indebted company, has now pledged to cut its net debt ratio to around 70 percent by june 2020 from 240 percent and has raised $3.8 billion in new funds and exchanged $2.8 billion of existing debt this year.   thanks to a boom in the value of chinese property assets, xu s wealth has climbed by $30 billion in the past year to top the rich list compiled annually by the hurun report. evergrande, whose shares have surged 480 percent this year, is now ranked as the country s third largest developer by sales.  the stock s bull run to record highs accelerated this month, driven by plans for a backdoor listing in mainland china and the announcement of a target to reduce debt. xu s political stock is also high with the ruling communist party. he is a member of the chinese people s political consultative conference, the top advisory body. and the state council, china s cabinet, bestowed on him the title  national model worker    one of the country s highest civilian honors. earlier this year, xu, in his advisory role, proposed measures to alleviate poverty and hailed china s president.  we believe that under the strong leadership of the party central committee with general secretary xi jinping as the core, we would certainly win the battle against poverty,  xu said.      xu graduated from wuhan university of science and technology in 1982, and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in commerce by the university of west alabama in 2008.  he founded evergrande in 1996 and listed it in hong kong in 2009 after raising around hk$6 billion ($767 million) in an initial public offering.  acquisition hungry evergrande, which has developed thousands of middle class homes in china, made headlines in 2010 when it bought the main soccer club in its home town of guangzhou for 100 million yuan ($15 million).  in 2014, xu sold a half stake in the club to china s biggest e commerce company alibaba for $192 million. alibaba s founder jack ma said at the time that he and xu hatched the deal over dinner and drinks, and wrapped it up in just a few days. xu came under a less friendly spotlight in 2015, when australia ordered him to sell his a$39 million ($31 million) sydney mansion as part of a crackdown on foreigners whose buying had contributed to an overheated residential property market.

" cambodia s economy is forecast to grow 6.9 percent next year,  compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017, despite risks including uncertainties over next year s election, the world bank said on wednesday. cambodia s political turbulence has had little impact on economic growth, which has hovered around 7 percent for the past six years. the world bank said textile exports had moderated and the construction sector showed signs of slowing, but other manufacturing exports had increased and cambodia was also drawing more tourists   particularly from china.  the outlook remains positive,  it said in a report.  a possible slowdown of the regional economy, especially china, and potential election related uncertainties, however, pose downside risks to the outlook.  china is now cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor, but western donors remain important and cambodia has been increasingly at odds with them in the run up to the 2018 election. they have condemned the arrest of prime minister hun sen s main rival, kem sokha, the dissolution of the main opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) and a crackdown on civil rights groups and independent media. the government accuses kem sokha of plotting to take power with american help and his party of treason   charges the opposition says are politically motivated to ensure hun sen keeps his more than three decade hold on power. sweden said on tuesday it was stopping some aid and the united states said it was ending election funding and would take further concrete steps. world bank senior country economist miguel sanchez said uncertainty had affected cambodia in previous election years, leading to postponed investment decisions and a decline in foreign currency deposits.  it was temporary,  he told a news conference.

" a court in paris on monday released the younger brother of former burkina faso president blaise compaore pending consideration of a request by the burkinabe government to have him extradited, his lawyer and a judicial source said.  police detained francois compaore at charles de gaulle airport in paris on sunday on an international arrest warrant related to the 1998 murder of norbert zongo, who published burkina faso s independent newspaper. the killing of zongo, who had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for francois compaore, became a symbol of repression during blaise compaore s 27 year rule, which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising.  francois compaore is barred from leaving france until a court examines an extradition request by burkina faso s government, said a judicial source, speaking on condition of anonymity.      compaore s lawyer pierre olivier sur said the charges against his client are politically motivated by a burkinabe government unable to try blaise compaore, whom the government of neighboring ivory coast refuses to extradite.  blaise compaore fled to ivory coast during the uprising. he faces an international arrest warrant in connection with the 1987 murder of former president thomas sankara. activists are pushing president roch marc christian kabore to aggressively pursue cases of past human rights abuses. critics say his government has been too slow to move against former government members, some of whom serve in the current administration.

" myanmar s army chief called on thursday for people internally displaced by violence in rakhine state to go home and rebuild communities, but he made no mention of 422,000 rohingya muslims who fled to bangladesh to escape his force s operations. senior general min aung hlaing, in a major speech on his plans for rakhine state on his first visit there since the latest strife erupted, said the military had handled the situation as best as it could after a wave of coordinated attacks by rohingya insurgents on aug. 25. the united nations has said the military response to the insurgent attacks is ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing the rohingya muslim community out of buddhist majority myanmar. myanmar denies that, saying its forces are waging a legitimate campaign against muslim terrorists who have been attacking and torching villages of buddhists and other non muslims, some 30,000 of whom were internally displaced. min aung hlaing did not mention the accusation of ethnic cleansing in his speech to business people, officials and some of the displaced, in sittwe, the state capital.  regarding the rehabilitation of villages of our national races, for the national races who fled their homes, first of all they must go back to their places,  he said.  national races  is a myanmar term referring to members of officially recognized indigenous ethnic groups who make up the diverse nation. the rohingya are not recognized as a  national race , and are instead seen as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. animosity between buddhists in rakhine state and the rohingya goes back generations, but has seethed in recent years, fueled in part by a surge of buddhist nationalism since nearly five decades of strict military rule came to an end.  the important thing is to have our people in the region. it s necessary to have control of our region with our national races,  min aung hlaing said.  we can t do anything if there are no people from our national races ... that is their rightful place.  min aung hlaing did not refer to the return of muslims to their villages in the north of the state, almost half of which have been abandoned and torched. the crisis has drawn international condemnation and calls from the united nations and u.s. president donald trump for the military to stop the violence and support diplomatic efforts for a long term solution for the rohingya. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi, in her first address to the nation on the crisis on tuesday, said myanmar was ready to start a verification process to take back refugees, under a 1993 arrangement with bangladesh.  refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem,  she said. min aung hlaing did not mention the return of refugees from bangladesh.

" foreigners aiming for temporary jobs at high tech u.s. companies will undergo a longer visa approval process after the trump administration announced it will temporarily suspend expedited applications for h 1b visas. the u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) said on friday that starting april 3 it will suspend “premium processing” for up to six months. under this expedited procedure, applicants can be eligible for visa approvals within 15 days, instead of a regular review period that can last for up to a few months. the h 1b non immigrant visa allows u.s. companies to employ graduate level workers in several specialized fields, including information technology, medicine, engineering and mathematics. uscis said that during the suspension period, individuals still can request expedited consideration, but must meet certain criteria, such as humanitarian reasons, an emergency situation or the prospect of severe financial loss to a company or individual. the united states currently caps h 1b visas at 65,000 a year, with an additional 20,000 allowed for those who have earned advanced college degrees in the united states. the visa is valid for three years but can be extended for an additional three years. the agency said that suspending premium processing will allow it to reduce a backlog of long pending visa petitions and thus reduce overall h 1b processing times. the move comes as the trump administration also has been implementing tougher deportation procedures against illegal immigrants in the united states and has attempted to impose a visa ban on people from seven primarily muslim countries. that ban was put on hold by a federal court. president donald trump campaigned last year on a promise to crack down on immigrants who he said were taking jobs from u.s. citizens.

" new york city has quietly begun removing some of the corroding yellow nuclear fallout shelter signs that were appended to thousands of buildings in the 1960s, saying many are misleading cold war relics that no longer denote functional shelters. the small metal signs are a remnant of the anxieties over the nuclear arms race between the united states and the former soviet union, which prompted u.s. president john f. kennedy to create the shelter program in 1961 in cities across the nation. the signs, with their simple design of three joined triangles inside a circle, became an emblem of the era. while some new yorkers may barely notice them today, to others they can be an uneasy reminder that the threat may have altered and diminished, but it has not vanished. although the cold war era has long ended, north korea continues working to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states amid bellicose rhetoric from washington and pyongyang. a nuclear explosion is now seen as even less likely than during the cold war. but should catastrophe ever strike, the signs, which still linger in their thousands, would be best ignored, city officials and disaster preparedness experts say.  in the aftermath of a nearby nuclear explosion, any survivors counting on the signs to lead them to safety from radioactive fallout after needlessly dashing outside would likely find themselves rattling locked doors or perhaps breaking into what is now a building s laundry room or bike storage area. maintenance of the shelter system, which once entailed federal funding to stock shelters with food and water, ended decades ago.  the removal of some of the signs from public school buildings, which has not previously been reported, is intended to partly reduce this potential confusion, according to the city s department of education. michael aciman, a department spokesman, confirmed that any designated fallout shelters created in the city s schools are no longer active and said that the department is aiming to finish unscrewing the signs from school walls by roughly jan. 1. although some of the tens of thousands of fallout shelter signs placed around the city by the federal government s office of civil defense have vanished as old buildings have been renovated or demolished, city officials say this is the first coordinated effort to remove them. the office of civil defense was eventually abolished in the 1970s, subsumed into the federal emergency management agency (fema). aciman declined to say whether, given the signs are technically federal property, the u.s. government was consulted. but fema said it did not mind anyway.  fema does not have a position regarding the signs,  jenny burke, a fema spokeswoman, wrote in an email on tuesday. although the agency does not maintain lists of the old shelter locations, she added,  as a part of an ongoing planning effort, the agency is conducting research to retrieve office of civilian defense records.      the city s removal appeared somewhat haphazard: on one brooklyn street, a sign on a school photographed by reuters this month was subsequently removed, while a second school a few blocks away still had its sign attached, albeit with a screw missing. as a history buff, jeff schlegelmilch is fond enough of the signs that he stuck a replica on his office door at columbia university s national center for disaster preparedness, where he is deputy director.  i love seeing the signs, but, as a disaster planner, they have to come down,  he said.  at best, they are ignored, at worst, they re misleading and are going to cost people s lives.  the consensus now, from the federal government downward, was that designated shelters were an outmoded concept, and updated contingency plans have been widely adopted since al qaeda s attack on the united states on sept. 11, 2001, schlegelmilch said.  were a nuclear explosion ever to happen, those far enough from the blast center to survive would do well to head to the lower interiors of any standard residential or commercial building, ideally a windowless basement, to shelter from radioactive particles outside, which can burn skin and cause serious illness and death. cars, on the other hand,  are terrible,  schlegelmilch said: the particles sail right through a vehicle s thin exterior. nyc emergency management, the agency that runs the city s disaster preparations, was not involved in the decision but staff there welcomed the signs  removal. nancy silvestri, the agency s press secretary, said even once the signs are gone from schools, many would remain on apartment buildings and other structures. city officials are uncertain who has jurisdiction over those, she said.  eliot calhoun, the agency s chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives planner, sees the signs as unhelpfully muddying the waters.  he has spent years endlessly finessing a message, designed to flash as an alert on cellphones, that he hopes he will never have to send. in the nerve center of the agency s brooklyn headquarters,  he called up onto a screen its current form:  nuclear explosion reported. shelter in basement/center of building, close windows/doors.   every single time i look at it i change it a little bit,  he said.  when you only have 90 characters and you re trying to save lives you can really think too much about it.

" peruvian nobel prize winning author mario vargas llosa said on tuesday that donald trump was a “clown” and a “racist” who would doom the republican party to defeat if it chose him as its candidate for november’s u.s. presidential election. “he is a danger to the united states,” said vargas llosa, who himself ran as a center right candidate for the peruvian presidency in 1990. “it is a country that is too important for the rest of the world to have in the white house a clown, a demagogue and a racist like mr trump,” he told a news conference in madrid to launch his new novel, “cinco esquinas” (“five corners”). trump, the frontrunner in the republican primaries, has said he wants to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico and deport 11 million illegal immigrants. he also suggested, at his campaign launch last june, that mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers. vargas llosa said trump’s “seemingly unstoppable” campaign would guarantee another term for the democratic party.  “hillary clinton surely will win a massive victory if the republican candidate is donald trump,” he said.  vargas llosa, 79, won the nobel literature prize in 2010 and now lives mainly in madrid. he is known for books such as “the time of the hero” that explore latin america’s structures of political power.

" whether they like president donald trump or not, the u.s. veterans who gather at hoa’s place in danang show little concern that he avoided the war that marked their lives. trump flies into the vietnamese resort of danang on friday for a summit of asia pacific leaders, landing in a city that for many americans of his generation was their first sight of vietnam   and of war. “he’ll finally be able to put on his resume that he was in vietnam,” said david clark, 68, who is originally from akron, ohio and calls trump “a joke”. after serving in vietnam from 1968 to 1969 with the marine corps, he has now returned to help with projects to address the legacy of the war. trump never served in the military. he received five deferments during the vietnam war, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the new york times reported last year. the paper quoted trump as saying the bones spurs had been “temporary”.     “everyone i know tried to avoid it,” said draftee keith soukkala, sipping a beer at hoa’s place, a favored bar of veterans near danang’s “china beach”. “i stayed out as long as i could but i didn’t have any bone spurs,” said soukkala, who splits his time between vietnam and alaska and said he voted for trump. at 73, he is two years older than trump and recalls landing in danang to the humid heat and “a certain smell in the air” at the start of a 13 month tour with the marine corps dodging bombs hidden by the communist viet cong guerrillas. the seaside resort of danang has a special place in u.s. vietnamese history: it was here that the first u.s. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory. close to some of the heaviest fighting in central vietnam, danang had a big u.s. air base. china beach was a relaxation spot for u.s. soldiers back from combat. now, danang’s beachfront hotels draw tourists from around the world. gleaming office towers mark it out as one of vietnam’s most modern cities and one the communist government sought to showcase with the hosting of the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit which trump will attend. it’s also home to a community of u.s. veterans who returned to a country where a recent pew research survey showed the united states was viewed favorably by 84 percent of people. clark came back in 2013 for a year and is still in danang, busy with projects to destroy unexploded u.s. bombs and help families affected by the agent orange defoliant linked to illness and deformity. mark o’connor, 67, of sioux falls, south dakota, and once part of a helicopter assault team, visits as often as he can to provide bicycles to children in hill villages.      on this visit, though, he said he had come back in the hope of seeing trump   his support unaffected by the fact the president had not served in vietnam. “you know, more power to him,” he said. “you can’t feel bad about him and not feel bad about everyone who went to canada to avoid the draft.” ",0
" callista gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the u.s. house of representatives, on friday became u.s. ambassador to the vatican, which is at odds with washington over immigration, climate change and jerusalem. callista gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to pope francis at the vatican to officially assume her role. her husband newt gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of u.s. president donald trump. newt gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to fox news from his new base in rome. trump’s nomination of callista gingrich to the post at the holy see in may caused some controversy because of her marriage to gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. both are roman catholic. on thursday they attended the funeral at the vatican of cardinal bernard law, who resigned as archbishop of boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  the pope has implicitly criticized trump’s decision to pull out of the paris accord on climate change. he said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were “perverse attitudes” that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet. francis is also opposed to trump’s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital. the pontiff has called for respect for the city’s “status quo,” saying new tension in the middle east would further inflame world conflicts.. on thursday at the united nations, where the vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition. the u.s. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador “looks forward to working with the holy see to defend human rights, advance religious freedom, combat human trafficking, and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world”.

" the leader of the group that won this year s nobel peace prize on sunday urged nuclear nations to adopt a united nations treaty banning atomic weapons in order to prevent  the end of us . the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons (ican) was awarded this year s nobel peace prize by a nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons and the growing risk of an atomic war.   ican is a coalition of 468 grassroots non governmental groups that campaigned for a u.n. treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, adopted by 122 nations in july. the treaty is not signed by   and would not apply to   any of the states that already have nuclear arms. beatrice fihn, ican s executive director, urged them to sign the agreement.   it provides a choice. a choice between the two endings: the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,  she said in her speech at the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo.  the united states, choose freedom over fear. russia, choose disarmament over destruction. britain, choose the rule of law over oppression,  she added, before urging france, china, india, pakistan, north korea and israel to do the same. israel is widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.  a moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities,  she added.   a calculated military escalation could lead to the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians.   fihn delivered the nobel lecture together with setsuko thurlow, an 85 year old survivor of the hiroshima atomic bombing and now an ican campaigner. thurlow recalled on stage on sunday some of her memories of the attack on aug. 6, 1945.  she was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometers (1.1 mile) from ground zero, she said. most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive.   processions of ghostly figures shuffled by. grotesquely wounded people, they were bleeding, burnt, blackened and swollen,  she said.   parts of their bodies were missing. flesh and skin hung from their bones. some with their eyeballs hanging in their hands. some with their bellies burst open, their intestines hanging out. the foul stench of burnt human flesh filled the air.   the united states, britain and france sent second rank diplomats to the nobel ceremony, which fihn earlier told reuters was  some kind of protest . japan, which is the only country to suffer atomic bombings and now relies on the u.s. nuclear umbrella, has also not signed the treaty. in a statement late on sunday, japanese foreign minister taro kono expressed respect for the efforts of atomic bombings survivors toward a nuclear weapons free world. but he added:  it is essential to steadily seek ways to advance nuclear disarmament realistically, while responding appropriately to real threats, including north korea s nuclear and missile development programs.  graphic of nobel laureates   tmsnrt.rs/2y6atvw ",0
" the united states stopped election support for cambodia with a promise of more  concrete steps  and the european union threatened vital trade preferences after the main opposition party to prime minister hun sen was banned. but china said it supported cambodia in following its own path, making no criticism of the government led by the former khmer rouge commander who is one of beijing s most important allies in southeast asia after more than three decades in power. the ban on the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp), decreed by the supreme court at the government s request, followed the arrest of its leader for treason. kem sokha is accused of plotting to take power with american help. hun sen s critics called the cnrp dissolution an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy. western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system following decades of war.  on current course, next year s election will not be legitimate, free or fair,  a white house statement said, promising to take  concrete steps . the first of those was to end support for the cambodian national election committee ahead of the 2018 election, it said. in april, the u.s. embassy announced a $1.8 million grant to assist local elections in 2017 and next year s general election. in brussels, an eu spokesman said the election could not be legitimate without the opposition and noted that respect for human rights was a prerequisite for cambodia s access to eu trade preferences under its  everything but arms scheme.  that scheme, giving tariff free access, and similar trade preferences in the united states have helped cambodia build a garment industry on low cost labor. between them, eu and u.s. markets take some 60 percent of cambodia s exports.  i am very worried after the dissolution of the party,  factory sewer heng kheang, 35, said as other colleagues nodded in agreement at their lunch break.  workers will be most affected, more than the rich.   in a symbolic step, the u.s. senate passed a resolution calling on the treasury and state departments to consider placing cambodian officials implicated in abuses on a watch list for asset freezes and travel bans. huy vannak, undersecretary of state at cambodia s interior ministry who is close to hun sen, said the u.s. position was  made without consideration to the evidence and court hearing .  we hope that the u.s. will consider the overall bilateral relations with cambodia and continue to collaborate with common interests of both countries,  he said. in beijing, foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a news briefing that china supported cambodia in pursuing its own development path. china is by far the biggest single donor to cambodia and its biggest investor. hun sen has been in a deepening war of words with the u.s. embassy and state department over a crackdown on his critics, but at the weekend posed with u.s. president donald trump at a regional summit and praised his policies of non interference. the fact that the threat of action came from the white house gave it greater weight than previous statements from the state department calling for the release of kem sokha. so far, western countries have shown little appetite for sanctions and the opposition itself has shied away from calling for steps to restrict garment exports because of the hundreds of thousands of workers who depend on them. but leaders of the cnrp now say they support some sanctions.  sanctions are the best leverage for negotiation for free, fair and inclusive elections,  said mu sochua, a deputy to cnrp leader kem sokha, who fled cambodia fearing arrest. there have been no protests over the opposition party ban and many people in the capital, phnom penh, said they were afraid to speak out. there were no party members at the cnrp headquarters on friday, only security guards.  they are worried about their safety,  said guard chin savy. the central market was full of its usual bustle and one man told reuters he was glad to see the back of the opposition.  hun sen has a lot of help from china. if he just depended on the u.s., we wouldn t be anywhere,  said khen kong, 69, a businessman. in a televised address on thursday, hun sen told cambodians the election would go ahead  as normal  and appealed to politicians from the cnrp who had not been banned to join his cambodian people s party. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein expressed grave concern about the conduct of credible elections next year as well as a clampdown on civil rights groups and independent media.

" president donald trump said on monday he wants u.s. senator orrin hatch of utah to run for re election next year, putting trump on a collision course with republican rival mitt romney, who wants to run for hatch’s seat. hatch, 83, has made noises about retiring from the senate seat he has held since 1977. republican officials say romney, a utah resident who was the 2012 republican presidential nominee, has been preparing to run for hatch’s seat next year.  but trump, who has clashed with romney in the past, said he wants hatch to run for re election. “you are a true fighter, orrin, i have to say,” trump said at an event in salt lake city, utah’s capital. “we hope you will continue to serve your state and your country in the senate for a very long time to come.” asked if he was going seek re election, hatch told reporters: “we’ll have to see.” he called trump’s endorsement “certainly is a nice thing,” but did not say whether it would influence his decision. romney, 70, a former governor of massachusetts who spends a great deal of time in utah, has been expecting to run for hatch’s seat in a state that republicans typically win. romney made clear that he took a dim view of trump’s endorsement on monday of republican roy moore for a u.s. senate seat in alabama that will be decided in a special election next week. moore has been accused by at least seven women of sexual improprieties they said occurred decades ago. several were teenagers at the time. moore has denied the accusations and said he is the victim of a witch hunt. “roy moore in the us senate would be a stain on the gop and on the nation,” romney wrote on twitter. “leigh corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. no vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.” trump considered picking romney as his secretary of state a year ago but opted instead for rex tillerson. in august, romney demanded trump apologize for saying that both sides were to blame for violence at a white supremacist rally in charlottesville, virginia. trump did not apologize. trump demurred on monday when asked whether he was trying to send romney a message by encouraging hatch to run again. “he’s a good man. mitt’s a good man,” trump said.

" the u.s. house intelligence committee on saturday said it had reached an agreement related to its subpoena of a washington research firm’s bank records that would secure access to records for the panel’s probe of russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. the announcement came a day after a federal judge had given an unnamed bank more time to respond to the congressional panel’s subpoena to fusion gps, the research outfit that hired a former british spy to compile a dossier on presidential candidate donald trump.  the washington free beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire republican mega donor paul singer, said on friday it was the original funder of the fusion gps project to compile opposition research on multiple republican presidential candidates, including trump. trump and other republicans have alleged that russians paid fusion gps for research on their own dealings with the president and his campaign. but the free beacon said all the material it was provided came from public sources and that the effort was separate from a former british spy’s dossier of allegations of russian financial and personal links to president donald trump’s campaign and associates. known as the steele dossier because it was compiled by former mi6 officer christopher steele, the document identified russian businessmen and others whom u.s. intelligence analysts have concluded are russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the russian government. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign and the democratic national committee began paying fusion gps in april 2016 for research on trump, an arrangement that later produced the steele dossier. trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax, has repeatedly called the dossier fake news. much of the inflammatory and at times salacious content of the dossier has not been verified. however, u.s. officials have confirmed certain details. in a closed door hearing with senate judiciary committee investigators, fusion gps founder glenn simpson said there was no connection between the firm’s work on the dossier and its legal research on a lawsuit involving russians who attended a june 2016 trump tower meeting with trump’s son, donald trump jr., his son in law and close aide, jared kushner, and former campaign chief paul manafort, sources familiar with the hearing said.

" u.s. president donald trump called on “israel to be reasonable with respect to peace”, spelling out in his own words his administration’s stance that new settlements on palestinian land may not be helpful in an interview with an israeli newspaper.  trump’s comments to israel today come as he tones down his pro israel bravado ahead of prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s trip to the white house on feb. 15. “i want israel to be reasonable with respect to peace. i want to see peace happen,” trump said in the interview published on friday. “i would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties, and i think we have a good chance of doing that.”  during his 2016 election campaign, trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians. he talked of moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem, naming an ambassador who backs israel’s settlement program and exerting no pressure on israel for peace talks. now trump is adopting a more measured stance. even though the white house did not join the widespread criticism this week of a new israeli law which retroactively legalizes about 4,000 existing settler homes, its pro israel approach shows signs of being more nuanced.  “they [settlements] don’t help the process. i can say that,” trump told the israeli daily owned by u.s. casino mogul sheldon adelson, a netanyahu supporter and republican party donor. “every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left,” trump said. “i am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace.” the president said his administration was “looking at some other options” regarding the settlements.       he also said he was still studying the case for relocating the u.s. embassy to jerusalem, a move that could anger the arab world.  “the embassy is not an easy decision. it has obviously been out there for many, many years, and nobody has wanted to make that decision. i’m thinking about it very seriously, and we will see what happens,” trump said.

" president donald trump’s travel ban on citizens of six muslim majority nations faces its second challenge at a u.s. appeals court next month, and this time more republican states are backing the measure, while one democratic state attorney general dropped out of the legal fight this week. some legal experts say the states’ realignment could signal that the changes made last month to trump’s original executive order have strengthened the government’s case. sixteen democratic state attorneys general and the district of colombia on thursday filed a “friend of the court” brief backing hawaii in its bid to block the march 6 executive order, which two federal judges put on hold before it could be implemented. hawaii and other states argue the ban violates the u.s. constitution because it discriminates against muslims. but pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro, who opposed the original ban that trump signed on jan. 27, did not join thursday’s brief, which was filed in the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals in san francisco. shapiro declined to comment.  on the other side, texas, which had been alone in its support for the original january order, has gained the support of 14 republican states urging that the ban go forward in a legal brief filed on april 10. those states back the government’s argument that the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the ban is needed to prevent terrorist attacks. trump’s original ban, which the president said was needed for national security to head off attacks by islamist militants, applied to seven muslim majority nations and indefinitely banned the entry of all refugees from syria. it was revised and narrowed after a flurry of legal challenges. “the second executive order was much more carefully written than the first. maybe when various states analyzed it they weren’t as interested as joining,” said stephen yale loehr an immigration expert at cornell university law school. however, he said, “amicus briefs sometimes are filed for political reasons.”  some judges pay close attention to amicus briefs, while others disregard them. the u.s. department of justice declined to comment. trump’s january order was hastily implemented just days after his inauguration, leading to chaos and protests at airports and more than two dozen lawsuits. a federal judge in seattle halted the order and the 9th circuit upheld that ruling. the white house re crafted the order to exclude legal permanent residents and removed iraq from the list of targeted countries. iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen are still included in the new order. the new ban also dropped language giving preference to refugees who are part of a persecuted religious minority in their country of citizenship. the changes were meant to chip away at the plaintiffs’ “standing” to sue, which requires that anyone bringing a lawsuit show they have been directly harmed by the action they are contesting.  but as soon as the second order was signed, states and civil rights groups went back to court, saying that it was still discriminatory.  federal district judges in maryland and hawaii put the second order on hold before it could take effect on march 16.   the judge in hawaii blocked the two central sections of the ban, on travel and refugees, while the maryland judge only halted the travel portion.  most of the focus is now on the hawaii case, which is being heard by the 9th circuit on may 15.  the 4th circuit appeals court in virginia is slated to hear arguments in the maryland case on may 8.  not all states have staked out a side in the fight. pennsylvania now is among 18 states, including michigan, ohio, and new jersey that have not taken sides on the issue, opting not to file any legal briefs.

" south africa s nb publishers said on friday it had received a letter from the state security agency (ssa) ordering it to pull a new book on president jacob zuma off the shelves as it contravened the intelligence service act. the publishers said they stood by  the president s keepers   those keeping zuma in power and out of prison , and its lawyers would respond to the letter sent by the ssa. the book by journalist jacques pauw alleges millions of dollars in taxpayers  money flowed into the bank accounts of spies and zuma s government and details the actions of law enforcement agencies. it alleges zuma failed to submit tax returns for the first five years of his presidency. the president s office has issued a statement rejecting the accusations contained in the book, adding that zuma had declared all income received to tax authorities.  the ssa warns nb publishers in a letter seen by reuters that it will launch criminal charges if the book is not withdrawn.   noting your admission that you did not seek the views of the people apparently implicated, it is not surprising that this book is replete with inaccuracies,  the ssa said in the letter sent to nb publishers by its lawyers kgoroeadira mudau inc. the letter said the book contained elements in contravention of the country s intelligence service act. no ssa spokesperson was available for further comment. a spokeswoman for nb publishers said its lawyers were handling the matter.  we have received the letter but have not pulled the book yet because our attorneys have been given time to respond,  jean pieters, nb publisher s spokeswoman said.

" thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the white house, donald trump captured the 2016 republican presidential nomination on tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn. his eldest child, donald trump jr., announced the support of new york, their home state, during a roll call vote at the republican national convention, ensuring trump had the majority of delegates   1,237   needed to contest the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election against presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton. with three of the candidate’s other children at his side, the younger trump said: “it is my honor to be able to throw donald trump over the top in the delegate count tonight.” “congratulations, dad. we love you,” he said. trump’s democratic rival, clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: “donald trump just became the republican nominee. chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the oval office.” trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by u.s. senator ted cruz of texas with 475 delegates, ohio governor john kasich with 120 and u.s. senator marco rubio of florida with 114. three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates. after the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated indiana governor mike pence, 57, trump’s choice for his vice presidential running mate. speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, trump appeared on a video screen from new york promising to win the election in november, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard u.s. borders and “restore law and order” in the united states. the state by state vote to put trump’s name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four day convention, and after a speech by his wife, melania, drew accusations of plagiarism. a wealthy new york real estate developer best known to americans for his starring role in a long running tv show, “the apprentice,” where his catchphrase was “you’re fired,” the 70 year old trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office. on tuesday, under the headline “make america work again,” speakers at cleveland’s quicken loans basketball arena were meant to assail democratic president barack obama’s record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power. instead, speaker after speaker took aim at clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary americans and the inheritor of obama’s “oppressive” administration. a former secretary of state under obama, clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the democratic national convention next week in philadelphia. trump trails clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising republican primary season. trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday.  trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the republican nomination.  within weeks of announcing his candidacy at trump tower in new york on june 16, 2015, trump had taken a commanding lead in the republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on tuesday night   former florida governor jeb bush, part of a republican political dynasty. in a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white middle america, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment republicans like bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to “make america great again”. “we’ve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions,” donald trump jr. said in a convention speech. “we’re still americans. we’re still one country and we’re going to get it all back.” “i know we’ll get it back because i know my father,” trump jr. said. opponents brand trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of muslims and to build a border wall with mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. underscoring the problems trump has faced with u.s. allies abroad, german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said trump threatened u.s. and world security with his “politics of fear and isolation.” steinmeier told reuters in a written interview that he was concerned about what he called trump’s ambiguous vows to “make america strong again,” while simultaneously reducing its engagement overseas. party officials hope to use the convention to smooth out some of trump’s rough edges and present him as a job creator and a strong hand to combat security threats at home and abroad. u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, an early backer of trump, placed his name in nomination, calling him “a warrior and a winner.” two senior republicans, u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, spoke in favor of trump. republicans need trump to do well in the november election as they seek to preserve republican majorities in congress. security forces were on high alert in cleveland. but police said late on tuesday there had been only five arrests since the convention began on monday. wright state university, a public university near dayton, ohio, said on tuesday it had decided not to host the first u.s. presidential debate scheduled for sept. 26, citing mounting costs and security concerns. the event will now be held at hofstra university in new york. while in cleveland, trump ally chris christie said on tuesday that should trump win the presidency, he would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by obama  and could ask congress to pass legislation making it easier to dismiss public workers. christie, who is governor of new jersey and leads trump’s white house transition team, told dozens of donors the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if trump defeats clinton.

" president donald trump’s personal lawyer’s legal arguments in defense of the president’s tweets about former u.s. national security advisor michael flynn have been greeted with some skepticism by legal experts. in seeking to explain a trump tweet on saturday lawyer john dowd told reuters on sunday that he wrote and “bollixed up” the president’s tweet in which trump said he fired michael flynn for lying to the fbi and not just misleading u.s. vice president mike pence.  some observers have said the tweet showed trump knew flynn had committed a crime and sought to obstruct justice by, among other actions, firing then fbi director james comey.  dowd denied trump knew flynn had lied to the fbi, but raised new questions by also providing a further account of the january meetings in which former acting u.s. attorney general sally yates warned white house counsel don mcgahn that flynn was a security risk because he had lied about his conversations with former russian ambassador sergey kislyak. according to dowd, yates told mcgahn that flynn said the same thing to the fbi as he did to pence but yates did not convey that flynn was facing criminal prosecution. dowd said mcgahn reported the conversation to trump in that manner. “you may conclude that’s a lie, but the department of justice, that had the power to charge, did not,” dowd said. “the first time the president knows for a fact this guy lies was when he was charged.” but several lawyers said, regardless of whether yates explicitly said flynn lied to the fbi, the white house counsel should have seen that possibility and communicated it to the president. “it’s not every day that the acting attorney general comes over to the white house with that sort of message,” said alex whiting, a former federal prosecutor now teaching at harvard law school. “it had to have been obvious to mcgahn that flynn probably lied to the fbi whether yates said it or not.” michael gerhardt, a law professor at the university of north carolina, called dowd’s argument “a stretch” but said there might be a “bit of credibility” in the idea that mcgahn might have been waiting for more clarity before informing the president about flynn’s criminal liability. neither yates nor mcgahn could be reached for comment on monday. dowd also declined requests for further comment on monday. yates’ testimony in may before a senate committee, in which she said she declined to answer mcgahn when he asked about flynn’s fbi interview, appears to conflict with dowd’s account. according to a person familiar with the matter, yates never said  that flynn told fbi agents the same thing he told pence. dowd said he stood by his version of events. flynn pleaded guilty last friday to a charge of lying to the fbi brought by special counsel robert mueller, who is leading a probe into alleged russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by the trump administration. russia has denied meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and trump has denied any collusion took place between russia and his election campaign. dowd also argued on sunday that trump could not commit the crime of obstruction of justice because “he’s the chief law enforcement officer of the u.s.” former prosecutor robert ray said there was some merit to the argument that trump could not obstruct justice by firing comey because he had the power do so. but several other lawyers took issue with dowd’s comments, noting president richard nixon faced impeachment for obstruction of justice prior to his resignation over the watergate scandal. “it’s a patently absurd argument,” said andrew wright, a former white house lawyer under president barack obama. “the president as the chief executive sits on top of the org chart, but he has to take care to see that the law is followed.” ",0
" former fbi director james comey is delaying an appearance before the u.s. house oversight committee that had been planned for wednesday, the panel’s chairman said on monday. in a post on twitter, chairman jason chaffetz, who will step down from his seat in congress in june, said he had spoken with comey who told him that before testifying in public he wanted to speak with former federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller, the special counsel investigating ties between russia and the presidential election campaign of donald trump. an aide to the oversight committee could not confirm when the hearing would be rescheduled. president trump fired comey on may 9. after reports that trump asked comey to stop investigating his campaign advisors ties, deputy attorney general rod rosenstein hired mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation, a move expected to delay congressional hearings into russian ties.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on thursday said rival donald trump had no real plans to help middle class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession. “he’s offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today,” clinton said in warren, michigan, shortly after touring futuramic, a hangar like, high tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry. clinton said trump, the republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on “millionaires and wall street money managers,” and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy. clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. the new york businessman is counting on his appeal to blue collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as pennsylvania and ohio. clinton on thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the nov. 8 election. speaking to fox news later on thursday, trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the united states, while clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan. trump delivered an economic speech in detroit on monday. he publicly named his economic advisers last week, which clinton mocked as “six guys named steve.” on thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. new members included roofing billionaire diane hendricks, investor carla sands and hedge funder anthony scaramucci. workers’ anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and clinton rejected the portrait trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the trans pacific partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009 2013 but has more recently opposed. clinton also says she would renegotiate the north american free trade agreement, which was signed by former president bill clinton, her husband. trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for american jobs.  “it’s true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the american people with rosy scenarios that didn’t pan out,” clinton told the crowd of factory workers. “the answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world. “the answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,” she said. “so my message to every worker in michigan and across america is this: i will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the trans pacific partnership.” ",0

" a lottery drawing to settle a tied virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on tuesday, after the democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. the decision to put off the high stakes lotto, originally scheduled for wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by a single vote.  a victory by simonds would shift republicans’ slim control of the 100 member house of delegates to an even 50 50 split with the democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power sharing arrangement. a day after simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey. that decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of newport news in southeastern virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. simonds asked a state court to reconsider on tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. an image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by simonds’ name. the voter selected republicans for other offices. simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, “recounts would become a never ending spiral of courtroom challenges.” the chairman of the virginia board of elections, james alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered “an action of last resort.” he added: “any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.”    yancey’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the virginia house republican caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. “we believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,” spokesman parker slaybaugh said. virginia department of elections spokeswoman andrea gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. democrats notched historic gains in virginia’s statehouse elections last month, part of the party’s first big wave of political victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. before the nov. 7 general election, virginia republicans held 66 seats to the democrats’ 34 in the house of delegates, along with a majority in the state senate.

" three teenagers were arrested on wednesday and accused of three separate assaults during a demonstration that turned violent outside a rally for presidential candidate donald trump last week in san jose, california, police said.  the three unidentified juveniles, all males, were accused of taking part in a number of skirmishes between trump supporters and anti trump demonstrators last thursday outside the san jose convention center. trump held a rally there in the lead up to tuesday’s california primary for the republican party’s presidential nomination. two of the teenagers, aged 16 and 17, face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon. the third, also 16, faces a misdemeanor battery charge, the san jose police department said in a statement. one of the teenagers is accused of using a blunt object to strike a victim from behind. the victim suffered visible injuries, according to police.  four others were arrested during the protests last week. two 19 year olds and an 18 year old face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon, while another 19 year old faces a misdemeanor charge of refusal to disperse.  it is unclear whether the seven charged were trump supporters or among the hundreds of protesters who were seen on news clips waving mexican flags, chanting anti trump slogans, and burning trump hats and at least one u.s. flag.  protesters, many angry over trump’s comments against illegal immigration, have gathered at his rallies for months. trump, now the republican party’s presumptive nominee for the nov. 8 presidential election, canceled a rally in chicago in march after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump on thursday appeared to weigh into a debate over a controversial u.s. biofuels program with a proposal that would back the position of billionaire investor carl icahn, one of his wealthiest backers. in a factsheet on economic policy, the trump campaign slammed a system of buying and selling biofuel blending credits that it said was bankrupting smaller oil refiners.  the system is a central part of the renewable fuel standard (rfs), the federal program that requires fuel sold in the united states to contain a minimum volume of biofuels, such as ethanol. the comments were later removed from the trump campaign website. a trump spokesman said an incorrect version of the factsheet was temporarily placed online. he said trump remains committed to the renewable fuel standard. it was unclear whether the comments reflected a changed stance from trump on the country’s more than decade old rfs program, which he has previously voiced support for. but they echoed the position of icahn, who recently called on federal regulators to level the playing field in the credits system to favor independent refiners like cvr energy inc (cvi.n), in which icahn is the majority shareholder. icahn’s office did not return an email and call when asked to comment. “these regulations will give big oil an oligopoly by destroying the small to mid size refineries,” the factsheet on trump’s economic policies said. “these requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country,” it added.    the comments underscored a growing schism within the oil sector pitting large oil companies against independent oil refiners. it also touches on a debate between the interests of big oil and big corn, which strongly backs the mandated use of ethanol in fuels and the credit system to make it work.  the rfs has hurt independent refiners, who do not always have the ability to mix biofuels into their gasoline and diesel before they send it to gas stations. to sell their gasoline without the required biofuel content, they have to buy credits from oil companies that have blended the fuels. those credits have cost the companies billions of dollars, and 2016 looks set to be the most expensive on record to buy the credits, known as rins.philadelphia energy solutions inc pesc.n said last week that it plans to slash benefits and reduce staff, citing the high cost of buying rins as one of the principal reasons it needed to make the cuts. independent refiners are pressing environmental regulators for changes to the program that could increase the amount of credits the larger companies need, industry sources have said. for its part, big oil favors a repeal of the whole program, rather than a tweak that may land it with increased costs. biofuels advocates also are against a change to the program.

" the house of representatives passed legislation on wednesday to block the purchase of “heavy water” from iran, defying president barack obama’s veto threat a year after the announcement of the landmark iran nuclear agreement. the house passed the “no 2h2o from iran act” by 249 176, with support coming almost exclusively from republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the chamber. every congressional republican, and a few of obama’s fellow democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between iran and the united states and other world powers announced last july 14 in which tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. they argued that obama was so eager to bolster his foreign policy legacy that he agreed to sanctions relief iran did not deserve because it lied about its nuclear program, supported militant groups that attack u.s. allies and perpetrated human rights abuses. deal opponents have repeatedly introduced legislation that the administration sees as efforts to undermine the international agreement. deal supporters said the agreement was the best way to defuse a dispute over iran’s nuclear program that threatened further middle east destabilization. heavy water is a non radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. the obama administration said in april the united states would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from iran, angering republicans who called it a subsidy of the country’s nuclear program. the white house issued a threat on monday to veto the bill, and two others the house is due to consider later this week. representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, denied that the house measure would violate the landmark pact. he said it would deter iran from producing heavy water by making its sale more difficult. separately, two senate republicans and two democrats said on wednesday they would introduce their own iran related bill. the measure introduced by republicans bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, and marco rubio and democrats robert menendez and joe manchin would expand sanctions for iran’s ballistic missile development, sanction transfers of conventional weapons to or from iran and extend the iran sanctions act. the iran sanctions act, which imposed sanctions over iran’s missile development and support for terrorism, expires at the end of 2016. lawmakers have been in discussions for months over the best way to address its renewal.

" washington’s decision to lift its ban on the sale of lethal weapons to vietnam is not aimed at china, u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on tuesday, describing the move as “very normal” and not provocative. kerry, who is accompanying president barack obama on a trip to vietnam, also urged china to peacefully resolve disputes with its neighbours, including vietnam, in the south china sea. “nothing we are doing here is focused on china,” kerry told reporters in ho chi minh city, a day after the lifting of a three decade old arms embargo on vietnam. “that is very normal, not out of order and certainly not inflammatory,” he said, referring to the embargo. “i hope china will read this correctly because our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relationships that are so key in this region.”     kerry called on china to engage diplomatically with vietnam and other neighbours to resolve disputes over territorial claims in the south china sea. china’s island reclamation there has stoked tensions with the united states   “i would caution china, as president obama and others have, to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are in contest,” kerry added, repeating that the united states welcomed the rise of a strong china. “we’re not saying china is wrong in its claims, we’re simply saying resolve it peacefully, resolve it through a rules based structure,” said kerry.

" wealthy, well educated voters helped carry republican presidential front runner donald trump to victory in this week’s east coast primaries, a demographic the famously blunt spoken billionaire had struggled to attract in the past. his sweep of pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, connecticut and rhode island on tuesday included wins in some of the richest and best educated counties in the country   like fairfield county, connecticut, and newport county, rhode island   and added to victories in his more traditional strongholds of white working class neighborhoods. exit polls from connecticut, pennsylvania and maryland showed trump winning about half of republican voters with college degrees, and over half of republican voters making more than $100,000 a year. “on its face, it is hard to believe he’d be improving with a demographic group that has been so averse to his style, his denigrating language,” said randall miller, a professor of american politics at saint joseph’s university in pennsylvania.  “but i think people may have gotten used to trump, he’s not as outrageous as he used to be,” he said, adding that familiarity with the businessman’s brand in the northeast may also have helped him. still, the five states could be an uphill battle for republicans in the nov. 8 presidential election. the last republican presidential nominee to win any of them was george h.w. bush in 1988. the challenge for the new york billionaire could be to replicate tuesday’s performance in other parts of the country as he seeks to lock down his party’s nomination, with 10 state contests remaining.     nationally, likely voters with a college degree have become increasingly critical of trump in recent months, according to reuters/ipsos polling. he is also increasingly unpopular with those who make more than $100,000 a year. but with trump far ahead of his rivals, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas and ohio governor john kasich, in the race for the presidential nomination, miller said republican voters of all stripes may become more resigned to voting for trump. “i think it is possible he replicates this.” anti establishment trump has historically done well in areas where the collapse of important local industries has put stress on working families   propelling his popularity among poorer white voters drawn to his rhetoric about inept government and failed international trade deals. that narrative persisted in tuesday’s contests. trump took more than 63 percent of the vote in forest county, pennsylvania, where the median family income among whites, at $45,000, is the lowest in the state. but he also got more than 46 percent of the vote in chester county, pennsylvania, where median income for whites is the highest in the state, at $108,000.     a franklin and marshall college voter survey released last week showed trump’s message of disaffection had sunk in across the state. just under 40 percent of voters cited “government, politicians” as the most important problem facing pennsylvania, with “unemployment, personal finances” ranked a distant second at 14 percent. in the affluent maryland suburbs of montgomery and howard counties, where more than 60 percent of whites hold college degrees, trump claimed a smaller 40 percent share of the republican vote. it was still enough for a first place finish over cruz and kasich. fred stubbs, 72, a retired accountant from potomac, maryland, said he voted for trump on tuesday because he believed the real estate mogul would improve the country’s standing in the world. he added that when he traveled to new york, he regularly dined in restaurants in buildings owned by trump. “i’ve always admired him as a businessman,” stubbs said.

" when carissa sellards talks to her west virginia university friends about post graduation plans, one dilemma keeps coming up – whether to stay in their home state or strike out for more promising opportunities elsewhere. if recent history holds, over half of them will either not find work or leave the state, contributing to a brain drain of young talent that is pushing the state to try to reinvent its economy and break with a coal industry in long term decline.  “companies don’t come here to invest because they only associate us with coal,” said sellards, a 20 year old sophomore who addressed the state legislature when she was in high school about the lack of opportunities for young people in a post coal economy. the often stark choices faced by sellards and other young, educated west virginians underline the challenges awaiting democratic candidate hillary clinton here and in other “rust belt” states if she wins the nov. 8 election, as most polls suggest she will. west virginia is expected to vote decisively for republican donald trump, who has gained in recent polls and promises to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work by easing environmental restrictions and renegotiating trade deals to america’s advantage. it is a message that has resonated with millions of older voters in other rust belt states facing declines in manufacturing jobs and feeling threatened by foreign competition.     but it largely rings hollow for college educated millennials like sellards, who are seeking jobs in the service economy or technology sector. by contrast, clinton alienated swathes of west virginia voters by saying earlier this year that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business” in transitioning to cleaner energy. coal industry backers have long accused president barack obama of waging a “war on coal” by imposing tougher environmental standards. clinton later apologized for her comment, and has proposed a $30 billion plan to help revitalize coal communities. the plan promises to secure health benefits for former coal workers, invest in new infrastructure such as broadband access, and repurpose old mines and power plant sites. clinton energy adviser trevor houser has said her challenge will be to help coal and other rust belt communities deal with economic realities rather than “false promises” of restoring dying industries. beneath the nostalgic coal rhetoric, west virginia officials and grassroots groups have quietly started to focus on reversing the flight of college educated millennials to help drive an economic revival.  of the 124,358 students who graduated from public higher education in west virginia in the last decade, 58,730 were working in the state in 2014, a work participation rate of 47.2 percent, according to a report released by west virginia university’s bureau of business and economic research on monday.  the state had the 11th biggest net outflow of college degree holders from 2007 2014, according to the most recent u.s. census.  one barrier to keeping graduates in state is a business start up rate that is the lowest in the country at 5.1 percent in 2014, the most recent year of available data. a reuters analysis of national data shows a strong connection between migration patterns of college graduates and local start up rates: among the 25 states with start up rates below the 2014 median of 6.8 percent, 19 saw a net outflow of college grads between 2007 and 2014. the debate over west virginia’s economic future comes as its coal production this year hit its lowest level since the 1970s.  west virginia’s energy sector, which includes coal, natural gas production and utilities, account for 17 percent of the state’s gdp but only 4 percent of employment. coal industry employment plunged 53 percent between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, down from nearly 26,000 to just over 12,000.  the government is the state’s biggest employer, accounting for 20 percent of jobs, with healthcare a fast growing sector at 17 percent. in 2014, west virginia’s real gdp grew 0.7 percent from the previous year compared to the national average of 2.2 percent.  the state is one of a few whose population shrank over the past two years, according to the latest national census. by median age it is the second oldest u.s. state, four years above the national average.     at the west virginia university institute of technology’s new campus in beckley, which opened in august, close to some of the state’s coal counties, officials hope to turn the struggling city into an innovation hub. in addition to offering courses in burgeoning fields like computer science, sustainable tourism and health care, wvu tech hosts the launch lab, a small business incubator that helps budding entrepreneurs bring ideas to fruition. joe carlucci, a small business coach and director of the launchlab, said west virginia is at the start of a long process of reinvention after decades of mourning coal. “they are prepared to plant that seed and not see the shade of that tree,” he said. “they are seeing that we have to change our own story.” although clinton would struggle to regain popularity in rust belt states if elected, these regions would have an incentive to work with her administration to tap into federal grants. west virginia republican congressman evan jenkins, a member of the house appropriations committee who represents the state’s southern coal producing regions, said the state cannot turn down assistance to diversify its economy. “i want to continue fueling grant making opportunities to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and energy of the state’s millennials,” he told reuters at a ceremony in august in which federal grants were awarded. but unleashing that spirit will require a significant investment in infrastructure, specifically broadband access, something that local lawmakers ignored when coal was still performing well eight years ago, said chris walters, a 30 year old republican state senator.   walters is focused on getting legislation passed to expand broadband access throughout the mountainous state, which ranks near the bottom of the list of broadband connectivity, just ahead of guam and puerto rico. “if we don’t give connectivity to our residents, we aren’t giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global economy,” said walters. in state capital charleston, ngo generation west virginia has helped pass legislation to attract young entrepreneurs seeking low cost alternatives to places like denver or san francisco, including a bill to waive business start up fees to people under 30 and another to allow crowd funding to help seed new businesses. entrepreneurship also extends to industries like agriculture, which state officials see as an opportunity in the state’s rural coal counties. an entrepreneurship program called the coalfield development corporation won a $2 million grant this year to help train young people from coal counties to run businesses, offering them college classes, life skills and paid apprenticeships. ben gilmer, the 34 year old director of the corporation’s agriculture entrepreneurship program refresh appalachia, said part of clinton’s challenge in coal country will be to sell the vision of a future that is unfamiliar. small programs like his can offer concrete examples and help ease the transition, he said. “politicians take advantage of people’s fear of what comes next,” gilmer said. “but five years from now, we will have examples and that will speak louder than any rhetoric that’s out there.”  ",0
" the u.s. senate on tuesday confirmed former justice department lawyer christopher wray as fbi chief, nearly three months after the agency’s previous director, james comey, was fired by president donald trump. wray, who was confirmed by vote of 92 5, will take charge of the country’s top domestic law enforcement agency during a federal probe into allegations of collusion between the trump presidential campaign and russia. since the dismissal of comey on may 9, the justice department has appointed robert mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation with the help of the fbi. russia denies any interference, and trump has denied collusion with russia. wray vowed in his confirmation hearing last month to remain independent and not be swayed by politics or pressure from the president. he also praised muller as the “consummate straight shooter.” he also worked with comey on the government’s case in the enron corp fraud scandal in the early 2000s.  during the confirmation hearing, republican senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley said wray’s background showed he was committed to independence, an attribute he said was “vitally important” in the next fbi director.  wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division at the justice department under former republican president george w. bush.  former attorney general eric holder and former deputy attorney general sally yates, both democrats who served under president barack obama, endorsed wray.

" teachers in peru started returning to classrooms on monday after union leaders announced they should suspend a strike that had sparked unrest and dragged on for more than two months in some places. teachers at public schools in peru had sought a sharper salary hike than the government s 12 percent proposal for next year and opposed evaluation based firings. but union leader pedro castillo announced a temporary end to the strike during the weekend after the government threatened to dismiss teachers who did not return to class. the strike threatened to force 3.5 million school children to repeat the academic year and had sunk president pedro pablo kuczynski s approval rating as teachers blocked roads and clashed with police. the education ministry urged parents to work with teachers to set up schedules to make up for lost time. the government offered to introduce its proposed salary increase to a minimum of 2,000 soles ($618) per month in november instead of next year and said teachers 55 and older could retire early. kuczynski s approval rating dropped 13 percentage points to 19 percent in august, according to a monthly opinion poll by gfk   a new low for the former wall street banker in his year old government.

" u.s. immigration enforcement officers are proposing that fingerprints be taken from all people claiming custody of children who have entered the united states illegally without an adult relative, a measure that opponents said could keep thousands of families apart. as a new wave of unaccompanied central american children pours across the u.s. mexico border, the proposal underscores the sometimes conflicting goals of federal agencies in dealing with undocumented immigrants, a volatile issue on the presidential campaign trail. officials at the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs), which is ultimately responsible for finding housing for migrant children, told reuters they have no plans to change fingerprinting policy. they said the proposal — made by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) officials in an internal memo seen by reuters — would delay family reunions and infringe upon the parent child relationship. “one of our goals is to place children with an appropriate sponsor as promptly as we can safely do so. and so any delay for placing the child with their parent is time that we’re keeping a parent and child separated,” said bobbie gregg, deputy director for children’s services at hhs’s office of refugee resettlement. the memo by ice officials, drafted in response to a february senate hearing, proposes expanding fingerprinting, now limited to non parents, to include parents. ice says that would allow fingerprints to be checked against an fbi database of criminals to verify the identities of people who say they are parents while ensuring that children do not go to parents who have criminal histories. the proposal is preliminary and could change. it was unclear whether it would ultimately win the backing of the white house. department of homeland security (dhs) — which oversees ice — and the justice department advise hhs on its practices and have a role in enforcing overall immigration policy. the white house declined to comment on the proposal. asked about the documents that describe the fingerprinting proposal, a homeland security spokeswoman said the agency does not discuss internal deliberations. neither ice nor hhs would comment on whether they have had discussions on the proposal. from january 2014 to april 2015, more than 31,000 parents claimed children who entered the united states from el salvador, guatemala and honduras, according to a study by the government accountability office (gao), a congressional watchdog unit. they made up 60 percent of those who claimed children, with most of the rest claimed by other relatives. only 161 non relative sponsors claimed children. u.s. authorities are required to find housing for illegal immigrant minors while they await a trial to determine whether they will be deported, a process that can take years. under current law, people who appear at child migrant holding facilities saying they are parents must show the child’s birth certificate to prove the relationship. if that is not available, the parent and child must undergo a dna test. immigration advocates say the ice proposal would discourage parents from sending for their children and claiming them, fearing that ice would use fingerprinting to trace undocumented immigrants for possible deportation. “it could keep parents away from their children if they think it is going to land them in a lock up somewhere,” said david leopold, a cleveland lawyer who formerly headed the american immigration lawyers association. the ice officials also said in the memo that the agency supports expanding immigration status checks to all sponsors, including parents. ice acknowledged that conducting immigration checks on parents claiming children could “reduce the likelihood that sponsors would come forward to take custody of children.” illegal entry into the united states by unaccompanied minors has surged in recent years. most are central american children who make the dangerous journey across mexico and the u.s. border without their parents, fleeing poverty and violence. in the six months through march 2016, almost 28,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended crossing into the united states, close to the record high number hit in the same period in 2014. (graphic on unaccompanied minor crossings and relationships to sponsors: tmsnrt.rs/1nmgqqi) an investigation by the associated press in january found that hhs had placed some migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor for no pay. none of the known abusers had claimed to be parents. a senate panel in february asked authorities to improve screening of adults claiming custody of child migrants.  the document from ice is a draft of answers to questions senate judiciary chairman charles grassley submitted for the record following the hearing. after the ap investigation, hhs said it began doing 30 day follow up checks on households to which it had assigned a child, while also giving an emergency hotline phone number to all children before they are discharged from hhs custody but ice’s response to grassley said hhs should go a step further, noting that many state and local child protective service agencies routinely fingerprint parents who reclaim children after periods of separation.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   a u.s. federal court on tuesday set a march 15 deadline for north carolina state lawmakers to redraw legislative districts found to be racially “gerrymandered,” and ordered a new round of elections by next november for the 28 seats at stake. in august, the same special three judge panel ruled that nine state senate districts and 19 state house districts, as carved out in a plan adopted by the republican controlled legislature in 2011, were unconstitutional. the panel had told north carolina’s legislature to start revamping its political maps immediately, but left the existing boundaries intact for the nov. 8 state elections, because of time constraints. “while special elections have costs, those costs pale in comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens to continue to be represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander,” the panel wrote in its seven page order on tuesday. north carolina has already appealed the august ruling to the u.s. supreme court, which has yet to act. republicans also vowed to appeal tuesday’s ruling, handed down by two u.s. district judges and one circuit judge. the ruling is a “politically motivated” abuse of judicial authority, said state senator bob rucho and representative david lewis, the republican chairmen of the house and senate redistricting committees. if upheld, the court order “is a gross overreach that blatantly disregards the constitutional guarantee for voters to duly elect their legislators to biennial terms,” they said. last year, the southern coalition for social justice challenged north carolina’s latest political maps, saying  legislative district lines were drawn in 2011 so as to dilute the state’s black vote and give republicans an advantage. the three judge panel that heard the case agreed, and tuesday’s order, essentially an extension of its august opinion, was hailed by the north carolina democratic party. a separate three judge u.s. court panel ruled in a similar case a week ago that state assembly districts in wisconsin, as redrawn by its republican led legislature, were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. tuesday’s north carolina ruling sets a deadline of march 15 for newly elected legislators to approve a redistricting plan that passes constitutional muster. it also requires the state to hold special primary and general elections in the late summer and fall of 2017 to fill those 28 house and senate seats. moreover, state lawmakers elected to any of the disputed general assembly seats in 2016 will serve for just one year, instead of the normal two, the court ruled, a limit set for those elected next fall as well.

" president donald trump arrived in hawaii on friday as he set out on the longest trip to asia by an american president in more than a quarter century, looking for help to pressure north korea to stand down from a nuclear crisis. after air force one landed at joint base hickam, trump and his wife, melania, were draped with traditional lei necklaces. trump went on to nearby camp smith for a classified briefing from pacific command military leaders that officials expected would touch on north korea and other areas. later, he was to visit pearl harbor and the uss arizona memorial for the u.s. sailors killed when japan bombed the american naval base on dec. 7, 1941. trump s 12 day trip to japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines, ending on nov. 14, takes him out of washington at a time when he has been beset by several issues. these include an intensifying federal investigation into russian meddling in last year s election, new york s recovery from an attack earlier this week that killed eight people, and debate over a republican tax cut plan that if approved by congress would be trump s first major legislative victory. the trip began just days after trump s former campaign manager paul manafort was indicted in the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and after his attorney general, jeff sessions, faced democratic calls to appear before congress again to clarify his previous testimony about the campaign s russia contacts. amid the furor caused by the revelations, the kremlin said on friday that a meeting between trump and russian president vladimir putin at an asian economic summit next week was being discussed, and trump said it might happen.  we may have a meeting with putin,  trump told fox news.  and, again   putin is very important because they can help us with north korea. they can help us with syria. we have to talk about ukraine.  court documents made public on monday also disclosed that a trump campaign foreign policy adviser, george papadopoulos, pleaded guilty early last month to lying to the federal bureau of investigation. the documents cited a march 2016 meeting, when trump was campaigning for the presidency, and attended by trump and sessions, in which papadopoulos offered to help arrange a meeting between trump and putin. while trump tweeted about developments vigorously this week, he told the new york times on wednesday that he was  not angry at anybody  about the case and there was nothing to suggest any collusion by his campaign and russia. trump s plan for an extended absence from washington has alarmed allies who, after seeing a healthcare reform bid fizzle, worry the tax effort could suffer without trump to keep momentum going. on saturday, trump is to fly to japan and later visit south korea in search of a united front against north korea before going to beijing, where he will push chinese president xi jinping to get tougher with pyongyang. in the fox interview, trump was asked if he planned to be tough on china over thorny issues including trade, intellectual property theft and subsidies.  you have to understand something   very important,  he responded.  we have a problem called north korea.  trump said chinese president xi jinping  has been pretty terrific  in cutting pyongyang off from banking and oil systems. he added that japan had reason to be worried about north korea and alluded to japanese prime minister shinzo abe s campaign for a military buildup against that threat.  well, you know japan is a warrior nation,  he said.  i tell china and i tell everyone else that, listen, you re going to have yourself a big problem with japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with north korea.  trump will attend the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in danang, vietnam, make a state visit to hanoi and end his trip with the association of south east asia nations summit in manila. trump told reporters before leaving on friday that he would spend an extra day in the philippines. the last time a u.s. president was in asia for so long was in late 1991 and early 1992, when president george h.w. bush became ill at a japanese state dinner.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on monday expressed concern about “credible reports” of russian interference in the u.s. election and accused donald trump of being fixated on dictators including russia’s vladimir putin. taking questions from reporters for more than 20 minutes on her campaign plane, clinton said both democrats and republicans should be concerned about russia’s behavior. “the fact that our intelligence professionals are now studying this and taking it seriously raises some grave questions about potential russian interference with our electoral process,” clinton said. “we are facing a very serious concern. we’ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ... we’ve never had the nominee of one of our major parties urging the russians to hack more,” she said. trump, the republican nominee, has praised putin, the president of russia, and has called on moscow to dig up tens of thousands of “missing” emails from clinton’s time as head of the u.s. state department. he later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic. clinton has previously tied russian intelligence services to the cyber hack on the democratic national committee.  asked on monday if she believed the russian government was trying to help elect her opponent, clinton paused. “i often quote a great saying that i learned from living in arkansas for many years: if you find a turtle on a fencepost it didn’t get there by itself,” she said. “i think it’s quite intriguing that this activity has happened around the time trump became the nominee.” clinton, a former secretary of state and a former first lady, has drawn criticism for not holding regular press conferences. on monday she took questions on an array of topics for more than 20 minutes. clinton dismissed concerns about her health as one of many conspiracy theories that were lobbed against her. she blamed seasonal allergies for a sustained coughing fit at an earlier event in ohio. during the question and answer session on her plane, she also had to step away because of persistent coughing. clinton, whose use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has dogged her 2016  presidential campaign, said she understood and took classification seriously when she was president barack obama’s top diplomat. clinton said that the attacks on her family’s foundation were not rooted in fact and sidestepped a question on whether her daughter, chelsea, should step down from the foundation’s leadership if she is elected in november.

" the white house on saturday accused the media of framing photographs to understate the crowd that attended donald trump’s inauguration, a new jab in a long running fight between the new president and the news organizations who cover him. in an unusual and fiery statement on saturday night, white house spokesman sean spicer lashed out about tweeted photographs that showed large, empty spaces on the national mall during the ceremony on friday. “this was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. both in person and around the globe,” spicer said in a brief statement. “these attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong.” washington’s city government estimated 1.8 million people attended president barack obama’s 2009 inauguration, making it the largest gathering ever on the mall.  aerial photographs showed that the crowds for trump’s inauguration were smaller than in 2009.   spicer’s rebuke followed a larger than expected turnout for women’s marches protesting trump across the united states on saturday, including at the flagship event in washington, where a crowd of hundreds of thousands clogged the streets and appeared to be larger than those who came for trump’s inauguration. spicer, who did not take questions from reporters, said spaces for 720,000 people were full when trump took his oath.  he also said the national park service does not put out official crowd counts. “no one had numbers.” washington’s metro subway system said 193,000 users had entered the system by 11 a.m. on friday, compared with 513,000 at that time during obama’s 2009 inauguration. on saturday, metro reported ridership of 275,000 at 11 a.m. as it struggled to handle the crowd converging on downtown washington for the protest march. trump has long used the media as a foil during his unconventional climb to the white house. on saturday, he blamed the media for making up his feud with the cia over its investigation into russian hacking. spicer also criticized a reporter who made an error in a pool report during a brief ceremony in the oval office on friday. earlier, trump called out the reporter by name at the cia headquarters. “there’s been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold donald trump accountable, and i’m here to tell you it goes two ways. we’re going to hold the press accountable as well,” spicer said.

" veteran farc leader rodrigo londono   known as  timochenko    will run for the presidency of colombia next year, with the backing of former farc rebels, the group s new political party said on wednesday. however, he and other ex commanders will likely face trials for human rights crimes and it is unclear how they would serve in office if sentenced.  the marxist farc demobilized under a peace deal with the government last year, ending more than five decades of war. they are now the revolutionary alternative common force party, still referring to themselves by the spanish initials farc. the party is guaranteed 10 seats in congress through 2026 by the accord, regardless of its success in elections. among senate candidates will be former guerrilla commanders ivan marquez, pablo catatumbo, carlos antonio lozada and victoria sandino, the farc said on wednesday. the party will also run candidates for the lower house in five districts. the group reiterated its willingness to forming a coalition with other leftist parties, a tacit acknowledgement it may have little electoral pull among skeptical colombians.  we manifest our willingness to hold talks with all social political groups and movements to make united lists,  the farc said in a statement. londono, best known by his war alias timochenko, suffered a stroke this year and has received treatment in cuba. it remains unclear how the farc members would complete their terms if they are tried or sentenced by transitional justice tribunals tasked with bringing former rebels to justice for crimes like murder, kidnapping and rape. the maximum sentence the tribunals can hand out is eight years and those convicted will avoid traditional jails, instead doing reparations work like removing land mines. in a wednesday press conference, the farc leaders did not clarify how they would serve possible sentences while holding elected positions. more than 11,000 farc fighters and supporters handed over their weapons to the united nations during demobilization.  another 1,000 refused to lay down their arms and continue to operate lucrative drug trafficking and illegal mining operations. the farc has sought to distance itself from the dissidents and the government has authorized air raids against them. there is a crowded field for 2018 s presidential race, which looks set to focus more on issues like the economy and corruption than on implementation of the deal, the cornerstone of current president juan manuel santos  legacy. security does however remain on the minds of many voters, especially after farmers were killed in a confrontation with police last month.

" members of the house judiciary committee are considering filing a “friend of the court” brief in apple inc’s [aapl.o] encryption dispute with the u.s. government to argue that the case should be decided by congress and not the courts, five sources familiar with the matter said. the sources cautioned that no final agreement had been reached on what would be an unusual intervention by congressmen in a legal proceeding. any filing would occur after a panel hearing on tuesday that will include fbi director james comey and apple general counsel bruce sewell. the court deadline is thursday. the filing would argue that the feb. 16 order from a federal court in california that instructs apple to write special software to unlock an iphone 5c used by one of the san bernardino shooters threatens the constitutional separation of powers, the sources said. they said the brief would come from individual committee members of both republican and democratic parties but not the judiciary committee itself. reuters could not determine which members were likely to be included. lawmakers could wait until the appeals process before intervening, the sources said. apple last week formally opposed the order in court, calling the case “unprecedented” and a violation of free speech rights that would override the will of congress. on monday, a judge in a related new york case sided with apple in agreeing that the courts did not have the authority to order apple to unlock a phone.  the san bernardino case has come to represent a broader debate over how much authority law enforcement should have to compel companies to assist in monitoring digital communications.    the encryption debate does not divide along party lines, with liberal democrats and libertarian leaning republicans both supporting apple’s stance. many pro law enforcement lawmakers of both parties, and republican presidential front runner donald trump, support the government’s position. the unusual congressional intervention would come on top of a wave of support for apple among its silicon valley brethren. some two dozen companies and civil liberties groups are expected to weigh in on apple’s side. relatives of some of the shooting victims are planning to back the government’s case, said their lawyer, stephen larson.  the federal bureau of investigation earlier this month sought and obtained a court order requiring that apple write new software and take other steps to unlock an iphone 5c that was used by rizwan farook, who along with his wife went on a shooting rampage on dec. 2 in san bernardino that killed 14 and wounded 22.  the government has said the attack was inspired by islamist militants and the fbi wants to read data from the phone to investigate any links the couple might have had with militant groups. apple is concerned that the order would lead to endless similar requests in the u.s. and overseas and ultimately undermine the security of all apple phone. a number of large tech firms have publicly said they will file briefs supporting apple. google, facebook and microsoft are expected to file jointly and be represented by neal katyal, a georgetown law professor and former acting u.s. solicitor general for the obama administration, according to a source familiar with the companies’ plans. amazon, linkedin, twitter, the mozilla foundation, and the cloud storage firm box, along with advocacy groups including the electronic frontier foundation and the center for democracy and technology, are also expected to support apple.  still, some major companies, including ibm, are expected to sit out the fight. telecom carriers have also been notably reluctant to get involved; verizon is unlikely to file a friend of the court brief, despite comments from its ceo that the company supports encryption with no backdoors, sources familiar with the matter said.  a justice department spokeswoman declined comment on sunday about what other briefs were expected.   apple’s high profile standoff with the u.s. government is being played out as many of the obama administration’s most senior officials are traveling to san francisco this week to attend the world’s largest cyber security conference.  u.s. attorney general loretta lynch, national security director michael rogers and defense secretary ash carter are all scheduled to speak at rsa conference, where the iphone fight and encryption more broadly are expected to dominate conversation.

" a franco german program to develop a european fighter jet will likely be widened to include other countries to lower costs, officials with the german defense ministry and europe s airbus said on wednesday. france and germany unveiled the plans in july, burying past rivalries as part of a raft of measures to tighten defense and security cooperation. companies in britain, italy and sweden have expressed interest in participating in the multi billion euro program, that is widely expected to be led by airbus and france s dassault aviation. bertram gorlo, airbus defence and space s head of key account management for germany, austria and switzerland, told a panel at the berlin security conference that details were still being worked out, but he expected the program to be expanded to include more partners than just germany and france.  i think ... we will have to ask for the support of other nations,  he said. france and germany aim to come up with a roadmap by mid 2018 for jointly leading development of the new aircraft to replace their existing fleets of warplanes. brigadier general gerald funke, head of the strategic defense planning and concepts division at the german defense ministry, said development of the next generation aircraft system would likely begin the 2020s with the goal of seeing it enter into service in 2045. in the meantime, he said germany was looking at buying an existing aircraft to replace its aging fleet of 85 tornado jets beginning in 2025. funke said it would be tough to avoid the national rivalries over jobs and other considerations that plagued earlier international programs like the a400m military transport plane.   in europe, we re in a world where we still have national interests, industrial interests. and the more partners you have the more complicated it is,  he said.   on the other hand, i m also fully convinced that we will not be able to afford a national solution alone. the key is the will of the partners to cooperate and to find compromise.  gorlo told the panel that airbus successfully coordinated with many partners on each of its commercial airliners.  the question is less about the number of partners, it s more about the governance model under which we contract,  gorlo said. he said the german defense ministry had already expressed interest in setting up a  lead nation  or  lead industry  concept for the new fighter program, which could help ensure a more efficient and streamlined development process.

" u.s. president donald trump on thursday said he would be willing to step in and mediate the worst dispute in decades among the u.s. allied arab states and qatar, and said he thinks a deal could come quickly.  if i can help mediate between qatar and, in particular, the uae and saudi arabia, i would be willing to do so, and i think you would have a deal worked out very quickly,  trump said at a joint news conference with kuwaiti emir sheikh sabah al ahmad al jaber al sabah. saudi arabia, the uae, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest u.s. military base. the nations say doha supports regional foe iran and islamists, charges qatar s leaders deny. kuwait has been trying to mediate the dispute.  what is important is that we have stopped any military action,  sheikh sabah said. while both sides in the dispute have ruled out the use of armed force, some ordinary qataris have said they worry about the possibility of military action, given the ferocity of the criticism their country has received from media in the four arab states. sheikh sabah said he had received a letter from qatar that expressed willingness to discuss a list of 13 demands from its neighbors.  we know that not all of these 13 demands are acceptable,  sheikh sabah said, referring specifically to issues that affected qatari sovereignty.  a great part of them will be resolved,  he said. for its part, doha said trump had called emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani to discuss mediation efforts. qatari foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani told al jazeera tv that any mediation had to come  without conditions , reiterating that doha would not negotiate while transport links with neighbors remained cut. the arab powers responded with a joint statement accusing qatar of putting preconditions on negotiations which it said showed a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute. the four countries reiterated an accusation that qatar continued to finance terrorism and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble doha s sovereignty. at the same time, they have said qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to  any legitimate issues  of concern to fellow gulf cooperation council member states. the joint statement praised what the countries called trump s firm assertion that the only way to resolve the crisis was by stopping the support and financing of terrorism  and his unwillingness to resolve the crisis unless this is achieved . they expressed regret about the kuwaiti emir s comment about stopping military intervention.  the military option was not and will not be (used) in any circumstance,  the statement said.

" a federal appeals court on monday revived a lawsuit by prospective gun shop owners who were banned by alameda county, california, from opening within 500 feet of a residential district, ruling that local officials had failed to justify their law in the face of a constitutional right to bear arms. a three member panel of the ninth u.s. circuit court of appeals did not strike down the local ordinance, but voted 2 1 to overturn a federal judge who threw the gun store owners’ lawsuit out of court. gun rights groups quickly hailed the decision as an important protection of the second amendment. “we’re very happy to see the court take a very principled and reasoned approach to protecting the fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms,” brandon combs, executive director of the calguns foundation, said in a written statement.  the ninth circuit panel ordered that judge to take up the case again and said that if alameda county wanted to enforce the gun control ordinance, officials there would have to prove that there was a basis for the restrictions. “alameda county’s ordinance may very well be permissible. thus far, however, the county has failed to justify the burden it has placed on the right of law abiding citizens to purchase guns,” judge diarmuid o’scannlain wrote in a 34 page opinion for the majority.  “the second amendment (of the u.s. constitution) requires something more rigorous than the unsubstantiated assertions offered to the district court,” o’scannlain wrote. representatives for the alameda county board of supervisors could not immediately be reached for comment. in tossing the lawsuit out of court, the lower court judge found that alameda county’s gun restrictions were permissible to achieve such “important governmental objectives” as protecting public safety, preserving the character of residential areas and guarding against “secondary effects” of gun stores. but the ninth circuit majority said that alameda county had not provided any evidence that such objectives would be achieved. the plaintiffs also asserted that no parcels in alameda county would fit within the regulations, which meant that gun sales were effectively banned there. in dissenting from the majority, judge barry silverman said that the ordinance did not infringe upon anyone’s right to bear arms and that “what we’re dealing with here is a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a second amendment challenge.”     ",0
" civilians caught up in the battle for the syrian city of raqqa are paying an  unacceptable price  and attacking forces may be contravening international law with their intense air strikes, the top united nations human rights official said on thursday. a u.s. led coalition is seeking to oust islamic state from raqqa, while syrian government forces, backed by the russian air force and iran backed militias are also advancing on the city. some 20,000 civilians are trapped in raqqa where the jihadist fighters are holding some of them as human shields, the world body says. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said that his office had documented 151 civilian deaths in six incidents alone in august, due to air strikes and ground based attacks.  given the extremely high number of reports of civilian casualties this month and the intensity of the air strikes on raqqa, coupled with isil s use of civilians as human shields, i am deeply concerned that civilians   who should be protected at all times   are paying an unacceptable price and that forces involved in battling isil are losing sight of the ultimate goal of this battle,  zeid said in a statement.   ...the attacking forces may be failing to abide by the international humanitarian law principles of precautions, distinction, and proportionality,  he said.  the u.s. led coalition has said it conducted nearly 1,100 air strikes on and near raqqa this month, up from 645 in july, the u.n. statement said. russia s air force has reported carrying out 2,518 air strikes across syria in the first three weeks of august, it added.  meanwhile isil fighters continue to prevent civilians from fleeing the area, although some manage to leave after paying large amounts of money to smugglers,  zeid said. we have reports of smugglers also being publicly executed by isil.  u.s. led warplanes on wednesday blocked a convoy of islamic state fighters and their families from reaching territory the group holds in eastern syria and struck some of their comrades traveling to meet them, a coalition spokesman said.

" several prominent saudi clerics have been detained in an apparent crackdown on potential opponents of the conservative kingdom s absolute rulers amid widespread speculation that king salman intends to abdicate in favor of his son. saudi sources told reuters that salman al awdah, awad al qarni and ali al omary were detained over the weekend. officials could not be reached or declined to comment. all three are outside the state backed clerical establishment but have large online followings. they have previously criticised the government but more recently kept silent or failed to publicly back saudi policies, including the rift with qatar over supporting the muslim brotherhood. awdah was imprisoned from 1994 99 for agitating for political change and leadership of the brotherhood inspired sahwa (awakening) movement. he later called for democracy and tolerance during the  arab spring  uprisings of 2011. saudi officials have dismissed reports that the king may soon pass the throne to crown prince mohammed bin salman, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. but the al saud family has always regarded islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. in the 1990s, the sahwa demanded political reforms that would have weakened the ruling family.  mohammed bin salman is very likely to be the next king but any dissenting voices that could challenge this succession could also be considered destabilizing from the regime perspective,  said jean marc rickli, head of global risk at the geneva centre for security policy.  you put that in the context of the qatar rift and it is very difficult right now in the gulf to have an opinion that is not considered biased or adversarial because the situation is so polarized on all sides.  saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, bahrain and egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with qatar in june over its alleged support for islamist militants, a charge doha denies. in the past two years, crown prince mohammed has launched radical reforms to foster economic diversity and cultural openness, testing the kingdom s traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus. resistance has not been met kindly, with the authorities increasingly silencing independent actors, said stephane lacroix, a scholar of islam in saudi arabia.  it s a much broader attempt to crush islamists regardless of whether they act in opposition or not,  he said.  this (the arrests) would be [prince mohammed] and the regime trying to impose a much stricter political order.  the crackdown is not limited to islamists. civil liberties monitors say freedom of expression is increasingly constrained in gulf arab states including saudi arabia.  there is a general climate of being hypersensitive and almost paranoid,  said madawi al rasheed, visiting professor at the middle east centre, london school of economics.  there is no room for any kind of dissent at the moment.  the government toughened its stance following the arab spring after it averted unrest by increasing salaries and other state spending but the brotherhood gained power elsewhere in the region. the group represents an ideological threat to riyadh s dynastic system of rule, and its use of oaths of allegiance and secret meetings are anathema to the saudis. it was listed by riyadh as a terrorist organization in 2014 and diplomats and analysts say there is little prospect that would change. taking power in january 2015, king salman initially appeared willing to allow the brotherhood a role outside politics, for example by not stopping affiliated preachers such as awdah from speaking publicly on religious or social issues. that appears to have changed in recent months, as a shift in the official discourse targeted islamists and arrests increased, said lacroix.  what happened a couple of days ago is an acceleration of the process,  he said, although it is unclear what specifically prompted the detentions. awdah tweeted on friday welcoming a report that suggested the row between qatar and other arab countries may be resolved.  may god harmonize their hearts for the good of their people,  he wrote after a telephone call between crown prince mohammed and qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani. awdah comes from buraidah, heartland of the kingdom s ultra conservative wahhabi school of islam. criticism of the ruling family in the 1990s earned him praise from osama bin laden, whom he eventually denounced. his sahwa movement was later undermined by a mixture of repression and co optation.  some clerics, however, maintained large followings through youtube sermons. awdah has 14 million twitter followers. he supported resistance to u.s. forces in iraq as  jihad , or holy war, but then emerged as an ally in the government s campaign against violent jihadists. in 2011, awdah called for elections and separation of powers, principles antithetical to strict islamist ideology. he has since been largely quiet on issues of domestic reform. qarni, who was detained at home in abha in saudi arabia s south, had also expressed support for reconciliation with qatar, hopes for which were quickly dashed when saudi arabia ended any dialogue with qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts .  it seems today in saudi arabia that not supporting openly and enthusiastically what is happening against qatar basically makes you an agent of qatar,  said lacroix.  people who don t take a stance stand in the middle, and there s no middle ground for the saudis now.

" nigeria s armed forces said on friday a group campaigning for the secession of a part of southeastern nigeria formerly known as biafra had been categorized as a  terrorist organization . the move follows days of tension in which members of the group accused the army of laying siege to their leader s home, which the army denied. a curfew was imposed in abia state where the residence is located.  the indigenous people of biafra (ipob) group has stepped up calls for secession since its leader, nnamdi kanu, was released on bail in april after being detained nearly two years on charges of criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society. secessionist sentiment has simmered in the region since the biafra separatist rebellion plunged africa s most populous country into a civil war in 1967 70 that killed an estimated one million people. the military presence in southeastern nigeria has increased in the last few weeks as part of an operation that the military said was part of efforts to crack down on crime.  the armed forces of nigeria wishes to confirm to the general public that ipob from all intent, plan and purpose as analyzed, is a militant terrorist organization,  said armed forces spokesman john enenche in an emailed statement.  the statement said ipob had formed a  biafra secret service  a paramilitary division, extorted money from people on public roads and attacked members of the armed forces.  an ipob spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  the tension is another security challenge for president muhammadu buhari in addition to the eight year boko haram jihadist insurgency in the northeast and attempts to maintain a fragile ceasefire in the southern niger delta energy hub. militant attacks on oil facilities in the niger delta last year cut crude production by more than a third. renewed calls for biafran secession prompted buhari to use his first speech after returning from three months of medical leave in britain in august to say nigeria s unity was  not negotiable .  amid mounting tensions in the region, the army on thursday said it was investigating video footage circulating on social media that purportedly showed troops at a checkpoint in abia  using sticks to flog men stripped to the waist and forcing them to drink muddy water. amnesty international in 2016 accused nigeria s security forces of killing at least 150 biafra separatists at peaceful rallies. the military and police denied the allegations.

" mexico’s president has said his country will not pay for white house hopeful donald trump’s proposed wall along the u.s. mexico border, and likened his “strident tone” to the ascent of dictators like adolf hitler and benito mussolini.  president enrique pena nieto’s comments, published in monday’s excelsior newspaper, were among the most critical public comments yet by a foreign leader of the new york billionaire.  read more: diplomats sound alarm bells over 'president trump' trump, front runner to win the republican party presidential nomination for the nov. 8 election, has sparked outrage in mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern u.s. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make mexico pay for it.  asked by excelsior whether there was a “scenario” under which mexico would pay if trump won the presidency, pena nieto was clear. “there is no scenario,” he said. “i have to say that i regret (the plan), and of course, i can’t agree with this american politician’s position.”  trump, who has also aroused concern among many in his own party with his proposals, has accused mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the border and vowed to increase fees on some mexican visas and all border crossing cards to help make mexico pay for the wall.  pena nieto attacked the “populism” of the trump campaign, which he said sought to put forward “very easy, simple solutions to problems that are obviously not that easy to solve.”  “and there have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity,” the mexican president added.  “that’s how mussolini got in, that’s how hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.  “and i think what (they) put forward ended up at what we know today from history, in global conflagration. we don’t want that happening anywhere in the world,” pena nieto said.  mexican finance minister luis videgaray called trump’s wall a “terrible” idea in an interview last week, while former mexican presidents felipe calderon and vicente fox have both compared trump to hitler.  in spite of his comments, pena nieto stressed that his administration will seek to reach agreement and maintain a respectful relationship with whoever wins the u.s. presidency.  foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to u.s. government officials about what they say are trump’s inflammatory and insulting public statements.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   republican presidential candidate donald trump sided on thursday with those criticizing a controversial new north carolina law requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. trump said the law was unnecessary and people should be allowed to use whichever bathroom feels appropriate. “leave it the way it is,” he said during a town hall on nbc’s today show. “there have been very few complaints the way it is,” added trump, who is front runner to be the republican presidential nominee in november’s election. national basketball association commissioner adam silver also on thursday made his strongest statements yet suggesting that the league’s 2017 all star game would be moved out of the state if the law is not changed, the washington post reported. at a meeting with associated press sports editors, silver maintained that there was no deadline for making a decision about the event to be held in charlotte, north carolina. corporations, entertainers and activists are calling for a repeal of the measure signed into law last month by the state’s republican governor, pat mccrory.  state tourism and business groups say tens of millions of dollars in revenue have been lost as meetings have relocated, and entertainers including bruce springsteen canceled concerts. paypal holdings (pypl.o) and deutsche bank (dbkgn.de) halted or canceled plans to add jobs in protest at the law. “north carolina did something (that) was very strong, and they’re paying a big price,” trump said. trump’s main rival for the republican nomination, u.s. senator ted cruz, reiterated his support for north carolina’s law, which invalidated an ordinance passed in charlotte and is now the subject of a federal lawsuit. [l2n1700nv] “we shouldn’t be facilitating putting little girls alone in a bathroom w/ grown men,” cruz, who is a social conservative and  the father of two young girls, said on twitter. “that’s just a bad, bad, bad idea.” north carolina’s law has been criticized for denying protections to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community beyond bathroom access. mccrory has signaled a willingness to revise some aspects of the measure, but he and other top republicans in the state are standing firm on the controversial bathroom provision. mccrory is seeking re election in november. his campaign has defended the provision saying it affects only bathrooms in public schools and government buildings, and private businesses are free to adopt their own bathroom policies.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson asked saudi arabia to ease its blockade of yemen, two sources said, just days before the saudi led military coalition announced on wednesday it would let aid flow through the yemeni port of hodeidah and allow u.n. flights to the capital.  it was not clear if pressure from washington was the direct cause of the saudi change of heart but the request from tillerson to saudi arabia s crown prince, mohammed bin salman, was one of several u.s. attempts this month to have riyadh soften its hawkish foreign policy.  tillerson asked for a loosening of the blockade on yemen during a roughly 45 minute phone call at the beginning of this week, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. r.c. hammond, a top adviser to tillerson, confirmed the exchange with prince mohammed. the secretary of state  has brought the request to (the) saudis  attention several times over the past months,  he added.      the trump administration, according to u.s. officials and a european diplomat, also pressed the saudis to allow lebanese prime minister saad al hariri to return to beirut after he flew to riyadh on nov.4 and abruptly announced his resignation. the efforts to take the edge off saudi arabia s foreign policy reflect growing u.s. concern about riyadh s direction despite high profile attempts by president donald trump to improve relations with the longtime u.s. ally.              publicly, trump, his top aides and senior saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in u.s. saudi ties compared with relations under former president barack obama, who upset the saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch foe iran. privately, however, u.s. diplomats and intelligence analysts   express growing dismay over riyadh s foreign policy, especially toward yemen and lebanon, as saudi arabia aims to contain iranian influence.      it is my understanding that the administration is frustrated. there has been of course varying degrees of frustration from different members of the administration,  u.s. senator todd young said of the situation in yemen.  young, a republican member of the senate foreign relations committee, spoke before the saudi led military coalition s decision was announced on wednesday.         the coalition, which is fighting houthi rebels, said it would allow humanitarian aid access through hodeidah and u. n. flights to the capital sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country to stop the flow of arms from iran. yemen, in civil war and under bombardment by a saudi led coalition, faces a deep humanitarian crisis and aid workers warn of famine if the blockade were not lifted.                   a senior saudi official told reuters that even before tillerson and prince mohammed spoke recently, senior white house officials had communicated to the saudi ambassador in washington the importance of taking those two steps.  they stressed the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in yemen and we said that we understood and that the closures were temporary while we work on a comprehensive aid and access plan,  the official said. an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that white house and national security council officials worked on easing the blockade with senior saudi officials, including prince mohammed and his younger brother khalid, the saudi ambassador to the united states.    much of the u.s. saudi relationship, multiple u.s. officials say, is conducted in a tight circle and led by trump s son in law and senior adviser, jared kushner, who has established a direct channel with prince mohammed. kushner  did not oppose  the pressure on the saudis and united arab emirates to ease humanitarian suffering in yemen, said one u.s. official. but the official added:  in no way does this change the position that jared and the crown prince evidently share that the main objective is reversing iranian influence in yemen and elsewhere.         on lebanon, the u.s. message to saudi arabia about hariri was conveyed in statements by tillerson and in private conversations between u.s. and saudi officials. those officials included the saudi state minister for gulf affairs, thamer al sabhan, who was in washington recently, a senior administration official said.  we ve encouraged...the saudis that it will be good for lebanon s political stability for hariri to return back to beirut as soon as is practical,  the official said last week.     hariri has since returned to lebanon and shelved his decision to resign as prime minister, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the middle east. top lebanese officials have said saudi arabia forced hariri to quit and held him in the kingdom. riyadh and hariri deny this.

" president donald trump and congressional republicans, fresh from their failed push to repeal obamacare, are now tackling a project that has eluded washington for 30 years   tax reform. tax staffers are meeting in the house of representatives and the senate through the august break to work on legislation that is expected to be unveiled next month. some analysts are skeptical that the fractious republicans are up to comprehensive tax reform, even though the party controls both chambers, and say republican may have to settle for a handful of tax cuts. here are some of the key tax issues ahead. americans pay a top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent. trump wants to cut that top rate to 35 percent; house republican leaders have proposed cutting it to 33 percent. in proposals to simplify taxes, trump wants to shrink the number of tax brackets to three from seven and double the standard deduction, a set level of income exempt from tax. the latter move, analysts say, would sharply reduce the number of taxpayers who can claim certain narrower deductions, such as the ones for mortgage interest and charitable donations. trump has also promised, without providing much detail, more help for families with child and dependent care expenses and to eliminate targeted tax breaks that benefit wealthy people. in two proposals that would help mainly high income and wealthy taxpayers, trump and congressional republicans want to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. the estate tax, which republicans call the “death tax,” is a tax on the assets left to heirs by people when they die. it is paid by very few americans because it currently applies only to inheritances exceeding $5.49 million per person. the alternative minimum tax is a way to make sure that mostly high earners who have many deductions pay some taxes. an effort by trump and congressional republicans to repeal former president barack obama’s affordable care act and the taxes that support it failed in july. those taxes, including a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income and a 0.9 percent payroll tax to support the medicare healthcare program for the elderly, remain on the books for now.  americans can deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from their federal tax bills. trump and house republican leaders want to end this. the proposal would most hurt states where democrats dominate because those states tend to charge higher state and local taxes and provide more government services, with the result that their residents take larger federal deductions. but the proposal is opposed by at least 20 house republicans, reducing its chances of enactment. tax deductions for interest paid on mortgages and donations to charities are probably safe. trump has promised to protect them. yet, there has been discussion of lowering the cap on the mortgage interest deduction to $500,000 from $1 million. analysts say that would generate enough revenue to cut the corporate tax rate by three percentage points, but such a move would pit upper middle class and wealthy homeowners against multinational corporations.   lobbyists for real estate businesses and philanthropies say  that, if the standard deduction doubled, fewer taxpayers would be able to claim the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions. that could undermine home buying and donations to philanthropies, they say. corporations pay 35 percent of their profits in taxes, at least on paper. trump wants to slash that to 15 percent; house republicans want 20 percent; some lawmakers say 25 percent might be achievable. no consensus on the rate has been reached. pass through businesses trump wants a special, low tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which are private companies that pass their profits through to owners as income that is taxed at the individual rate. most u.s. businesses are pass throughs and range from family run shops to large businesses. the idea of a special tax rate for them raises the prospect of a new wave of tax avoidance schemes with wage earners funneling income into “pass through” structures. under republicans’ plans, about $2.6 trillion in corporate profits now parked abroad would be repatriated, or brought into the united states, and taxed at 3.5 percent to 8.75 percent payable over eight years. that rate would be way below the 35 percent tax that is owed now on those profits, but that is payable only if they enter the country. republicans also want to change the corporate income tax so companies are no longer taxed on foreign profits by adopting a so called “territorial” system, replacing the “worldwide” system in which u.s. companies are taxed on profits globally. the u.s. tax code allows corporations to defer tax payments on foreign profits held overseas. corporations have been stockpiling profits abroad to avoid paying the 35 percent u.s. corporate rate, which under current law they would owe when the money is returned to u.s. soil. a house republican “border adjustment” tax proposal meant to discourage imports and encourage exports has been dropped. tax cuts generally reduce federal revenue and raise the budget deficit. the deficit is estimated in fiscal 2017 to hit $693 billion, or 3.6 percent of u.s. gross domestic product (gdp), up from 3.1 percent in 2016. with that in mind, republican deficit hawks could make it hard for trump to push through any deficit expanding tax measures. some republicans want congress’s nonpartisan, professional tax and budget analysts to make more use of “dynamic scoring” in estimating the impact of tax changes on the budget. the approach tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts, resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that the senate would have a final vote on april 7 on president donald trump’s nominee for the supreme court, neil gorsuch, even as more democrats opposed his confirmation the gorsuch nomination, mcconnell told reporters, will hit the senate floor next week after the senate judiciary committee on monday approves him. mcconnell added that gorsuch will be “confirmed on friday” of next week. senate republicans continued to put the pressure on democrats to lend enough support to colorado appeals court judge gorsuch to avoid a showdown that in turn could trigger mcconnell to seek a change in senate rules that would clear away a democratic blockade against the nomination. so far, about 26 of the 48 democratic senators have publicly announced opposition to gorsuch. most of that group backs a growing effort to block a confirmation vote through the use of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster. sixty votes in the 100 seat senate would be needed to stop a filibuster and allow a confirmation vote on gorsuch. the confirmation would require a simple majority in favor. republicans control the senate 52 48. some senate republican aides suggested that if democrats block a confirmation vote, mcconnell might move quickly to change the rules. it was unclear, however, if he had enough votes to do so democratic senate leader chuck schumer told reporters that gorsuch will face an uphill climb to get the 60 votes he would need to avoid a showdown over senate rules. “the bottom line is very simple, and that is that gorsuch did not acquit himself well at the hearings and did not impress our caucus,” schumer said, accusing gorsuch of siding with  powerful interests and expressing concerns about his independence from the president. “it’s going to be a real uphill climb for him to get those 60 votes,” schumer told reporters. trump is seeking to avoid another setback in congress after major healthcare legislation he supported was pulled from the house of representatives floor amid opposition within his own party on friday.  the confirmation of gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine seat court’s conservative majority, a major campaign promise for trump. the senate judiciary committee oversaw a four day confirmation hearing for gorsuch last week.

" discord emerged between japan and canada over progress on the trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade deal on thursday, as japan said countries  agree in principle  on a way forward, but canada said there was no such agreement. the spat highlighted the continuing challenge to reviving a pact whose survival was thrown into doubt when president donald trump ditched it, in one of his first acts in office, in favor of bilateral dealmaking. japan had lobbied hard to proceed with a pact that could also help to contain china s growing regional dominance, ahead of talks in the vietnamese resort of danang this week alongside asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) meetings. some other members have not shown a readiness to move so fast. asked by reporters about the results of a meeting of tpp ministers, japanese economy minister toshimitsu motegi said  (they) agree in principle , adding that the ministers had finalised  a list of suspensions    clauses that would be suspended to avoid renegotiating the whole agreement. but candian trade minister francois philippe champagne later said on twitter:  despite reports, there is no agreement in principle on tpp.  the tpp aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across a bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion last year. it also has provisions for protecting everything from labor rights to the environment to intellectual property   one of the main sticking points. canada, whose economy is the second biggest among the tpp 11 after japan, said on wednesday it would not be rushed into a revived tpp deal. like mexico, its position is further complicated by renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement (nafta) with the trump administration. mexico s trade minister said on thursday the tpp countries had reached agreement in talks, but he gave no details and said there would be an announcement on friday. the leaders of tpp countries are tentatively scheduled to meet on friday to discuss the proposals of ministers. one canadian official who declined to be named said ministers from different countries may have had different interpretations of thursday s discussions. options discussed by the tpp countries have included suspending some provisions of the original agreement to avoid having to renegotiate it and potentially to entice the united states back in the long term. trump and other apec leaders, including president xi jinping of china and russian president vladimir putin, will meet on friday in danang. apec trade and foreign ministers separately ended a meeting on thursday with a  very good outcome , despite differing views on trade and protectionism, vietnamese trade minister tran tuan anh said.  ministerial talks on a communique for the apec leaders were extended into a second day on thursday in the face of u.s. demands for changes to the language used concerning issues such as free trade and protectionism, officials at the talks said.

" brazilian president michel temer’s government introduced to congress on tuesday a landmark constitutional amendment to cap public spending, seeking to press ahead with unpopular reforms in the wake of last weekend’s municipal elections. temer’s new center right government hopes the proposal, which would limit growth in spending to the rate of inflation for up to 20 years, will clear a congressional committee this week and be put to a vote in the lower house by next week. the amendment is designed to curb a budget deficit equivalent to 10 percent of gross domestic product last year. hopes for its passage have made brazilian assets among the best performing in the world this year despite an economy submerged in a two year recession. in a concession to ease its passage, the government announced on monday that a cap on health and education expenditure would not go into effect until 2018, rather than next year. leftist opponents have demanded more time to debate a measure they say violates the spirit of brazil’s 1988 constitution, which made generous provisions for social spending. they plan to seek a court injunction to block the amendment. backers warn that latin america’s largest nation, which is wrestling with a sprawling corruption scandal, could follow greece’s path to financial meltdown if spending is not controlled. temer said on monday that public debt, which ended last year at a level equivalent to two thirds of economic output, would reach 100 percent of gdp by 2024 without the measure. “if this change is not adopted, fiscal collapse and the  insolvency of public accounts are inevitable,” lawmaker darcisio perondi said in his report to the committee studying the measure. “brazil could repeat the tragedy of greece.”  perondi said the previous government of dilma rousseff, who was removed from office in august for breaking budget laws, left an onerous legacy of overdrawn accounts, and he called on the lawmakers who impeached her to back the cap. the conclusion of municipal elections in most cities across brazil last weekend allows temer’s ruling brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb) and its coalition allies a freer hand to back the measure. a small number of cities face a second round runoff this month. but resistance from rousseff’s workers party and its allies, as well as division within temer’s own coalition, point to a difficult path for a proposal that requires two approvals in each chamber of congress by a three fifths majority. “we will seek an injunction because this violates the constitution and the right of five future governments to decide their economic policies,” said opposition leader jandira feghali of the communist party of brazil. temer, 75, who was sworn in to serve the remainder of rousseff’s term through 2018, had vowed to put brazil back on its tracks and investors like his promises of fiscal discipline.  but a poll published on tuesday showed temer has failed to convince brazilians that his government is any better than rousseff’s. the survey by pollster ibope showed that temer’s approval ratings remain low and some 68 percent of brazilians do not trust him.  the lower house is also expected to vote on tuesday on a bill that changes the rules for the exploration of brazil’s vast offshore oil reserves in the costly subsalt layer, aimed at boosting private investment in the oil industry.  the proposal removes the obligation for scandal plagued, debt ridden state oil company petrobras to be the only operator of these oil fields and have a minimum 30 percent stake in their development.

" senator elizabeth warren, a massachusetts democrat who advocates for strong financial regulation, asked u.s. securities regulators on thursday to investigate comments made by major insurance companies about a forthcoming federal rule on retirement advice. last month, warren criticized lincoln national, jackson national life insurance company, prudential financial and transamerica, a unit of aegon nv , for publicly stating that the rule requiring retirement advisers to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own would hurt business while privately telling investors it would not create a major hurdle. on thursday, she went one step further and requested the securities and exchange commission to formally look into whether the statements were contradictory and ran afoul of securities laws.  “both sets of industry claims   that the proposed rule will harm them and their business model, and that the proposed rule will not harm them and their business model   cannot possibly be true. and if one these public statements is materially false, it would appear to violate long standing interpretations of our securities laws,” she wrote to sec chair mary jo white. the white house will soon publicly release the latest version of the rule, drafted by the labor department. the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law called for holding brokers who give retirement advice to a strong fiduciary standard, meaning they must act in their clients’ best interest, as a way to protect retirees from buying unnecessary products that line brokers’ pockets. the labor department had to withdraw its initial version of the rule in 2011 after complaints from members of both political parties and the financial services industry. warren says that financial and insurance companies have warned in public that the proposed rule could drive up costs and stop them from offering retirement services such as annuities to middle  and lower income people. but in earnings calls they have reassured investors that they will come up with new products or approaches that will minimize threats to their businesses. responding to warren’s critique last month, most of the insurers said their public warnings did not contradict reassurances to investors that they could withstand regulatory changes. they said their companies could navigate potential disruptions but they were still concerned about the consequences for consumers seeking retirement advice.

" u.s. lawmakers sharply criticized president barack obama’s administration on thursday over the disappearance of a former guantanamo detainee, calling for an end to transfers from the prison because of fears former prisoners could launch attacks on americans. they also raised concerns about reports that jihad diyab, a syrian among six detainees resettled in uruguay in december 2014, has disappeared and may now be in brazil. obama is working to close the u.s. military prison at guantanamo bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for 15 years, by transferring detainees not considered security threats to foreign countries. republican lawmakers worry that the obama administration is so eager to close the prison before he leaves office in january that it is sending detainees to countries that cannot ensure they will not return to the battlefield by joining militant groups that target americans and u.s. allies. “you’re talking about detainees who have every intent of killing american families,” republican representative joe wilson of south carolina said at a house of representatives foreign affairs committee hearing. the administration has considered sending guantanamo detainees to a prison in south carolina. the new york times reported that diyab said last month he was going on a religious retreat that would last into next week, and would be unreachable by telephone or email. since then, some uruguayan officials said they lost track of him and suggested he may have traveled to brazil, the newspaper reported. “many countries just aren’t up to the job,” said republican representative ed royce, the committee’s chairman. “... yet the administration has sent guantanamo terrorists to these countries anyway.” republican and some democratic committee members sharply questioned lee wolosky, the state department’s special envoy for closing the guantanamo detention center, and paul lewis, his pentagon counterpart. representative jeff duncan, another south carolina republican, said diyab, charged with forging passports for al qaeda, could pose a threat to the upcoming olympics in rio de janeiro, if he were indeed at large in that country. the committee’s ranking democrat, representative eliot engel, who backs the closure of the detention center in cuba, said it was important to keep the issue in perspective. “under no circumstances, in my opinion, is the obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street,” engel said.   lewis and wolosky said only 5 percent of detainees transferred since obama became president have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield. the percentage was higher for the over 500 released under president george w. bush. there are currently 79 detainees at guantanamo, of whom 29 are eligible for transfer. wolosky acknowledged diyab had been “difficult” from the time he was transferred to uruguay. according to the times, diyab’s friends and supporters say he is off praying and will re emerge soon. obama has been trying to make good on his 2009 pledge to close the facility. but congress has passed laws making it more difficult to do so, chiefly by barring transfers to u.s. prisons. lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. they have proposed even tighter controls on transfers in a fiscal 2017 defense policy bill, one reason obama has threatened a veto. guantanamo opponents say holding prisoners for years without charge or trial goes against fundamental u.s. values and since they are muslims, is a recruiting tool for islamist militants. many republicans insist the prison is an essential tool for handling suspects who threaten the united states. donald trump, the party’s presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, has called for the prison’s expansion.

" challengers to president donald trump’s travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries on thursday urged the u.s. supreme court to decide the policy’s legality even though it has been replaced with a revised plan. in separate letters to the court, the american civil liberties union and the state of hawaii said the justices  should still hear the case, which had been scheduled for arguments next week but was taken off their calendar after the administration announced the reworked ban last month. the challengers, characterizing the new ban as an indefinite extension of the previous one, said individuals who sued have an interest in the expired measure being declared unlawful because they continue to be harmed by the new policy.  hawaii also told the court in a separate letter that it intended to challenge trump’s latest travel ban by seeking on friday to amend its existing lawsuit against the previous one. the justice department urged the justices not to hear the case, to throw out earlier lower court rulings that had invalidated the ban and to order that the legal challenges be dismissed. trump’s three successive moves to block entry into the united states by people from several predominantly muslim countries have been among his most contentious acts since taking office in january. trump had promised as a candidate “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.”  the aclu told the court that the plaintiffs who sued to stop the policy “retain an all too real stake in the outcome of the case” even though the original 90 day travel ban on people from six countries expired on sept. 24. that order was signed by trump in march and was enacted with some changes in june with the high court’s blessing. the justices on sept. 25 asked all the parties to file court papers expressing views on whether the case was moot, meaning there was nothing left to decide, because the temporary ban expired. that ban had targeted people from iran, libya, syria, yemen, somalia and sudan. the new open ended ban announced in a presidential proclamation on sept. 24 removed sudan from the list and blocked people from chad and north korea and certain government officials from venezuela from entering the united states. among the issues raised by the challengers is whether the ban discriminated against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. a separate 120 day ban on refugees entering the united states that was part of trump’s march order expires on oct. 24. hawaii’s lawyers said that even if the high court decided not to issue a ruling, it should still leave the lower court decisions in place. to do otherwise would allow the administration to effectively win the case by erasing rulings that had gone against trump, hawaii argued. the justice department said that it wants the lower court rulings tossed because the challengers will otherwise cite them in new litigation against trump’s reworked ban. “the lower courts should be considering challenges to the proclamation anew based on its text, operation, and findings,” justice department lawyers wrote. the weekly behind closed doors meeting in which the justices consider next steps in cases before them is scheduled for friday morning. the court could make an announcement at any time. the new ban could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the united states. opponents have said that like the earlier two orders from january and march, it was still effectively a “muslim ban.”  even if the supreme court dismissed the older case, it may still have to weigh in on the issue in the future. various challengers have filed suit against the reworked ban, and those cases potentially could reach the high court.

" federal and state authorities are beefing up cyber defenses against potential electronic attacks on voting systems ahead of u.s. elections on nov. 8, but few are taking new steps to guard against possible civil unrest or violence. the threat of computer hacking and the potential for violent clashes is darkening an already rancorous presidential race between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump, amid fears that russia or other actors could spread political misinformation online or perhaps tamper with voting. to counter the cyber threat, all but two u.s. states have accepted help from the u.s. department of homeland security (dhs) to probe and scan voter registration and election systems for vulnerabilities, a department official told reuters. ohio has asked a cyber protection unit of the national guard, a reserve force within the u.s. military, for assistance to protect the state’s systems. on thursday, arizona secretary of state michele reagan and her cyber security team met with officials from the fbi and the dhs, in addition to state level agencies, to discuss cyber threats, said matt roberts, a spokesman for reagan. the national governors association on friday said election officials were well prepared for possible cyber threats and had been confronting them for over a decade. “we remain confident that any technical problems on election night will not undermine the overall integrity of the process,” the association said in a statement. unidentified intelligence officials told nbc news on thursday there is no specific warning about an election day attack, but they remain concerned hackers from russia or elsewhere may try to disrupt the process, likely by spreading misinformation through social media sites. the potential for violence around the election has loomed in the background of the campaign for months. armed groups around the country have pledged in unprecedented numbers to monitor voting sites for signs of election fraud. federal officials have warned authorities in new york, texas and virginia about an unspecific threat of attacks by the al qaeda militant group around election day, putting local law enforcement on alert before tuesday’s vote. a u.s. government source in washington said some federal agencies sent bulletins to local and state officials flagging the information but that the threat was relatively low level. “we are continuing with the high level of patrols at all of our facilities that we have had in place for some time now,” said spokesman steve coleman of the port authority, which operates airports, tunnels and bridges around the area. voter intimidation reported at polling sites so far prompted democrats to accuse trump of a “campaign of vigilante voter intimidation” in four states on monday. but local authorities surveyed by reuters on thursday in five states   ohio, pennsylvania, arizona, wisconsin and florida   said they were not increasing election related law enforcement personnel or resources above 2012 levels. the fbi, which designates one special agent from each of its 56 field offices for election crime matters, has not increased its numbers or given staff additional training this year, said an fbi spokeswoman. there has been no “substantive change” in the number of personnel deployed by the rest of the justice department, which designates assistant u.s. attorneys and federal prosecutors within the agency’s public integrity section to handle election crimes, according to a spokesman. jim pasco, executive director of the fraternal order of police, which represents hundreds of thousands of u.s. officers, said cops are taking the same security measures they would take for any large event. he said he expects the vows by militias to monitor the polls to be “a lot of talk, little action.” ",0

" at least eight north korean ships that left russia with a cargo of fuel this year headed for their homeland despite declaring other destinations, a ploy that u.s. officials say is often used to undermine sanctions. reuters has no evidence of wrongdoing by the vessels, whose movements were recorded in reuters ship tracking data. changing a ship s destination once underway is not forbidden and it is unclear whether any of the ships unloaded fuel in north korea.  but u.s. officials say that changing destination mid voyage is a hallmark of north korean state tactics to circumvent the international trade sanctions imposed over pyongyang s nuclear weapons program. changing course and the complex chain of different firms  many offshore   involved in shipments can complicate efforts to check how much fuel is supplied to north korea and monitor compliance with a cap on fuel imports under u.n. sanctions.    as part of north korea s efforts to acquire revenue, the regime uses shipping networks to import and export goods,  u.s. assistant secretary of the treasury marshall s. billingslea told the congressional foreign affairs committee this month.  north korea employs deceptive practices to conceal the true origins of these goods. pyongyang has been found to routinely falsify a vessel s identity and documentation.   the eight vessels identified in the tracking data set sail from the far eastern russian port of vladivostok or nearby nakhodka and registered china or south korea as their destination with the information system for state port control. after leaving russia, they were next recorded off the north korean ports of kimchaek, chongjin, hungnam or najin. none went on to china and most went back to russia.   all had a cargo of diesel, a source at the company that services vessels in vladivostok said. their cargo capacity ranged from 500 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes.  one of the vessels was the ma du san, owned by north korea s korea kyongun shipping co. it took on a cargo of 545 tonnes of marine fuel at vladivostok s pervaya rechka terminal, owned by russia s independent petroleum company (ipc).  reuters obtained a bill of lading   a receipt for goods issued when a ship loads up   dated may 19 showing the ma du san s cargo came from khabarovskiy npz, a refinery owned by ipc. the ship set sail on may 20. documents filed with russia s information system for state port control stated its next destination as the chinese port of zhanjiang and the bill of lading showed it as busan in south korea. the ma du san s next recorded location after vladivostok was inside the perimeter of the port of kimchaek   all the other ships were tracked only in the vicinity of ports. north korean ships intermittently turn off their transponders, and satellites cannot track them at such times, u.s. officials say. allegations outlined in two u.s. treasury department sanctions orders and a legal complaint filed by the u.s. government match the information reuters obtained on the ma du san though the u.s. documents do not name the vessel involved.  on june 1, the u.s. treasury department included ipc on its sanctions blacklist, saying it provided oil to north korea and may have been involved in circumventing sanctions. on aug. 22, the u.s. government sanctioned two more companies, both registered in singapore   transatlantic partners and velmur management pte. ltd. the legal complaint, also filed on aug. 22, accused the two firms of money laundering on behalf of sanctioned north korean banks seeking to buy petroleum products, citing a bill of lading for may 19 for a cargo of diesel sold by ipc to velmur and loaded in vladivostok   the same date as the bill of lading for the ma du san. andrey serbin, who represents transatlantic partners, said the firm had not received payments from a sanctions hit bank and that ownership of the fuel changed after it was loaded.  we sold the fuel to a chinese company,  serbin, who has been blacklisted by the u.s. government for  operating in the energy industry in the north korean economy  and working to purchase fuel for delivery to north korea, said of several shipments where the company acted as middleman.   there s no way we can control them (the goods),  he said. serbin did not identify the vessels transatlantic partners loaded fuel on to, but a source in a company that services ships in vladivostok said the ma du san was among them.  the bill of lading named the recipient of the ma du san s cargo as a company called llc sky shipping limited. reuters was unable to find any record of such a firm. velmur said it could not have known where the cargo would end up and did not knowingly help anyone dodge sanctions.  ipc did not respond to a request for comment. its parent company, bermuda registered alliance oil company ltd., denied having any contractual relations with north korean companies when u.s. sanctions were imposed on ipc. the u.s. treasury and state departments declined to answer questions about reuters  findings. russia s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about fuel exports to north korea but has said russia complies with the sanctions. russia s customs service said it could not provide information about movement of goods across borders. since the u.s. sanctions were imposed on ipc, all north korean flagged vessels that had been in vladivostok port have left, according to the tracking data.  they departed with no cargo, an employee with a shipping agent in vladivostok said. this is confirmed by documents seen by reuters. russian supplies of oil and oil products to north korea are much smaller than volumes shipped by china, pyongyang s only major ally. beijing has acted to reduce the flows, but russia s trade in all goods with north korea more than doubled in the first quarter of 2017 to $31.4 million. moscow s trade with pyongyang is under closer scrutiny following a series of missile launches by north korea and a test involving what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

" elected officials of cambodia s banned opposition party have begun handing over their duties after a court ordered the party dissolved, the government said on monday. the supreme court outlawed the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) last week at the request of authoritarian prime minister hun sen s government in a move that prompted the united states to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps. the party was banned after its leader, kem sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. the government says he sought to take power with american help. he rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow hun sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. among those told to give up their positions were councillors elected to communes in june, when the cnrp gained control of 40 percent of local councils, showing the electoral threat it posed to hun sen.  the implementation has been going smoothly,  the interior ministry s spokesman, khieu sopheak, told reuters on monday, adding that he did not know how long handover completion would take. the ruling cambodian people s party (cpp) will take over nearly all of the communes won by the opposition. the cnrp s 55 seats in the 123 member parliament will be shared among six minor parties, the national election committee (nec) said. it had been unable to contact one of the parties entitled to a seat because its headquarters was shut, it added. three nec members submitted a letter of resignation from the electoral body in protest at their party s dissolution, saying the redistribution of seats to other parties was  unconstitutional  and against  voters  will . the court has also banned 118 cnrp party members from politics for five years. mu sochua, a senior cnrp member who moved abroad shortly before the ban, said party officials met over the weekend outside cambodia  to put together an action plan for the immediate future.    we reject the decision of the court,  she said, adding that kem sokha remained president and the party s former leader, sam rainsy, had rejoined it. sam rainsy had resigned in february, saying he feared the party would be banned if he did not, because of defamation convictions that he calls politically motivated and which pushed him to flee cambodia in 2015. across cambodia, police took down cnrp signs outside party offices and on the streets. the interior ministry spokesman said the cnrp had helped by taking down its phnom penh headquarters sign itself. rejecting the criticism from the united states over the dissolution of the opposition party and a crackdown on local rights groups and independent media, hun sen said on sunday that washington should cut off all aid for cambodia.

" slovenia, birth country of u.s. first lady melania trump, expects revenues from foreign tourists to jump by about 9 percent this year and by at least 5 percent in 2018, economy minister zdravko pocivalsek said on tuesday. 2017 will be the fourth record year in a row for slovenian tourism after revenues from foreign tourists reached some 2.3 billion euros ($2.71 billion) last year, pocivalsek told a news conference. tourism in slovenia rose strongly because of  a general increase of tourism in europe and a successful promotion of slovenia as a safe country. officials say it also got something of a boost from melania trump having been born in the city of sevnica in southeastern slovenia before becoming a fashion model and moving to the united states.   we received a lot of attention from (international) journalists because of the u.s. first lady and we managed to present slovenia as an attractive, green country,  maja pak, head of the slovenian tourist organisation, told the same news conference. about 60 percent of slovenia is covered by forests while the country has some resorts on the adriatic sea as well as a number of alpine and spa tourist resorts.  pocivalsek also said slovenia plans to gradually privative all tourist accommodation infrastructure which should further improve tourism business. at present about 40 percent of hotels in slovenia are in state hands.  i want a well considered privatization ... which will be in favor of the state and the companies that are being sold,  pocivalsek said. in the first 10 months of 2017 the number of foreign tourists jumped by almost 17 percent year on year, the statistics office said last month.  in the first nine months of the year, the latest data available, the number of tourists from the united states rose by 23.4 percent, it added.  according to the government s tourism strategy the revenues from foreign tourists should rise to at least 3.7 billion euros per year by the end of 2021.

" senior members of german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives on saturday rejected the vision for a  united states of europe  put forward by the social democrats (spd), with whom they are hoping to form a governing coalition. spd leader martin schulz said on thursday his party, which suffered its worst post war election result in september, would only gain support by providing a clear vision of europe, and called for a united states of europe by 2025. merkel s conservatives, who lost voters to the far right due to their liberal migrant policy, want the spd to agree to a last ditch alliance with them after talks on a tie up with two smaller parties collapsed. discussions on maintaining the conservative spd coalition, which has governed germany since 2013, are due to start on wednesday but the two parties look set to clash over the issue of europe, which is likely to play a key role in talks. senior conservative volker kauder said schulz s european proposal posed  a danger to the eu and citizens  approval of europe  and peter altmaier, merkel s chancellery chief, said the idea, and especially the timeframe, was unrealistic. an emnid poll for bild newspaper found less than a third of germans (30 percent) supported schulz s idea while almost half (48 percent) rejected it. kauder told the tagesspiegel newspaper it was necessary to strengthen europe but also important to recognize that at the moment people longed for the  reliability that they believe they can find in national states . he added:  the proposal would also jeopardize the work of unification that is unique in the history of the world because the majority of member states certainly wouldn t participate in creating a united states.  altmaier told the rheinische post newspaper that schulz s proposal had surprised him and it would be better to tackle specific problems in europe such as unemployment, the protection of external borders and coordination of economic policy.  the discussion about whether europe should be a federal state, confederation or a united states is one for academics and journalists   not for german foreign policy,  altmaier said.  a united states of europe would transfer member states  sovereignty to brussels and there would not be a majority for that in many eu states,  he added. merkel has also been skeptical, saying on thursday she would rather concentrate on more cooperation in defense by 2025, on employment and on innovation. the christian social union (csu)   the bavarian sister party to merkel s christian democrats (cdu)   also rejected schulz s plan. senior csu member markus soeder told welt am sonntag his party did not want germany becoming an  administrative unit  of the european commission in a  european superstate . but the spd defended schulz s plan, with foreign minister sigmar gabriel telling deutschlandfunk radio it would ensure europe s voice is heard on the global stage at a time when the influence of asia, latin america and africa is growing. the spd is stressing that the outcome of talks with the conservatives is still open but schulz said on saturday if the spd had the chance to prevent old age poverty, improve nursing care and affordable housing, it needed to take that opportunity. other options are a merkel led minority government or new elections. the spd has not ruled out either possibility, and newly elected spd general secretary lars klingbeil told bild newspaper he would immediately start preparing for a possible election campaign. the spd had initially planned to revamp itself in opposition after its poor election showing but agreed to talk to the conservatives when other coalition talks collapsed. an emnid poll showed 61 percent of germans thought joining another  grand coalition  would weaken the spd further. kauder said the conservatives would go into talks prepared to make compromises but added his party had some  absolutely key demands  like capping migration and suspending the right to family reunions for some asylum seekers.

" the u.s. intelligence community will soon disclose an estimate of the number of americans whose electronic communications have been caught in the crosshairs of online surveillance programs intended for foreigners, u.s. lawmakers said in a letter seen by reuters on friday. the estimate, requested by members of the u.s. house of representatives judiciary committee, is expected to be made public as early as next month, the letter said. its disclosure would come as congress is expected to begin debate in the coming months over whether to reauthorize or reform the so called surveillance authority, known as section 702, a provision that was added to the foreign intelligence surveillance act in 2008. “the timely production of this information is incredibly important to informed debate on section 702 in the next congress— and, without it, even those of us inclined to support reauthorization would have reason for concern,” said the letter signed by 11 lawmakers, all members of the house judiciary committee. the letter was sent on friday to national intelligence director james clapper. it said his office and national security agency (nsa) officials had already briefed congressional staff about how the intelligence community intends to comply with the disclosure request. clapper’s office confirmed the letter had been received but declined further comment. the lawmakers termed their letter an effort to “memorialize our understanding” of the intelligence community’s plan to provide an estimate in real numbers, not percentages, as soon as january that can be shared with the public. the government has long held that calculating the number of americans subject to section 702 surveillance might be technically impossible and would require privacy intrusions exceeding those raised by the actual surveillance programs, which were originally intended to counter foreign espionage. intelligence officials have said that online data about americans is “incidentally” collected under section 702, due to a range of technical and practical reasons. critics have assailed such collection as back door surveillance of americans without a warrant. section 702 will expire on dec. 31, 2017, absent congressional action. it enables two internet surveillance programs called prism and upstream that were revealed in a series of leaks by former nsa contractor edward snowden more than three years ago. prism gathers messaging data from alphabet inc’s google, facebook , microsoft, apple  and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. upstream allows the nsa to copy web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the united states and search that data for certain terms associated with a target. clapper, who is stepping down next month, suggested in april that providing an estimate of americans surveilled under section 702, a figure some have said could tally in the millions, might be possible, while defending the law as “a prolific producer of critical intelligence.” republicans james sensenbrenner, darrell issa, ted poe and jason chaffetz signed the letter, in addition to democrats john conyers, jerrold nadler, zoe lofgren, hank johnson, ted deutch, suzan delbene and david cicilline.

" riding high after a landslide victory in saturday’s south carolina primary, democratic front runner hillary clinton has set sights on a possible face off in the nov. 8 presidential election with donald trump, the favorite for the republican nomination.  “despite what you hear, we don’t need to make america great again. america has never stopped being great,” she told supporters in her victory speech in south carolina, declining to mention trump by name, but taking a jab at his campaign slogan, “make america great again.” clinton said she was not taking anything for granted after crushing democratic rival bernie sanders on saturday by 48 percentage  points, likely setting herself up for a good “super tuesday” night on march 1, a key date in the nomination battle. but if clinton and trump win big on tuesday as opinion polls suggest, the chance of a general election matchup between them increases, adding another twist to a presidential campaign that has defied convention as u.s. voters vent frustration over economic uncertainty, illegal immigration and national security threats. some clinton backers, emboldened by the heightened chance of a trump nomination, have reaffirmed their support for the former secretary of state, saying that it is she, not sanders, who is best equipped to take down trump in a head to head showdown in november. rosilyne scott, 58, of texas, cast her vote early for clinton ahead of texas’s upcoming tuesday nominating contest, calling the prospect of a trump presidency “frightening.” “i just think she has more support, and she’s been doing it a lot longer,” she said.  “if you get someone like donald trump in, i don’t know. ... i think he’s a joke, a bigot, a racist.” amid clinton’s renewed momentum against sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, donors have also found resolve. one clinton fundraiser in california said her recent victories in nevada and south carolina have prompted more people to donate to her campaign and to attend clinton events. he said he had raised $10,000 for the clinton campaign in the past week alone.  a trump clinton election would embody the outsider versus establishment battle in american politics. trump has never been elected to public office, while the former first lady has been a player in washington for decades.   south carolina was clinton’s third victory in the first four democratic contests, raising more questions about whether sanders, a democratic socialist, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. exit polls showed clinton winning big in the state with almost every constituency. she won nine of every 10 black voters, as well as women, men, urban, suburban, rural, very liberal and conservative voters. sanders was ahead among voters between ages 18 and 29, and among white men. when asked which candidate they thought “can win in november,” an overwhelming 79 percent said clinton, with only 21 percent putting their faith in sanders to defeat the eventual republican nominee. sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and successfully courted many of the party’s youth, on sunday acknowledged he had been “decimated” by clinton in south carolina. he set his sights on march 1, where a win in a key state is crucial to keeping his hopes alive. “i think we’re going to do well on super tuesday, we’re going to do well in many states after that and we look forward to those state by state struggles,” he said in an interview on nbc news’s “meet the press.” but sanders needs to have his breakout moment sooner rather than later, warned longtime democratic activist phil noble, who said that sanders’ momentum in south carolina “fell off the table” after clinton’s solid victory in nevada on feb. 20.      “he’s got to pull off a surprise against clinton soon or he won’t have time to recover,” he said.

" thousands of people took to the streets of tehran on wednesday to bury a soldier whose beheading by islamic state has come to symbolize the righteousness of iran s military involvement in syria. in what has become an iconic image on iranian media, 25 year old revolutionary guard mohsen hojaji is shown looking calmly into camera after his capture as he is led away by an insurgent with blood on his face, holding a knife. the photograph was posted by islamic state. even iranians critical of their government s military intervention in syria to help president bashar al assad have taken to social media to express their admiration for hojaji, who was killed last month. the revolutionary guards, iran s most powerful military force who also oversee an economic empire worth billions of dollars, were initially quiet about their role in syria. but in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the sunni muslim extremists of islamic state who see shi ites, the majority of iran s population, as apostates. guards killed in syria and iraq are touted as protectors of shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine  on websites linked to the guards. supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei prayed over hojaji s coffin and met with his family on wednesday, state media reported. large crowds carrying red flags, symbolizing martyrdom, and pictures of hojaji processed to the funeral in tehran, pictures on state tv showed. parliament speaker ali larijani and former president mahmoud ahmadinejad were among the dignitaries who attended, state media said.  look at what a stir the martyrdom of this youth has created in the country,  khamenei said, according to his website. hojaji s funeral comes only three days before ashura, one of the most important religious events for shi ites and a traditional period of mourning which commemorates the death of imam hussein, the grandson of the prophet mohammed. the guards recovered hojaji s body through a deal between islamic state, the syrian army and lebanese shi ite group hezbollah. more than 300 is fighters and about 300 family members were allowed to evacuate syria s western border with lebanon under the ceasefire agreement.  on june 7, islamic state claimed an attack on tehran s parliament and the mausoleum of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, the founder of the islamic republic, killing 18 people. the revolutionary guards fired missiles at islamic state bases in syria on june 18 in response.

" new york city public defenders on thursday criticized a proposal by mayor bill de blasio to deny free legal counsel to immigrants in deportation hearings if they had been convicted of serious crimes in the past, saying the plan would deny them due process. in his proposed annual budget, de blasio allocated $16.4 million to legal services for immigrant new yorkers, citing concern about u.s. president donald trump’s crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.  lawyers, local lawmakers and civil rights activists welcomed the funding proposal, which sharply increases legal aid for immigrants. but they gathered on the steps of city hall to criticize a provision they said would unfairly deprive some people of the right to due process under the law.  de blasio’s proposal would deny city funded lawyers to immigrants previously convicted of one of 170 crimes that the city considers serious or violent.   jennifer friedman, who runs the immigration practice at bronx defenders, said the mayor’s plan would create a “two tier system that treats people different based on their criminal history.” the funding be in addition to the new york immigrant family unity project (nyifup), which has been funded by the city council since 2013 and provides free lawyers to immigrants facing deportation hearings at the federal immigration court.  in the united states, the right to a lawyer does not extend to federal immigration hearings which are civil, not criminal, proceedings.  the plan contradicted de blasio’s description of new york as a “sanctuary city” for immigrants, the public defenders said. seth stein, a city hall spokesman, wrote in an email that “the public should not be expected to foot the bill” for immigrants convicted of dangerous crimes. “the vast majority of immigrants have not been convicted of violent crimes,” he wrote. more than 2,000 immigrants have received free lawyers under the council funded program, which provides free lawyers regardless of an immigrant’s criminal record, in the four years since it began, legal aid said.  in new york city, immigrants without lawyers managed to overturn a removal order in court only 3 percent of the time, while those with lawyers were able to remain in the country 30 percent of the time, legal aid said.

" state and local governments need to become more self sufficient in handling major disasters like hurricane harvey, fema administrator brook long said in a televised interview on sunday. speaking on cbs’ face the nation, long said the federal support is intended to be a “ray of hope, a bridge to kick start recovery,” and state and local governments need to do more on their own. they should not expect the federal government to make their citizens whole after major disasters, he said.  “we need elected officials at all levels to sit down and hit the reset button and make sure they have everything they need to increase levels of self sufficiency,” long said.  he called the massive devastation “a wakeup call for local and state officials,” saying they needed to fully fund their own emergency management offices and have rainy day funds set aside for such emergencies. “they can’t depend only on federal emergency management,” he said following pointed calls by houston officials for fema to quickly increase staffing in the city and provide relief funds.  long declined to offer an amount the white house would request congress to provide for additional emergency assistance in the wake of harvey. earlier texas governor greg abbott said the cost of the storm had risen to between $150 billion and $180 billion.  houston is making progress on several fronts to recover from harvey, resuming city services and helping get people into housing and out of emergency shelters, houston mayor sylvester turner said in separate comments on face the nation on sunday.  “this is a can do city. we’re not going to engage in a pity party,” said turner. “people are taking care of each other.” speaking from the city’s convention center, which once housed 10,000 people fleeing from flooding, he said there are “significantly less than 2,000” people now staying at the shelter.

" u.s. democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton begins a two day tour on monday through rural, traditionally coal reliant parts of the eastern appalachian region where republican rival donald trump’s pro coal, anti trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters.  clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in kentucky, west virginia and ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices. her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in march when clinton, at an ohio town hall, said the country would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” clinton’s statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and republican lawmakers such as u.s. senators rand paul and mitch mcconnell, both from kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out president barack obama’s regulatory “war” on coal. clinton immediately sent an apology letter to democratic u.s. senator joe manchin of west virginia, an early supporter, pledging to “focus my team and administration on bringing jobs to appalachia” and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the u.s. energy market. her decision to embark on an appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of democratic nominating contests in west virginia on may 10 and in kentucky on may 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the party’s july convention. clinton won ohio’s contest in mid march, besting rival bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont. however, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now.  clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, campaigned on sunday in west virginia, encountering protests from trump supporters and being asked about clinton’s town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in kentucky on tuesday. west virginia last voted for a democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when bill clinton was running for his second four year term. he is the only democrat who has won kentucky since 1980. during her first presidential run, clinton defeated obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. her tour is an early move to siphon support from trump, the front runner for the republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority. clinton’s first stop, at a restaurant in ashland, kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when ak steel holding corp announced in october that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices. clinton last month criticized china’s announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on chinese trade practices. she will continue to williamson, west virginia, a once thriving town near the state’s border with kentucky in mingo county, the heart of the coal producing region. its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. the town is now trying to reshape its economy. clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the williamson health and wellness center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health focused, local foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large scale agricultural development. aides say clinton’s interest in the region’s economic troubles was piqued after she left the u.s. state department in 2013. she circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less educated white adults in appalachia, where the decline in coal related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues. clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to “shirk” the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

" senior u.s. and german officials agreed this week to deepen their collaboration on a range of cyber issues, including working to promote norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace and expanding training in developing countries. the two governments underscored their shared strategic goals in a joint statement issued thursday after a two day annual bilateral meeting on cyber issues. christopher painter, cyber coordinator for the u.s. state department, said the two countries already worked together closely in many areas, including law enforcement, human rights and other areas, but the fourth annual talks were focused on a broader, “whole of government” approach. “having this annual discussion ... brings all the agencies together and it’s a good way to take stock and make sure we’re going in the right direction and thinking about how we can collaborate even further,” he told reuters in an interview. ties between germany and the united states remain strong despite tensions that flared after documents released by whistleblower edward snowden in 2013, which showed the national security agency had spied on german chancellor angela merkel. painter said he had spoken in germany many times since that incident and washington had not shied away from engaging germany on the issue of surveillance and privacy. but he said it was not hampering cooperation and collaboration in other cyber areas. “this is something that we continue to address and we take seriously,” he said. “at the same time ... we can’t let that discussion, as important as it is, divide us and detract us from talking about all the other issues we have in common and the long term goals we have.”  painter said the two sides welcomed a consensus 2015 un group of governmental experts report which affirmed that international law applied in cyberspace, and adoption of additional confidence building measures. germany planned to continue working for wider adoption of cyber norms in its role as the new chairman of the 57 nation organization for security and cooperation (osce), he said. given limited personnel and resources, the two countries also planned to share information on their training work in africa, latin america and other parts of the developing world.   “we all have limited resources, so it’s very helpful for us to share what we’re doing so we’re not all training the same three guys in a country.” the next bilateral cyber dialogue will occur in berlin in 2017.

" japan s foreign minister taro kono told the united nations security council on friday that north korea was  nowhere near ready  to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and was not interested in a meaningful dialogue.  he noted that north korea s intercontinental ballistic missile launch last month came 75 days after its previous tests.  some optimistic views labeled 75 days of silence as a positive signal. however, the missile launch in november made it clear that north korea was continuing to relentlessly develop its nuclear and missile programs even while they were seemingly silent,  he told the 15 member council.

" virginia governor terry mcauliffe on wednesday vetoed a bill that would have allowed ministers and others refuse to marry gay couples because of their religious beliefs. mcauliffe, a democrat, said the measure approved by the republican controlled legislature was unconstitutional and would drive business away from the state. “although couched as a ‘religious freedom’ bill, this legislation is nothing more than an attempt to stigmatize,” he said in a statement. the republicans do not have enough votes in the state’s general assembly to override the veto. the bill would have  granted ministers and others empowered to wed people the right to deny marriage services to same sex couples if performing them would violate their religious beliefs. mcauliffe’s move comes just days after georgia’s republican governor said he would veto a similar bill after the measure drew national criticism.. similar measures in states such as indiana and arkansas sparked criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat. north carolina is also seeing protests over anew law that bars transgender people from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.

" senator susan collins is back in the spotlight as a crucial swing vote in the u.s. senate as she raises questions about how combining a republican tax cut plan with a partial repeal of obamacare will affect middle class americans.  a day after senate republican leader mitch mcconnell decided to link the two issues in a risky strategy, collins, a moderate republican from maine, was citing data that she called worrisome, casting new doubts over the tax plan’s outlook. she told reporters in the capitol on wednesday that her staff’s research showed pairing tax cuts with an effective repeal of the individual mandate of obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act (aca), could be a mistake. “i have data that demonstrates for certain middle income individuals and couples, who do not qualify for subsidies under the aca ... that the premium increase will outweigh the tax cut that they get,” she said. “i suspected this, based on what i know about insurance markets, but now i have the actual data.” collins was one of a handful of republicans who voted in july to block a broader republican attempt to dismantle obamacare, former democratic president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. the failure of the final repeal effort, in which collins was joined in opposition by fellow republicans john mccain and lisa murkowski, was a stinging defeat for president donald trump and republican congressional leaders eager to fulfill their campaign promise to scrap obamacare. collins, 64, a senator since 1997, decided last month against running for governor of maine in favor of staying in the senate, where her status as a centrist republican willing to work with democrats has made her one of the most influential members of congress. that has become especially obvious in recent months. after her role in halting obamacare repeal efforts during the summer, she said in september she would oppose another republican healthcare overhaul, known as cassidy graham, leaving it short of the votes needed to pass. she cited concerns about its proposed cuts to the medicaid healthcare program for the poor. collins, along with mccain, murkowski and senator ron johnson, has emerged in the past 24 hours as pivotal to winning senate approval of the tax cut plan, which is backed by the president and is critical to the party’s 2018 electoral prospects as they seek their first major legislative win since trump took office in january. in an unexpected move, mcconnell on tuesday inserted a proposed individual mandate repeal in the senate tax plan. the mandate, long opposed by republicans, requires americans to have health insurance or pay a federal fine. the rule is meant to ensure enough young, healthy people are in obamacare to offset the costs of covering sicker and older people. repealing the mandate, the nonpartisan congressional budget office said last week, would increase the number of americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027 and raise average obamacare marketplace insurance policy premiums by about 10 percent annually over the next decade. that premium increase could cancel out any tax cut gains some middle class americans stand to make under the senate tax plan, according to the research cited by collins, who oversaw maine’s bureau of insurance before she came to the senate. collins has not taken a stand on the tax plan. “i am going to wait and evaluate what is in the bill,” she said. “i do believe our taxes need to be overhauled. ... i just don’t know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the aca.” johnson, in a statement on wednesday, said: “neither the house nor senate bill provide fair treatment, so i do not support either in their current version.” the wisconsin lawmaker added he would work with his republican colleagues to produce better legislation. murkowski, when asked on wednesday if she backed the tax cut plan with a mandate repeal, said she was focused on opening alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge (anwr) to oil drilling, a key goal for the alaska lawmaker. a committee that murkowski chairs on wednesday passed a bill to open anwr to drilling, which is now expected to be attached to the tax legislation.

" some prominent republicans are urging donald trump to quit as the party’s presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. the real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the white house race and wrote on twitter on sunday that republicans who are attacking him are “self righteous hypocrites.”     with only a month to go before the nov. 8 election against democrat hillary clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute trump for his running mate mike pence or anyone else, republican strategists and u.s. election experts said.     it is “virtually impossible to replace somebody in august, let alone october,” republican strategist karl rove said on “fox news sunday.”  after a video of trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced friday, republicans such as u.s. senator mike lee of utah and senator mark kirk of illinois urged trump to remove himself from the race. the 2005 video showed trump, then a reality tv star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife, melania.  making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to election day would be without precedent in the history of modern u.s. presidential elections. in 1972, democratic presidential candidate george mcgovern’s running mate, thomas eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. eagleton withdrew from the race in august of that year and was replaced by sargent shriver. in 2000, missouri voters faced a last minute candidate change in the state’s u.s. senate race after the democratic challenger mel carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. carnahan’s name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. his widow, jean carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.   republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated.  the party does have procedure, known as rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit. republican leaders could try to pressure trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. but as of sunday, trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race. but if trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160 member committee of the republican convention to select a new nominee, said thomas schwartz, a presidential historian at vanderbilt university. experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with republican attorneys fighting state by state legal battles to make the last minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed. even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. about 411,000 americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to michael p. mcdonald, a florida state university political science professor who tracks early voting. the figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more. another problem for republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. concern about such challenges could deter some republicans from voting. the republican party might argue that those ballots already cast for trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said matthew dallek, an expert on presidential politics at george washington university’s graduate school of political management. democratic national committee chairwoman donna brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by republicans to replace trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be “very confusing” for voters with early ballots already being cast. “it would be political suicide for donald trump to step down right now,” she told abc news. “i’m sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway,” she said when asked if democrats would oppose any effort by republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots. dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to “utter chaos.” “we would be operating in uncharted territory. you would be in this legal netherworld,” he said.

" u.s. president donald trump’s order temporarily banning visitors from seven muslim majority countries shows that his administration does not understand its counterterrorism duties, chinese state media said on wednesday. trump’s jan. 27 order, which he says is necessary for national security, sought to bar entry by travelers from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days, and by all refugees for 120 days, except for refugees from syria, who face an indefinite ban. the move, which sparked protests and chaos at u.s. and overseas airports, has been suspended by a federal judge in seattle and is now under intense scrutiny from a u.s. federal appeals court questioning whether it unfairly targeted people over their religion. china’s government has offered mild criticism of the ban, saying immigration policy was a sovereign right but “reasonable concerns” must be considered. but the official xinhua news agency said trump’s order “shows that his administration has no correct recognition of the responsibility it needs to shoulder in a global fight against terrorism”. “radical elements around the world could use the ban to further justify their ruthless causes, and to gain more recruits,” xinhua said in a commentary. “that is a grave threat not only to the safety and security of the united states, but that of others worldwide. “banned countries on the list, such as iraq, libya and syria, have been victimized by terrorism because previous u.s. governments and other western powers deliberately intervened for self interests,” it added. such commentaries from xinhua do not equate to government policy, but often reflect official thinking. the world’s most populous nation generally accepts few refugees. china offered permanent residence to 1,576 foreigners in 2016, the public security ministry has said, but such openings are largely reserved for experts and professionals. china, which says it faces a serious threat from terrorism, has often rebuked the united states and other western countries for what it considers their double standards on terrorism. nervous about being implicated in possible human rights abuses, western nations have been reluctant to cooperate in china’s campaign in its far western region of xinjiang, where  officials say islamist militants aim to set up a separate state. rights advocates say ethnic violence in the region in recent years is a response to repressive government policies affecting the largely muslim uighur people who call xinjiang home, though china denies rights abuses there.

" a federal judge on thursday postponed until april the sentencing date for dennis hastert, convicted last year of a financial crime, because the former u.s. house speaker was still recovering from a stroke and life threatening infection. hastert pleaded guilty in october to a federal charge of “structuring”   evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in smaller increments   in a hush money case stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct. the 74 year old, once one of the country’s most powerful politicians, went to the hospital in early november after a fall, his attorney, john gallo, told u.s. district judge thomas durkin. hastert was treated for a spinal infection requiring surgery, a severe blood infection and suffered a stroke, nearly dying, gallo said. durkin reset hastert’s sentencing for april 8, from feb. 29. hastert currently requires 24 hour care. he is able to feed himself and is articulate, but a doctor has said he should not leave his home except to go to the hospital. gallo said hastert can still help prepare for his sentencing, and his doctors would know better about his prognosis in a month. hastert faces up to five years in prison but prosecutors have recommended a sentence of six months or less, in exchange for his guilty plea. hastert admitted to paying $1.7 million in cash to an individual he had known for decades to buy that person’s silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual. prosecutors did not spell out the misconduct, but unnamed law enforcement officials have told media that it was sexual and involved someone hastert knew when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of yorkville, illinois, in the 1960s and 1970s.",0
" the senate environment and public works committee on wednesday approved four nominees to key posts at the environmental protection agency, including one appointee with ties to the chemical industry who will head the agency’s office of chemical safety. senator tom carper, the top democrat on the committee, said two of the nominees were of “grave concern”: bill wehrum, nominated for assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, and michael dourson to head up the office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. carper called dourson “one of the most troubling nominees i have ever considered during my time on this committee.”  senator james inhofe of oil producing oklahoma, the panel’s senior republican, praised the passage of the nominees and urged the full senate to quickly confirm them so they can “improve public health within the scope of the epa’s authority.” republicans say the epa under former president barack obama overstepped its authority to regulate. scott pruitt, president donald trump’s epa administrator, has said the agency had an “activist agenda” under former president barack obama. pruitt has worked to do away with regulations pushed through by the obama administration, and has proposed scrapping the landmark clean power plan that sought to curb emissions linked to climate change. pruitt sued the agency more than a dozen times when he was oklahoma’s attorney general.   jeff holmstead, a former head of the epa air and radiation office under former president george w. bush, said wehrum is the “ideal person to shepherd administrator pruitt’s reforms through the regulatory process.”  environmentalists called on the full senate to reject the nominees. “all four of these nominees, especially wehrum and dourson, would accelerate scott pruitt’s mission to dismantle the epa from the inside,” said sara chieffo, vice president for government affairs at the league of conservation voters. the other nominees approved by the panel are matthew leopold for assistant administrator for the office of general counsel, and david ross, for the office of water.

" indian prime minister narendra modi will discuss rising violence in myanmar s western rakhine state during a visit that begins on tuesday, and push for greater progress on long running indian infrastructure projects, officials said.  india seeks to boost economic ties with resource rich myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600 km (1,000 mile) border, to counter chinese influence and step up connectivity with a country it considers its gateway to southeast asia. two way trade has grown to around $2.2 billion as india courted myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but indian funded projects have moved slowly. modi s promises to  act east  and cement ties with india s eastern neighbor have slipped even as china has strengthened its influence. his first bilateral visit comes amid a spike in violence in rakhine, after a military counter offensive against insurgents killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of nearly 90,000 villagers to bangladesh since aug. 25. the violence could hit development of a transport corridor that begins in rakhine, with the indian built port of sittwe and includes road links to india s remote northeast, analysts said.  it s going to be a very vexed and complex issue,  said tridivesh singh maini, a new delhi based expert on ties with myanmar.  you need to play it very smartly. you need to make it clear that rakhine violence has regional implications... but india will not get into saying,  this is how you should resolve it.  last month, india said it wanted to deport 40,000 rohingya refugees who left myanmar in previous years. modi arrives from china late on tuesday in the capital naypyidaw to meet president htin kyaw on a three day visit. new delhi believes the best way to reduce tension in rakhine is through development efforts, such as the kaladan transport project there, said indian foreign ministry official sripriya ranganathan.      we are very confident that once that complete corridor is functional, there will be a positive impact on the situation in the state,  she told reporters. modi will meet myanmar leader aung san suu kyi and visit the heritage city of bagan and a hindu temple. the countries share close cultural ties, and several in myanmar trace their roots to india.  modi will also talk up a trilateral highway project connecting india s northeast with myanmar and thailand.  there is a fear that china is already going full steam ahead,  said udai bhanu singh of delhi think tank, the institute for defence studies and analyses.  from the indian side, there has been some laxity.   singh said india could offer myanmar help in building its navy and coastguard, while myanmar would seek assurances that india was a reliable economic partner and an alternative power to beijing.

" myanmar s government will manage the redevelopment of villages torched during violence in rakhine state that has sent nearly half a million rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh, a minister was reported on wednesday as saying. the plan for the redevelopment of areas destroyed by fires, which the government has blamed on rohingya insurgents, is likely to raise concern about prospects for the

reconstruction in areas damaged in disasters, including conflict. there was no elaboration on any plan or what access to their old villages any returning rohingya could expect. the minister was not immediately available for comment. human rights groups using satellite images have said about half of more than 400 rohingya villages in the north of rankine state have been burned in the violence. refugees arriving in bangladesh have accused the army and buddhist vigilantes of mounting a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving rohingya out of myanmar. in washington, lawmakers in the u.s. congress condemned the treatment of the rohingya and some questioned the former obama administration s decision to lift sanctions on myanmar after a civilian led government came to power. ed royce, republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, told a hearing the myanmar government s response to the crisis had been  appalling.  he said national leader aung san suu kyi had a duty to speak out and that her statements on the crisis had been  widely off the mark.   perpetrators of this ethnic cleansing must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,  he said. ted yoho, republican chair of the subcommittee, said the military crackdown had been characterized by  sickening crimes against humanity  and said washington should look at what policy options were available to stop the military violence and encourage the government to take a firmer stand against it. the trump administration has stepped up its criticism of the myanmar military s behavior, but has refrained from using the terms  ethnic cleansing  or  crimes against humanity  and given no indication of plans to re impose sanctions on the country where it competes for influence with strategic rival china. buddhist majority myanmar has rejected u.n. accusations of ethnic cleansing of rohingya muslims in response to coordinated attacks by rohingya insurgents on the security forces on aug. 25. it has also rejected accusations of crimes against humanity leveled this week by human rights watch. the government has said about half of rohingya villages have been abandoned, but blames insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army for attacking civilians. it says nearly 500 people have been killed since aug. 25, nearly 400 of them insurgents. the violence and the refugee exodus is the biggest crisis that the government of nobel peace laureate suu kyi has faced since it came to power last year in a transition from nearly 50 years of military rule. myanmar considers the rohingya illegal immigrants from bangladesh and bouts of suppression and strife have flared for decades. most rohingya are stateless. suu kyi has faced scathing criticism and calls for her nobel prize to be withdrawn. she denounced rights violations in an address last week and vowed that abusers would be prosecuted. she also said any refugees verified as coming from myanmar under a 1992 process agreed with bangladesh would be allowed back. suu kyi has little, if any, control over the security forces under a military drafted constitution that also bars her from the presidency and gives the military veto power over political reform. many refugees are gloomy about their chances of going home, saying they fear they lack the paperwork they expect would be demanded to prove they came from myanmar. myanmar is due to take a party of diplomats to the conflict zone on thursday to let them see the situation. a group of aid organizations said on tuesday the total number of refugees who had fled to bangladesh since aug. 25 had been revised up to 480,000, after 35,000 people were found to have been missed out of the previous tally. aid agencies say refugees are still arriving, though at a slower pace. they have an overall plan to help 1.2 million people, including 200,000 rohingya who were already in camps in bangladesh and 300,000 people in  host communities .  they have absolutely nothing,  u.n. high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi said in geneva after returning from a visit to the camps in bangladesh.  it is very clear the cause of this crisis is in myanmar but that the solution is also in myanmar,  he said.   the risk of spread of terrorist violence in this particular region is very, very high  unless the issue was resolved, he warned. grandi said he had not been informed about government plans for redevelopment but it had to include all communities.  if development is not inclusive, it will not be addressing the root causes and solve the problem,  he said.

" the u.s. defense department needs to better manage its finances if it hopes to rebuild and modernize the u.s. armed forces, the government accountability office said in a report released on tuesday. the pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  u.s. president donald trump’s $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the department of defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the department of energy and other national defense priorities. the gao report comes as u.s. defense secretary jim mattis presented lawmakers in the house and senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. the report said despite increased defense funding under trump, efforts “underway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forces” are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the pentagon.  the federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the defense department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of u.s. special forces.  “dod has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces,” the report said.  u.s. president donald trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former president barack obama had sought in his long term budget plan. the $574.5 billion for the department of defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  gao said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to dod since 2006. of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. the report released on tuesday made no new recommendations.

" warren buffett is closely monitoring whether u.s. president donald trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. “it’s an actual factor at berkshire,” buffett, the chairman of berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n), said in a tuesday interview with cnbc television. “and it’s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.” buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. but when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said “i think about them plenty” now. “we’ve got actions on both sides that we would take,” referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. berkshire has said it ended june with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. the conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as american express co (axp.n), coca cola co (ko.n) and wells fargo & co (wfc.n), while other bets such as international business machines corp (ibm.n) have fared less well. buffett had said at berkshire’s annual meeting in omaha, nebraska, on may 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. that might be a good strategy now, if trump and many congressional republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. buffett explained that he would “feel kind of silly” realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. he said other investors sitting on “hundreds of billions” of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. it is unclear whether the republican controlled congress can pass a tax bill that trump will sign, and buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the affordable care act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president’s priorities. he expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. “i would think the republicans controlling both houses [of congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,” buffett said. “i think they can get it done.” ",0
" gunmen who attacked a mosque on friday in egypt s north sinai brandished an islamic state flag as they opened fire through doorways and windows, killing more than 300 worshippers, including two dozen children, officials said on saturday. no group has claimed responsibility, but egyptian forces are battling a stubborn islamic state affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by u.s. backed forces in iraq and syria. the assault on a mosque has stunned egyptians, prompting president abdel fattah al sisi s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in egypt s modern history.  state news agency mena said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured. egypt s public prosecutor s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked islamic state militants, also known as daesh, to the attack on the al rawdah mosque in bir al abed, west of el arish city.  the worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,  the prosecutor said in a statement.  they numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles.  the gunmen, some wearing masks and military style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage. witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.  when the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,  magdy rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed.  but i was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.  striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting christian churches and pilgrims. local sources said some of the worshippers were sufis, whom groups such as islamic state consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for islamists is tantamount to idolatry. islamic state has targeted sufi and shi ite muslims in other countries like iraq. the jihadists in egypt s sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police. sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against islamist militants, promised the  utmost force  against those responsible for friday s attack. security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re election next year. egypt s military carried out air strikes and raids overnight to target hideouts and vehicles involved in the attack, the army said, without giving details on the number of militants.  what is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,  sisi said on friday. the sinai attack came as sisi s government looks to draw more foreign investment and finish an imf reform program to help revive an economy that struggled through instability after the 2011 uprising ousted long standing leader hosni mubarak. north sinai, a mostly desert area stretching from the suez canal eastwards to the gaza strip and israel, has long been a security headache for egypt and is a strategic region for cairo because of its sensitive borders. local militant group ansar bayt al maqdis, once allied to al qaeda, split from it and declared allegiance to islamic state in 2014. but attacks in the sinai worsened after 2013 when sisi led the overthrow of president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.

" charles “chuck” johnson is not the kind of foot soldier in the army of lobbyists that house of representatives speaker paul ryan warned would descend on washington to fight the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s. johnson, 53, with a degree in social work and another from a  theological seminary, heads the national council for adoption, a small organization in alexandria, virginia that represents adoption agencies and adoption lawyers. despite a relative lack of clout, parents of adopted children and adoption advocates beat back a minor change in the tax code that would have removed a tax credit to help cover the costs of adoption. politics in washington favors the moneyed and the connected, especially big business and special interest groups rich enough to employ legions of lobbyists to advocate on their behalf.  but many of the taxpayers affected by president donald trump’s tax overhaul have little or no influence on congress, where republicans are looking to end a host of tax credits and deductions for medical expenses, moving expenses and alimony in order to pay for their big tax cuts. the bill will cut corporate tax, provide a tax holiday for corporations’ overseas profits and cut the tax rate for the wealthy. “everyone in corporate america had an army ready and in place to push for simplifying the tax code,” said michaela sims stewart, president of the lobbying firm sims strategies.  in contrast, parents of adopted children “naturally came together” to form a “small but mighty group,” said stewart.  stewart also happens to be a spokeswoman for adoption tax credit working group, which brought together a host of organizations, some with strong republican and conservative ties, to pressure the house leadership to drop the change. part of the tax code since 1998, the adoption tax credit was used by nearly 74,000 people in 2014, according to the internal revenue service.  the adoption advocates started a social media campaign on facebook and twitter to alert parents of the change. “we expected adoptive families to rally in support, but when groups like focus on the family, national right to life, u.s. conference of catholic bishops, prominent clergy such as russell moore, and even the lgbt community joined, the media took an interest,” said johnson, of the national council for adoption. with the publicity, pro family republican politicians were suddenly in the position of having to explain the elimination of what the coalition had successfully cast as a pro child policy. the house proposal was dropped nov. 2 and the senate didn’t even bother to make it part of its version of the tax bill. while adoptive parents were ultimately successful in their fight, others have struggled to be heard. graduate students staged walkouts on dozens of campuses this week to protest one republican proposal that would increase their tax burden. it would require graduate students to pay taxes on tuition payments that are waived by their university as if it were income. in other words, the students would be required to pay taxes on money they never had to begin with.      few of the republican proposals to end deductions or tax credits will yield a lot of money for a government that spends $4 trillion a year. ending alimony deductions, a benefit in the tax code since 1954, might raise $8.3 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by congress’s joint committee on taxation. no longer letting teachers write off $250 of what they shell out of their own pocket for classroom supplies might yield $2.1 billion over the same period, the committee says. the change affecting adoption might bring in less than $50 million over the next decade. the committee did not break out what ending medical deductions would yield. even though the stakes are high for them, advocates for people with disabilities and chronic diseases say they lagged in fighting cuts in medical expense deductibility, as well as removing a tax break to companies that make handicap accessible structural changes, and a tax credit for businesses that hire people with disabilities. the tax breaks were not explicitly for people with disabilities, and the advocates had not expected they would be in congress’s crosshairs.  these less than powerful voices may yet be heard as the senate prepares to vote on its bill this week. they may get another chance when the house and senate compromise on a single piece of legislation to vote on and pass to trump.

" the white house on friday distanced itself from a news report it  embraced a day earlier that britain’s top secret eavesdropping agency monitored trump tower at former u.s. president barack obama’s behest. the white house had cited the report by a fox news analyst as it sought to defend president donald trump’s charge that obama’s administration wiretapped him during the 2016 election. over the past two weeks, trump and his aides have pressed the claim in numerous ways, including suggestions that trump may have been monitored through microwaves and television sets. the white house has provided no proof to support trump’s allegation and the heads of u.s. house and senate intelligence panels, including from trump’s republican party, have rejected it.  here is a chronology of the administration’s assertions: march 4: in a series of early morning tweets, trump accuses obama of having his wires tapped and calls him a “bad (or sick) guy.” trump spokesman sean spicer says the white house’s top lawyer was examining options for pursuing the claim. march 5: the white house cites reports of potentially politically motivated investigations, and says trump wanted the congressional intelligence committees to examine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. march 6: spicer suggests monitoring may have been broader than a wire tap, might have been conducted under a secret foreign intelligence eavesdropping warrant and that “there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources” that such surveillance occurred. march 7: spicer says while there is no new proof of trump’s allegation, the president has absolutely no regrets about his tweets and that he was “not walking anything back or regretting.” march 12: senior white house adviser kellyanne conway suggests in an interview with the bergen county record newspaper that the monitoring may have been conducted through television sets or “microwaves that turn into cameras.” march 13: conway says her comments the previous day were misconstrued but continues to air the allegation about the president and wiretapping at trump tower. spicer says trump’s charges were based on reporting by a number of news organizations, including fox, the bbc and the new york times. trump’s use of the word “wiretapping ... spans a whole host of surveillance types of options,” spicer says. march 14: spicer says trump is extremely confident the justice department would find evidence proving his allegation. march 15: republican and democratic leaders of the house intelligence committee say they have seen no evidence of wiretapping. the white house defends trump’s allegation, and trump says in a fox news interview that, “we will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasn’t been submitted as of yet. but it’s potentially a very serious situation.” march 16: the republican and democratic leaders of the senate intelligence committee, and house speaker paul ryan, separately say there is no proof of trump’s charge. spicer says there is no question that surveillance techniques were used. he cites a litany of news reports to justify the allegation. they include an assertion by a fox news analyst, former new jersey judge andrew napolitano, that he had been told by unidentified intelligence officials that obama obtained transcripts of trump’s conversations from government communications headquarters, or gchq, the british agency that monitors overseas communications. march 17: the administration backs away from the fox news report after the british government said it was assured by the white house that it would not repeat napolitano’s allegation, dubbed “nonsense” by a gchq spokesman. “mr. spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story,” said a white house official.

" ride hailing app uber [uber.ul] said on monday it was joining a global public transport association to improve mobility in the cities it operates in, although north america s largest public transit union said there was no place for the u.s. company. uber s move to join the international association of public transportation (uitp) is part of a drive by uber to improve its relationships with local authorities after a series of regulatory and legal setbacks. uitp represents public transport providers around the world, including transport for london (tfl)   which in september stripped uber of its operating license. scandal hit uber has just had to reassure authorities it is changing the way it does business after the disclosure of a massive data breach cover up that has prompted investigations from regulators around the world. andrew salzberg, uber s head of transportation policy and research, said aligning the company with public transport authorities was a good way to make uber a better partner for cities. uber, currently valued at $69 billion, has been testing a more collaborative approach to regulators under its new ceo dara khosrowshahi in a shift away from a more aggressive culture under former ceo travis kalanick.  one of the big emphases that dara has made ... is that we want to be better partners for the cities we operate in,  salzberg said. uber said it would work on a series of training sessions with uitp aimed at connecting people better with public transport. salzberg said the company also wanted to help reduce congestion on roads by encouraging people to move to shared modes of transport. alain flausch, secretary general of uitp, said uber s decision to join the association was a sign that the company wanted a better relationship with regulators. flausch said he had told members of uitp that he would check the company stuck to its promises.  it s a work in progress and having uber join is a good sign. of course they keep their business model but ... they need to be a bit more flexible and open to talking,  he told reuters. however, larry hanley, president of the amalgamated transit union (atu), which represents public transit employees in the united states and canada, said uber should start being a better partner to the cities it operates in by  paying a living wage to their drivers who call those cities home.   public transportation should serve the public good, and until uber demonstrates that they meet that standard they have no business being a part of the international association of public transport,  hanley said.

"salem, n.c. (reuters)   transgender people barred under a new north carolina law from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity filed a federal lawsuit on monday, arguing the measure was discriminatory and threatened their personal safety. north carolina last week became the first state to enact a measure requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate, according to the national conference of state legislatures.  “by singling out lgbt people for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against transgender people into state law, (the state) violates the most basic guarantees of equal treatment and the u.s. constitution,” said the lawsuit, which was filed by the american civil liberties union and lambda legal. the state’s republican dominated legislature passed the law during a one day special session called to repeal a charlotte city ordinance that would have allowed bathroom choice based on gender identity versus sex at birth. state lawmakers also voted to prohibit local governments from enacting anti discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  the actions drew swift criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups and companies including american airlines, apple and google.  in response to the law, the mayors of san francisco and seattle as well as new york governor andrew cuomo have barred non essential, publicly funded government travel to the state, saying the law is discriminatory. north carolina senate leader phil berger and house speaker tim moore, both republicans, said they were confident the law would be upheld in court. “this lawsuit takes this debate out of the hands of voters and instead attempts to argue with a straight face that there is a previously undiscovered ‘right’ in the u.s. constitution for men to use women’s bathrooms and locker rooms,” they said in a joint statement. state lawmakers have warned of the dangers that could result from men sharing bathrooms with women and young girls. but transgender plaintiffs said they would be vulnerable because making known they are transgender puts them at high risk of violence. “this is about more than restrooms. this is about my job, my community and my ability to get safely through my day,” said joaquin carcano, a 27 year old university employee who is a plaintiff in the suit.  chase strangio, a staff attorney with the national aclu’s lgbt project, said on monday the new law on bathroom access has “no clear enforcement mechanism.”  opponents of the law criticized republican governor pat mccrory, who is seeking re election in november, for signing the sweeping legislation on the same day it was introduced. they noted the weeks of debate and review given to a georgia measure that sought to strengthen legal protections for gay marriage opponents before republican governor nathan deal signaled on monday he would veto it. “by contrast, what happened here in north carolina was a farce,” said chris brook, legal director for the aclu of north carolina.

" thousands of indonesians, led by islamist groups, held a rally near the myanmar embassy in jakarta on wednesday to protest against the treatment of rohingya muslims and demand the snapping of ties between the two countries.    indonesia has the world s largest population of muslims and there have been several anti myanmar protests in jakarta and the malaysian capital of kuala lumpur over the treatment of buddhist majority myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingyas.  roads were blocked and barbed wire barriers put up around the embassy, in a leafy district of the capital, which was patrolled by police in riot gear who set up water cannons. some protesters chanted  allahu akbar  (god is greatest), while others shouted slogans such as  slaughter myanmar  and  burn the embassy . buddhists should respect muslims in myanmar in the same way that muslims respected buddhists in indonesia, one speaker told the crowd, using a loud hailer.    almost 125,000 rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between rohingya insurgents and the army in myanmar s northwestern state of rakhine. tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring bangladesh. indonesian foreign minister retno marsudi met myanmar leader aung san suu kyi and top security officials this week to urge a halt to the bloodshed. marsudi also visited dhaka, capital of bangladesh on tuesday, to offer help in tackling the crisis. some protesters at the jakarta rally called for the expulsion of the myanmar ambassador over the issue, as well as for diplomatic ties between the two countries to be severed. myanmar embassy staff would be safe, however, said a foreign ministry spokesman, armanatha nasir.   it is the responsibility of the host countries to ensure the safety of all diplomatic missions and their personnel,  the spokesman said.  indonesia takes this responsibility seriously.   at the weekend, a petrol bomb was thrown at the embassy causing a small fire. indonesian police have also pledged to bar islamist groups from staging a rally on friday at the borobudur buddhist temple in central java to protest against the treatment of myanmar s rohingya muslims.

" u.s. senators unveiled legislation on wednesday providing federal aid to help states fix water infrastructure in the wake of flint, michigan’s crisis over lead tainted drinking water.  senators james inhofe, an oklahoma republican, and debbie stabenow, a michigan democrat, and others introduced the measure providing $100 million to a revolving fund states can tap if they have drinking water problems. the funding in the agreement is paid for by cuts from the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loans for auto companies, aimed to speed development of electric cars and other technologies. inhofe called it a “failed program” that hasn’t been used in more than a year and has only issued five loans since 2008. it was unclear whether the measure would be attached to a wide ranging energy bill that failed to advance early this month or whether the senators would try to pass it as a separate bill.  under the plan, states must first explain how the money would be spent, according to details of the agreement. if they do not use the aid in 18 months, it would return to the federal government.  “this is not a blank check,” according to a document explaining the deal. thousands of children in flint, a predominantly african american city of 100,000, are believed to have consumed dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water after a state appointed emergency manager directed the city to switch from detroit’s drinking water supply to the flint river. lead is a neurotoxin that can harm brain development in children.  under the deal, flint and the states would also have access to $70 million in a credit subsidy under a federal program called the water infrastructure finance and innovation authority, or wifia. congress conceived the wifia to help lower borrowing costs for municipal water projects. the federal program acts as a loan guarantee, rather than a grant, and is aimed at bringing borrowing costs in line with u.s. government bond rates. some critics say local governments need direct federal aid, not borrowing support, to improve infrastructure. there would also be $50 million in aid available for national use for a childhood lead poisoning prevention program, a health registry and other items. earlier this month, michigan lawmakers had at first opposed getting funding from the advanced vehicles program, saying it would hurt auto workers.

that “all he does is insult everybody ... women, black people, white people, rich, poor. he’s an idiot.” he considered clinton, but was concerned by the scandal over her handling of classified material on a private email server as secretary of state. “i hated both of them, so i just said, ‘the hell with it,’” mcandrew said. his wife, also a life long democrat, went to the polls without him   and voted republican.  “first time ever,” he said. trump’s ability to flip reliably democratic counties like northampton helped drive his victory in the presidential election this week. it was critical to his win in pennsylvania and other rust belt states, a bulwark in the democrats’ electoral strategy for winning the white house, and it helped fuel his victories in critical swing states, such as florida and north carolina. it’s not that trump’s economic populism and “america first” messages generated widespread enthusiasm; he won some of those counties with far fewer votes than mitt romney captured as the republican nominee in 2012. nationwide, trump’s 59.7 million votes are about 1.2 million behind the 60.9 million romney got when he lost four years ago, based on initial projections. but clinton’s troubles holding on to democratic voters were far more stark. some crossed party lines for trump or backed an independent.  many just stayed home.  clinton won the popular vote with 59.9 million votes, 6 million fewer than the 65.9 million obama won in 2012. and her weakness in traditionally democratic areas helped cost her the electoral college that chooses the winner of the election. clinton came across as a status quo candidate unlikely to shake up the washington establishment, says mike sly, 74, a retiree and independent voter in pinellas county, florida, who backed obama in 2012 and voted for trump this year. clinton’s message failed to convince him that she would address his concerns about the state of the economy and rising health insurance premiums under obama’s affordable care act. the race “came down to basically what change do i think is going to happen, and how i think it is going to happen,” sly says. “i felt that hillary really carried too much baggage to be trusted.” clinton’s loss in florida, a key battleground state, stemmed partly from her inability to hold voters like sly in white, middle  and working class areas that previously went democrat. in vote rich pinellas, a beach community popular with retirees in the tampa bay region, trump won 48 percent of the vote, besting clinton’s 47 percent. in 2012, obama won 52 percent. nationally, initial projections show low voter turnout of just over 55 percent, the worst since the contested election of 2000, when republican george w. bush defeated then democratic vice president al gore. in obama’s first victory, turnout was more than 62 percent. clinton beat trump among black and hispanic voters, but her effort to forge a winning coalition by leveraging that strength in diverse, urban areas was upended by trump’s strength among whites. meanwhile, trump still managed to hold roughly the same level of minority support that romney got in 2012. the pattern held true not only in rural areas, but also in many suburbs, particularly in the rust belt and the south, that tipped towards obama in the previous two presidential races. “it was pretty much a base election, but one group was better at turning out their voters than the other,” says susan macmanus, a university of south florida political science professor. in gates county, north carolina, trump’s vows to crack down on illegal immigration and police muslim communities for radicalism resonated, says eric j. earhart, 49, pastor of the evangelical upper room assembly church. “there has been a definite shift over the past eight years away from us being a judeo christian nation,” earhart adds, and many congregants worry about that. the rural county of 12,000 people went for obama in 2012 with 52 percent of the vote, but it flipped into trump’s column in this year’s race, giving him 53 percent. thomas hill, 38, chairman of the gates county republican party, says voters also were attracted to trump’s blunt speaking and his pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs that went overseas.  trump’s economic message, which included a promise to kill free trade agreements that are unpopular among many working class voters in industrial areas, also succeeded in macomb county, michigan, a predominantly white area north of detroit. the number of voters casting ballots in the county jumped by more than 14,000 over 2012, and trump captured 53 percent of the vote to clinton’s 42 percent. four years ago, obama won the county with just under 52 percent of the vote.  “you’ve got a lot of blue collar workers here (and) ... a lot of union guys, and they went republican,” says david phair, 59, a construction worker and trump voter who didn’t cast a ballot in 2012. “they’re tired of politicians.” phair also liked trump’s promise to end illegal immigration. “i’m looking forward to how he’s going to handle illegal aliens.” in pennsylvania, northampton county and neighboring lehigh county, once reliant on steel companies, have bounced back from the industry’s decline. in bethlehem, which straddles the two counties, new development has mushroomed around the old steel mill, including a sands casino resort with 2,400 employees.  e commerce companies, white collar firms and big corporations, such as olympus, the japanese imaging giant, have also  moved to the region. lehigh and northampton counties have a larger share of households than the state as a whole that earn more than $75,000, about 36 percent. all that suggests ripe country for clinton. but the counties also are whiter and older than the country as a whole.  and trump dominated voting among older whites. around the table where mcandrew has a weekly poker game in the basement of the united steel workers office in bethlehem, the retired men of the city’s steel mills have different opinions on why clinton failed to match obama’s success in the region. but they agree that she didn’t offer a compelling message. among the five at the table, all lifelong democrats, only three cast votes for clinton. “she was going to continue everything the way it is and a lot of people think there are things that need to be changed,” says ken rayden, 80, who voted for clinton, but mainly out of party loyalty. “she didn’t show the people anything new.” ",0
" the u.s. decision to supply weapons to ukraine is dangerous as it will encourage kiev to use force in eastern ukraine, russian officials said on saturday. the u.s. state department said on friday the united states would provide ukraine with  enhanced defensive capabilities   as kiev battles russian backed separatists in the eastern part of the country. u.s. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the weapons included javelin anti tank missiles. washington has argued in the past that such weapons would help stabilize the situation and cannot effectively be used to take territory.  ukrainian president petro poroshenko said on facebook on saturday the weapons would be used to protect ukrainian soldiers and civilians. supplies of any weapons now encourage those who support the conflict in ukraine to use the  force scenario,  russia s ria state news agency cited deputy foreign minister grigory karasin as saying on saturday. franz klintsevich, a member of the upper house of the russian parliament s security committee, said kiev would consider arms supplies as support of its actions, interfax news agency reported.  americans, in fact, directly push ukrainian forces to war,  klintsevich said. since moscow s annexation of crimea in 2014, ukraine and russia have been at loggerheads over a war in eastern ukraine between pro russian separatists and ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. poroshenko said in his facebook post that he had confirmed the weapons deal with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, calling it  a transatlantic vaccination against the russian virus of aggression.   american weapons in the hands of ukrainian soldiers are not for offensive, but for stronger rebuff of the aggressor, protection of ukrainian soldiers and civilians, as well as for effective self defense in accordance with article 51 of the un charter,  poroshenko said.  kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which russia denies. the russian foreign ministry said the u.s. decision once again undermines the minsk agreements, tass state news agency reported on saturday. the agreements, intended to end the fighting in ukraine, were signed by ukraine, russia, germany and france in the belarussian capital in early 2015.

" saudi arabia and the united states on sunday played down media reports that washington had decided to limit military support, including planned arms sales to the kingdom, over its war in yemen. saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir said that riyadh had not been officially informed of such decisions, which he described as contradicting the reality, while visiting u.s. secretary of state john kerry suggested the issue related more to a long procurement process than restrictions on military support. u.s. officials have said washington decided to curb backing for saudi arabia’s campaign in yemen, including halting the supply of some precision guided munitions, because of concerns over widespread civilian casualties.  yemen’s 20 month old war has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered humanitarian crises, including chronic food shortages, in the poorest country in the arabian peninsula. jubeir, speaking in arabic, told a joint news conference with kerry: “this news that has been leaked contradicts reality. the reality is that converting regular bombs to smart bombs would be welcome because smart bombs are more accurate. “the kingdom has received nothing official from the american government in this regard,” he said in answer to a question on reported delays of u.s. weapons supplies. kerry appeared to play down the reports of delays to weapons supplies, suggesting procurement was often a slow process, and adding he had worked hard to move sales “forward”. kerry also said that he agreed in talks with jubeir and other gulf arab foreign ministers to push for a “cessation of hostilities, which we all will work on in the next several days with hopes that within two weeks it might be possible to achieve it ...”. saudi arabia has been leading an arab coalition that has been fighting against iran aligned houthis who forced yemeni president abd rabbu mansour hadi from power nearly two years ago. the conflict has displaced some three million people, according to the united nations.  “our immediate priority is to end the bloodshed and that’s why reestabilishing the ceasefire is so critical,” kerry told the news conference.  “we think we’ve found the path to move forward and invite the parties, president hadi, the houthis and the supporters of both sides to take advantage of this moment to try to come to the table and to try to frame an end,” he added. saudi arabia has been subjected to frequent cross border raids and missile attacks by the houthi movement. responding to a question on whether saudi arabia was reconsidering its investment strategy over risks in the united states related to donald trump’s election and potential lawsuits under the u.s. justice against sponsors of terrorism act, known as jasta, jubeir said: “the kingdom of saudi arabia has tremendous investments in the united states and we review those investments on a regular basis. there are issues associated with risk, but our objective is to increase those investments. we won’t decrease them.” jubeir also said he had spent time in the united states recently to try to get to know the policies and positions of the next administration.   he also said he had dealt with congress to press for amendments of the jasta law, which grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u.s. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the saudi government.

" the north korean soldier critically wounded when making a dash to the south last month may have cheated death, but even as his health improves, he is months if not years away from finding a normal life in south korea, officials and other defectors say.  the transition to life in the democratic and prosperous south can be difficult for any defector from the isolated and impoverished north, let alone for a soldier from an elite border unit with potentially actionable military intelligence and a high profile that may complicate efforts to blend in. the 24 year old soldier, identified only by his surname oh, has been released from intensive care after being shot five times during his daring defection, but is still battling a hepatitis b infection which could delay his transfer to a military hospital for some time, doctors said.  as active duty soldier defectors have up to date information, the intelligence agencies would question the soldiers and see if anything needs to be addressed in our military s operation and combat plans,  a current south korean government official involved in resettling north korean refugees told reuters. oh will likely be under the protection of south korea s spy agency, the national intelligence service (nis), and then be offered work such as code cracking in the military or related agencies, a former senior south korean government official said.   the decision would be made after a comprehensive assessment on what he means to national security, the level of information he has, and whether he would be capable of mingling with other defectors at the resettlement center,  the former official said. defections by active duty soldiers are extremely rare, once a year or less. intelligence agencies are keen to question oh, who was stationed in the joint security area near the heavily fortified border, according to south korean lawmakers briefed by the nis.  doctors have asked that officials wait until oh is fully recovered both physically and emotionally before they begin questioning. given his high profile escape and status as a member from an elite border unit, oh will likely be given more personalized assistance, away from other north korean defectors at the hanawon resettlement center, the former south korean official said.  most defectors undergo security questioning by the national intelligence service for a few days up to several months in extreme cases, before being moved to the hanawon resettlement center.  there they receive mandatory three month education on life in the capitalist south, from taking public transportation to opening a bank account to creating an email address.  it s where you would get to see the outside world for the first time, as they take you out to meet people on the streets and learn how to access the social service network. these days, you can also do a homestay with an ordinary south korean family,  said ji seong ho, a 35 year old defector who heads now, action and unity for human rights (nauh), a group that rescues and resettles north korean refugees.  such training can be more useful for some people than others, said kim jin soo, a 29 year old former member of the north korean secret police who defected to the south in 2011.  looking back, it would ve been really useful if they taught more realistic things even though it might discourage people, like how to prepare for a job fair and find a suitable workplace and why it s important to lose the north korean accent,  he said.   fresh off hanawon, you re like a one year old baby. but those are the things that would pose a real obstacle when you actually go out there on your own,  said kim, who now works at a advertising firm in seoul.  after leaving hanawon, central and local governments provide defectors 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year   barely a fifth of south korea s annual average income   as well as support in housing, education and job training. police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security.  oh may have potential value to the south korean government or organizations that try to highlight conditions in north korea, but it will be up to him whether he wants to live a life in the limelight, said sokeel park, country director for liberty in north korea, which helps north korean refugees.  if he has any mind to get involved in that kind of stuff then there will be all kinds of media or non governmental organizations who would fall over themselves to give him that platform,  said park.   but if he makes a good recovery and he chooses to blend it, then he s just another young guy with a vague back story.  graphic: defector braves hail of bullets reut.rs/2zaudrn ",0
" barely two days into crafting a new bill to roll back obamacare, u.s. senate republicans were already on the defensive on tuesday over the absence of any women in their core working group. after a meeting of the senate healthcare group, lawmakers were bombarded with questions as to why no women were named to the 13 man panel. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell tried to explain. “the working group that counts is all 52 of us,” mcconnell told reporters, referring to all 52 republican senators in the 100 member chamber. “nobody is being excluded based upon gender ... everybody’s at the table. everybody.” democrats pounced. republican men are negotiating “a secret healthcare plan, which i really hope is not happening in the men’s locker room,” said senator patty murray, a member of the democratic leadership from washington state.      if the criticism was any sign of what lies ahead as senators try to improve on a rollback bill passed on thursday by house of representatives republicans, it could be a long road ahead. dismantling the parts of president barack obama’s signature healthcare law that they dislike and preserving other parts of it is proving to be a difficult task for president donald trump and his fellow republicans. a house of representatives’ plan for doing that, approved last week amid much drama, faces an uncertain future in the senate. some republicans eye drafting a similar senate bill by mid summer, possibly with the involvement of democrats. others indicate the house bill requires major surgery and that the effort to replace the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, could take months.  regardless of timing, two decisive factors will come into sharper focus soon. one is voter reaction to the house bill, now being voiced in town hall events being hosted nationwide by house members in their home districts. the other factor is an expected analysis by the non partisan congressional budget office of how many million americans would lose their health insurance coverage under the house bill, if it became law, and how it would affect the u.s. budget deficit. both the cbo analysis and the town hall events have the potential to do damage to the house legislation, which trump hailed as a triumph just days ago. senators are already talking about major changes in the house bill concerning medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and tax subsidies for healthcare coverage. trying to get past the controversy over the absence of women on the healthcare panel, senate republicans said they expected to devote much time to healthcare in the near future.  “i don’t think we’re going to be talking about much else other than healthcare at least three days a week with all members of our conference present,” said senator john cornyn, the no. 2 republican. cornyn said senators would start with the house bill. “if we have to make modifications in order to pass it, we’ll make those modifications and work out the differences with the house.” medicaid was the topic at the senate working group meeting  tuesday. the house bill would cut federal spending on medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. but some republicans want any reductions to be more gradual, and trump made a campaign pledge not to cut the program. “there ought to be a glide path where you do not have a cliff that the house provides in 2020,” when the expansion of medicaid under obamacare is abruptly ended, said senator rob portman of ohio. but other republicans said cutbacks were important to save taxpayer money. “the public wants every dime you can give them. let’s face it, once you get them on the dole, they are going to take every dime they can. we’ve got to find some way of getting things under control, or this country and your future’s going to be gone,” said republican senator orrin hatch, a member of the healthcare working group.

" u.s. spy agencies have told congress that hillary clinton’s home computer server contained some emails that should have been treated as “top secret” because their wording matched sections of some of the government’s most highly classified documents, four sources familiar with the agency reports said.     the two reports are the first formal declarations by u.s. spy agencies detailing how they believe clinton violated government rules when highly classified information in at least 22 email messages passed through her unsecured home server.     the state department has already acknowledged that the emails contained top secret intelligence, though it says they were not marked that way. it has not previously been clear if the emails contained full classified documents or only some information from them.     the agencies did not find any top secret documents that passed through clinton’s server in their full version, the sources from congress and the government’s executive branch said.      however, the agency reports found some emails included passages that closely tracked or mirrored communications marked “top secret,” according to the sources, who all requested anonymity. in some cases, additional classification markings meant access was supposed to be limited to small groups of specially cleared officials.      under the law and government rules, u.s. officials and contractors may not transmit any classified information   not only documents   outside secure, government controlled channels. such information should not be sent even through the government’s .gov email network.     the front runner for the democratic nomination for president and former secretary of state has insisted she broke no rules. clinton’s lawyer, david kendall, did not respond to a request for comment. clinton campaign spokespeople did not respond to multiple requests for comment.      two sources said some of the top secret material was related to the cia’s campaign of drone strikes against islamist militants in the middle east and south asia.      that campaign has been widely reported by reuters and other media outlets, but it officially is classified as a “top secret/special access program” (sap), meaning only a limited number of people whose names are on a special list are allowed to learn details about it.     one source said the reports identified some information in messages on clinton’s server that came from human sources, such as confidential cia informants, and some from technical systems, such as spy satellites or electronic eavesdropping.     the clinton campaign criticized the state department’s decision last month to withhold the 22 emails containing top secret information from the public, blaming it on “bureaucratic infighting” and “over classification run amok.”     “as we have previously made clear, we are not going to speak to the content of the emails,” a state department official said on wednesday when asked about the intelligence agency reports.     clinton’s use of a private server in her new york home for her government work is being investigated by the federal bureau of investigation, the state department’s and spy community’s internal watchdogs and several republican controlled congressional committees.     two of the sources told reuters that one of the reports on the emails came from the cia. three sources said the other report came from the national geospatial intelligence agency (nga), which analyzes u.s. spy satellite intelligence.     a spokesman for nga did not immediately respond to requests for comment. cia spokespeople declined to comment.        the two spy agencies’ reports were sent to congress in the past few weeks by the intelligence community inspector general, an official government watchdog for multiple spy agencies.     the inspector general’s office has confirmed that it requested the reports from two intelligence agencies, but didn’t identify them.      it was unclear what the congressional committees that received the classified reports, the house and senate intelligence and foreign relations panels, will do with them. the contents cannot be discussed publicly. the committees requested intelligence reports in connection with their efforts to ensure that government secrets are appropriately protected.

" south africa s president jacob zuma has filed an appeal against a court ruling that his appointment of a state prosecutor to decide whether to reinstate corruption charges against him was not valid, local media reported on thursday. the high court ruled last week that zuma s appointment of head prosecutor shaun abrahams should be set aside immediately and that deputy president cyril ramaphosa should appoint a new public prosecutor within 60 days. the ruling was among a series of judicial blows to his administration, which has been hit by a series of scandals. zuma filed papers saying that people exercise presidential powers at the same time, according to television station enca.  zuma s spokesman could not immediately comment. the national prosecuting authority (npa) has also said it will appeal the ruling. in october the supreme court of appeal upheld an earlier decision by a lower court that the nearly 800 corruption charges filed against zuma before he became president be reinstated.  it then fell to abrahams, appointed by zuma, to decide whether or not the npa would pursue a case against him. the charges against zuma relate to a 30 billion rand  ($2.22 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s and have amplified calls for zuma to step down before his term as president ends in 2019.

" the mississippi ports of pascagoula and gulfport signed agreements in cuba on monday with an eye to future business and with a republican u.s. senator from the state looking on, despite concerns president donald trump might backtrack on improved relations. senator thad cochran is the only republican among five u.s. senators and a u.s. representative on a three day visit to the communist run caribbean island to discuss relations and explore business opportunities. the agreements were signed during a business forum to explore future trade attended by cochran. “there is great potential for business between these ports and cuba due to the geographical proximity and the excellent fluvial and maritime ways mississippi has,” state run media quoted maria de la luz b’hamel, director of commercial policy with the united states at the cuban ministry of foreign trade and investment, as saying. the event was closed to foreign journalists. the congressional delegation arrived on sunday and is being led by democratic senator patrick leahy of vermont, who was instrumental in efforts to normalize relations under former democratic president barack obama. cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile u.s. detente with cuba will fare under the new trump administration. the republican president has threatened to scrap moves to normalize relations, one of obama’s signature foreign policy initiatives, if he does not get “a better deal.” port authorities along the u.s. southern coast are strong proponents of increased trade and travel with cuba, and some have expressed interest in using mariel, located on the northwest coast of cuba, as a transshipment hub. similar agreements were signed last month with virginia, louisiana and alabama. the florida ports of everglades and palm beach had also been planning to sign deals, but balked after republican state governor rick scott threatened to cancel their funding if they did business with the “cuban dictatorship.”  ",0

" if angela merkel becomes german chancellor again, nearly half of voters would want her to quit her term early, according to a poll offering a rare sign that domestic support for europe s most influential leader may be waning. merkel s conservatives won a national election in september, setting her up for a fourth stint in office. but they bled support to the far right, and talks on a three way coalition with the greens and the pro business free democrats collapsed in november. merkel is now pinning her hopes on cutting a deal with the center left social democrats (spd), who finished second in the election but have so far given a lukewarm response to the idea of renewing the  grand coalition  that governed germany between 2013 and 2017. the yougov survey, commissioned by germany s dpa agency and published in wednesday s die welt newspaper, showed 47 percent of respondents wanted merkel to step aside before 2021, when her fourth term would end   up from 36 percent in a poll taken at the beginning of october. by contrast, 36 percent want her to serve a full four years, compared to 44 percent three months ago. the spd, which lost ground among voters after the coalition with merkel, has been reluctant to commit to a re run as it looks to keep a skeptical rank and file on board.   spd foreign minister sigmar gabriel, a former leader of the party, adopted a tough tone on wednesday in top selling daily bild.  if the chancellery continues to reject all the proposals for eu reform, there will be no coalition with the spd,  he told the paper. the spd s current leader, martin schulz, has championed deeper euro zone reform, calling for a united states of europe by 2025. gabriel also said the conservatives needed to reform the health system to close the gap between private and state care. an insa poll in bild put merkel s conservatives up 2 points at 33 percent and the spd down 0.5 percent at 20.5 percent. the far right alternative for germany (afd) which,  capitalizing on voters  fears about growing inequality and the impact on germany of europe s migrant crisis, entered parliament for the first time in september, was down 1 point at 13 percent. many commentators have suggested the afd would make gains if new elections were held due to a failure on merkel s part to form a government. merkel s conservatives and the spd have said they will start exploratory coalition talks on jan. 7.

" the anti nuclear group which won the 2017 nobel peace prize accused the united states, britain and france on wednesday of snubbing its disarmament work by planning to send only second rank diplomats to the award ceremony next month.  it s some kind of protest against the nobel peace prize,  beatrice fihn, director of the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons (ican), told reuters of a plan by the three nations to send only deputy chiefs of mission.  they like their nuclear weapons very much and don t like it when we try to ban them,  she said, accusing the three of wrongly opposing ican s work  when north korea and the united states are exchanging threats to use nuclear weapons . the annual december 10 nobel prize ceremony in oslo, attended by king harald and queen sonja, is the highlight of the diplomatic calendar in norway. the prize comprises a diploma, a gold medal and a cheque for $1.1 million. olav njoelstad, director of the norwegian nobel institute, confirmed the three nations would send only deputies. he said the awards committee always preferred to see chiefs of mission.  that being said, we are neither surprised nor offended by the fact that sometime foreign governments prefer to stay away from the ceremony in protest or, as in this case, because they prefer to be represented by their deputy chiefs of mission,  he told reuters.  the nobel peace prize is, after all, a political prize. the norwegian nobel committee takes notice of the joint decision of the british, french and u.s. embassies,  he said. the british embassy confirmed it was sending a deputy ambassador and said in a statement  the uk is committed to the long term goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  we share this goal with our partners across the international community including u.s. and france.  the u.s. and french embassies were not immediately available for comment. last month, u.s. president donald trump nominated kenneth braithwaite to the post of ambassador in oslo, currently held by an acting ambassador. ican, a coalition of grassroots non government organizations in more than 100 nations, campaigned successfully for a u.n. treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in july this year. but the agreement is not signed by   and would not apply to   any of the states that already have nuclear arms, which include the united states, russia, china, britain and france, as well as india, pakistan and north korea. israel neither confirms nor denies the widespread assumption that it controls the middle east s only nuclear arsenal. it was not clear whether other nuclear powers would send oslo ambassadors to the nobel ceremony.   the absence of ambassadors from the united states, britain and france  is disappointing but at the same time we are focused on getting a majority of states in the world to join this treaty,  fihn said. she said the three nuclear states were exerting pressure on other nations  not to engage in this treaty .

" the head of the syrian opposition s high negotiations committee (hnc) resigned on monday, nearly two years after he was picked to chair the saudi backed umbrella group that brings together the armed and political opposition to president bashar al assad. riyad hijab, a former syrian prime minister under assad, did not explain his reasons for stepping down in a statement posted on social media. the hnc has been the main representative of the syrian opposition since its formation at a meeting in saudi arabia in december, 2015, and has taken part in u.n. led diplomacy aimed at ending the conflict that erupted in 2011. the war has been going assad s way since russia sent its air force to support him militarily in 2015. the damascus government has been steadily regaining control of territory, thanks also to the support of iran backed forces such as lebanon s hezbollah. saudi arabia is due to host an  expanded  conference for the syrian opposition this month, aiming to unify its position ahead of more u.n. backed peace talks, the saudi state news agency spa reported last week. previous rounds of geneva peace talks have failed to make headway towards a resolution of the war.

" europe s top human rights organization asked italy for more information on its work intercepting migrants at sea, warning that any moves to return them to libya would break international treaties. the council of europe said on wednesday it had written to the italian government a day after an italian navy ship helped libya s coastguard as it headed off 228 migrants. the coastguard later brought the refugees back to libya. italy would break the european convention on human rights if it had a direct role in returning migrants to libya, where they face  a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,  the council s human rights commissioner, nils muiznieks wrote. italy s interior minister, marco minniti, told ansa news agency the country s ships had never returned migrants to libya after a rescue.  italy s activities are aimed at training, equipping and giving logistical support to the libyan coast guard, not in returns,  he added. andrea doria destroyer provided a libyan coast guard vessel with life jackets as it took migrants off of two rubber boats on sept. 27, according to italy s navy.  the coastguard later posted pictures online of it bringing the migrants back to libya, and said they were taken to detention centers. the united nations has condemned libyan detention centers as  inhuman  because of abuse and a lack of basic hygiene, medical care and even food. the council of europe said on wednesday muiznieks wrote to minniti on sept. 28. italy and the european union have provided training, equipment, repairs and vessels to the libyan coastguard in an effort to bolster its ability to stop to the departure of overcrowded migrant boats. more than 600,000 migrants have set out for europe from libya since 2014. with italy facing an election early next year, minniti has spearheaded efforts to try to provide money and equipment to libyan authorities that agree to fight people smuggling. sea arrivals to italy have fallen 25 percent this year over the same period of 2016 as the libyan coast guard working in tandem with an armed group west of tripoli clamped down on departures. departures from east of tripoli and from tunisia, however, are now on the increase.

"apparently, using thug michael ferguson s mom as a prop at black functions was not enough to be granted the black vote black men for bernie founder bruce carter s mission to restore black communities didn t end when vermont senator bernie sanders lost to hillary clinton in the democratic primary. he opposed hillary clinton and the democratic establishment then because he knew that they didn t represent the minority communities he engaged in politics to fight for.after the leak of internal dnc emails, carter is convinced that the democratic party  rigged  the primary against his candidate and that hillary clinton s democratic party has no intention of changing the policies that led to the destruction of the communities he s working to improve.bruce carter still believes that hillary clinton is the poster child for the kind of cronyism, corruption, and evil that the bernie revolution was built to overthrow. he doesn t believe hillary clinton when she labels donald trump and his supporters as racists because he knows she falsely labeled her opponents in the primary as sexist  bernie bros.  carter s preparing to take the experience, knowledge, and contacts his group built during the primary to campaign against hillary clinton and for donald trump and other republicans in battleground states across the country.bruce carter and black men for bernie are at war with the democratic establishment, whom he says pander for votes but haven t delivered meaningful results to minority communities for decades. carter became politically active to support bernie sanders, who taught him how the establishment s only real constituency was the donor class. when he paired that knowledge with what he knew about the decline in the black and minority neighborhoods he loves, he realized democratic politicians and the media had been lying. bernie inspired us to disrupt the status quo because it only works for the elites and not regular people who are struggling,  carter told breitbart news.  if black communities vote for hillary clinton and democrats in november, nothing will change because democrats will continue to believe they don t have to do anything to earn our votes. carter became one of the most prominent and recognizable supporters of the sanders campaign by traveling the country in a tour bus and fleet of vehicles wrapped with the black men for bernie logo and a picture of sanders being arrested during the civil rights movement. his online videos received millions of views and featured celebrities like mark ruffalo and ice cream makers ben and jerry.this guy knows what he s doing when it comes to rallying the troops to get behind his candidate. watch carter organizing supporters for bernie before hillary cheated him out of the chance to become the democrat party candidate:carter told breitbart news that his greatest awakening of how democrats exploit minority voters came when he learned from the washington post that the democratic party spends less than 2 percent of its campaign resources with minority-owned companies, even though they get better than 90 percent of the black vote. it is a practice that carter calls  political slavery. now black men for bernie are rebranding and again planning to tour the country with an emphasis on battleground states. carter says he s going to organize black and minority communities to vote against hillary clinton and the democratic establishment. donald trump is a business man and a real estate mogul who could provide knowledge and resources to transform urban communities through the development of minority-owned businesses,  carter said.  with this tour, we re going to show mr. trump and republicans that the black and minority communities are ready to work with anyone willing to work with us to build opportunities in businesses, employment, and housing. we don t want welfare, we need opportunity. carter had a lot of ideas when asked about what trump could do to help him win black votes away from the democrats.  when donald trump tells black people, what do you have to lose by voting for me, he s getting close to a message that will work, but it s not quite there yet,  carter explained: we re going to go back to these communities in florida, ohio, pennsylvania, michigan, and across the country to lead people to the facts about the clintons  and democrats  failures with our struggling communities,  carter said:for carter and the black men for bernie, they can t unlearn what they discovered about hillary during the primary.  we know that hillary clinton is for hillary clinton and the rich donors of the clinton foundation,  carter said.  we know that bill and hillary did major damage to our communities the last time they were in the white house. we know they will lie about their opponents by unfairly labeling them sexists and racists and radicals. donald trump isn t a typical politician and he isn t beholden to the same old political powers,  carter continued.  we want to earn our seat at the table in his administration and i think he and the republicans are smart enough to realize that when we deliver them a historic number of minority votes, they better do a better job than the democrats have done or they re never going to get an opportunity like this again. for entire story: breitbart news",1
" russia, turkey and iran are close to finalizing an agreement on creating four de escalation zones in syria, a senior russian negotiator said on thursday. the three sides are discussing details of the agreement at meetings in astana, the capital of kazakhstan, alexander lavrentyev, who leads the russian delegation, told reporters.  our main task at this international meeting on syria is to finalize and establish four de escalation zones,  lavrentyev said.  we are very close to reaching an agreement on creating these four zones.  the meetings, which also involve representatives of the damascus government and some rebel factions, will continue on friday. lavrentyev said the agreement was likely to include provisions on the deployment of monitors   such as military police servicemen   in the four zones and, more specifically, on their borders. the previous round of syrian peace talks in astana in july ended with no agreement after turkey raised objections. russia and iran, which back syrian president bashar al assad s government, and turkey, which supports some of the rebels, have been holding talks in kazakhstan since january and the meeting this week is their sixth.

" democratic white house candidate bernie sanders went on the offensive against front runner hillary clinton on sunday in the most contentious of their four presidential debates, accusing her of cozying up to wall street and misrepresenting his stance on healthcare and guns. reflecting sanders’ rise in opinion polls, the two battled with new urgency over who was best suited to lead democrats in the november election. sanders cast himself as the outsider who would lead a political revolution, while clinton touted her experience and embraced president barack obama’s legacy. in their last televised debate before iowa’s caucuses launch the nominating race on feb. 1, clinton raised questions about the self styled democratic socialist’s positions on wall street reform, healthcare and gun control. sanders pushed back at every turn. he painted clinton as a defender of the status quo who accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees as a former secretary of state from wall street backers. “i don’t take money from big banks. i don’t get personal speaking fees from goldman sachs,” the u.s. senator from vermont said, adding, “i have huge doubts when people receive money from wall street.” he referred to his rising poll numbers in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire, where he has pulled even or ahead of clinton, saying he believed he could expand his number of supporters to include more african american voters. he noted that when his presidential campaign began, clinton was 50 percentage points ahead of him in the polls. “guess what: in iowa, new hampshire, the race is (now) very, very close,” sanders said. the debate followed a week of rising tension between the two leading candidates. sanders was noticeably more animated that in previous debates, sometimes grimacing and shaking his head during clinton’s answers. former maryland governor martin o’malley, who lags badly in polls, was often a bystander although he joined sanders in criticizing clinton’s wall street ties. clinton said she would build on obama’s agenda, accusing sanders of voting to deregulate the financial market in 2000 in a way that led to the central causes of the financial collapse of 2008 that pitched the u.s. economy into a deep recession. clinton tried to undercut sanders’ support among supporters of obama, who remains a popular figure in the democratic party. “he’s criticized president obama for taking donations from wall street. and president obama has led our country out of the great recession,” she said.  “senator sanders called him weak, disappointing, he even in 2011 publicly sought someone to run in a primary against president obama.” clinton pounced on sanders’ “medicare for all” plan that was announced just hours before the debate after clinton had criticized sanders for refusing to explain how he would pay for the proposal. the former secretary of state, former u.s. senator and wife of former president bill clinton said sanders’ healthcare plan would undermine obama’s signature affordable care act at a time when republican legislators were still trying to repeal and replace it. “i have to say i’m not sure whether we’re talking about the plan you introduced tonight or the plan you introduced nine times over 20 years,” she told sanders. “but the fact is we have the affordable care act. ... we have already seen 19 million americans get insurance.” sanders said he wanted to build on the obama law by making health insurance more affordable. “nobody is tearing this up,” he said, referring to the program popularly known as obamacare. “we’re moving forward.” the debate was held across the street from the charleston church where a white gunman killed nine black worshippers in june, and clinton made reference to the incident while accusing sanders of being weak on gun control. she welcomed his decision on saturday night to back a bill in congress rescinding portions of a law giving gunmakers immunity from lawsuits, but said his record showed a more lenient attitude toward the demands of the powerful national rifle association (nra) gun lobby. sanders defended himself, saying he has a strong record on trying to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands and standing up to the nra. sanders supporters watching in manchester, new hampshire, said he seemed more engaged than in past debates. “i thought that bernie was much more prepared,” chris haigh, 66, said. sanders has pulled into a statistical tie with clinton in recent polls in iowa, whose caucuses are the first contest in the race to pick a nominee for the november election. he also leads clinton in the next state to vote, vermont neighbor new hampshire, on feb. 9, according to polls. after those two states, the race moves to nevada and south carolina, which have more diverse voting populations and where polls show clinton leading. on march 1, or “super tuesday”, voters in 11 states, many of them in the south where clinton has big poll leads, will cast primary ballots.

" egyptian police arrested seven people on monday after they were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert, security sources said, in a rare public show of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative muslim country. security sources said the seven were arrested for  promoting sexual deviancy,  a euphemism in egypt for homosexuality, after they were seen on camera raising the rainbow flag at a mashrou  leila concert, a popular lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay. egyptian public prosecutor nabil sadek ordered the state security prosecution to immediately investigate the incident, state news agency mena reported. the public prosecutor has not yet announced a decision on whether formal charges will be filed and a case brought to court. although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. the largest crackdown on homosexuals in egypt took place in 2001, when police raided a floating disco called the queen boat. fifty two men were tried in the case, which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and western governments.

" syrian rebel groups on monday rejected russia s planned sochi conference on syria, saying moscow was seeking to bypass a u.n. based geneva peace process and blaming russia for committing war crimes in the war torn country. in a statement by around 40 rebel groups who include some of the military factions who participated in earlier rounds of geneva peace talks, they said moscow had not put pressure on the syrian government to reach a political settlement.  russia has not contributed one step to easing the suffering of syrians and has not pressured the regime that it claims it is a guarantor by move in any real path towards a solution,  the rebel statement said. russia, which has emerged as the dominant player in syria after a major military intervention over two years ago, received backing from turkey and iran for holding a syrian national dialogue congress in the russian city of sochi on jan. 29 30.  russia is an aggressor country that has committed war crimes against syrians... it stood with the regime militarily and defended its politically and over seven years preventing u.n. condemnation of (syrian president bashar) assad s regime,  the statement said. moscow says it targets militants but rebels and residents say the russian air strikes conducted since a major aerial campaign over two years ago has caused hundreds of civilian casualties in indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas away from the frontline. some rebels said they had not yet made up their mind. u.n. syria envoy staffan de mistura said that russia s plan to convene the congress should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the u.n. led geneva talks on ending the war in syria.

" u.s. president donald trump has re tweeted anti islam videos originally posted by jayda fransen, a leader of a far right british party convicted earlier in november of abusing a muslim woman.  fransen is deputy leader of the anti immigrant britain first group. here are some details about her organization:  britain first was founded in 2011 by leader paul golding with a membership of three individuals. it describes itself as a  patriotic political party and street movement , although critics denounce it as a far right, racist organization.  britain first is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage, traditions, customs and values,  it says on its website.   it wants to deport all illegal immigrants, halt all further immigration, and introduce  a comprehensive ban on the religion of islam  with headscarves being outlawed in public.  anyone found to be promoting the ideology of islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment,  its policy platform states.   it holds protests across the country, usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most, many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues christianity in britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant islam.  golding was a former senior figure in the far right british national party and was elected a local councillor in 2009. in his biography on the group s website it says he was  sent to prison in 2016 for confronting a muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying it s okay for muslims to keep sex slaves .  golding stood for election as london mayor in may 2016, winning 31,372 votes, 1.2 percent of all cast.  fransen, who was elected deputy leader in 2014, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in november 2017, and both she and golding are facing further similar charges.   the group gained prominence in june 2016 when labour lawmaker jo cox was shot dead on the street by a nazi obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting  britain first  during the attack. fransen told reuters the killer had nothing to do with her group.

" illinois governor bruce rauner vowed to pursue a legal challenge against union dues the state collects from non unionized, rank and file government workers despite a u.s. supreme court ruling on tuesday that upheld the practice. in a victory for labor, a 4 4 deadlock by the nation’s high court allowed a federal appeals court opinion to stand against 10 non unionized california public school teachers who contended so called fair share dues should not be withheld from their paychecks if they chose against union membership. but the court move likely does not settle the issue, because nearly identical federal litigation in illinois that rauner helped launch last year remains viable. “our case is winding its way through the courts, and it will get to the supreme court probably at some point in the future,” rauner said during a stop in rural illinois on tuesday. “and we will just continue the fight for the freedom of political expression and the right of free speech for government employees. it’s a fundamental issue.” since taking office in 2015, the first term republican governor has waged war with public sector unions in a bid to weaken their longstanding influence over state politics. during his first month in office, the governor signed an executive order to bar state agencies from withholding fair share dues, which non unionized employees must pay under illinois law and collective bargaining agreements to support non political union activities that benefit all workers. public sector unions sued in illinois state court to block rauner’s executive order from being implemented and persuaded a judge to allow the fees to continue to be collected while the case, which is still pending, was litigated. simultaneously, rauner sued in federal court to challenge the fees, but last may he was dismissed from the case by a judge, who ruled the governor lacked legal standing. three non unionized illinois workers forced to pay between $19.75 and $60.86 in union dues per paycheck were allowed to proceed with their own complaint. a spokesman for the union representing the largest bloc of state workers called tuesday’s supreme court ruling a “win” but acknowledged the illinois case may become the next fair share battlefront. “these attacks are political, and they’re ideological. they’re brought by people who want to rig the economy and our democracy in their favor. they’re not going to stop because they lost this particular challenge. they’ll bring another one,” said anders lindall, a spokesman for afscme council 31.

" iraq won’t take part in any regional or international conflicts, prime minister haider al abadi told state tv on saturday. the comment came after abadi had spoke in a phone call with u.s. president donald trump during which tensions with iran were mentioned. the call was the first between the two leaders.  a political commentator close to abadi, ihsan al shammari, said abadi’s comment addressed the u.s. iranian tensions.   iran has close ties with the shi’ite political elite ruling iraq while washington is providing critical military support to iraqi forces battling islamic state.   “iraq is very keen to preserve its national interests (..)and does not wish to be part of any regional or international conflict which would lead to disasters for the region and for iraq,” abadi said, according to state tv. trump said on friday that iranian president hassan rouhani “better be careful” after the latter was quoted as saying that anyone who speaks to iranians with threats would ‘’regret it.’’ the white house on friday said trump and abadi “spoke to the threat iran presents across the entire region,” in their first phone call since the inauguration of the u.s. president. abadi’s office on friday also gave a readout of the phone call that took place overnight thursday, without specifically mentioning iran.  both readouts stressed the importance of their continued cooperation against islamic state, as the militants are being pushed back in iraq and losing control over mosul, the last major city stronghold under their control in the country. the united states has more than 5,000 troops deployed in iraq and is providing air and ground support in the battle of mosul. iran has also played a major role in the fight against islamic state by arming and training iraqi shi’ite groups collectively known as popular mobilization.    “the iraqi prime minister dr abadi is stressing once again the policy of neutrality and to steer clear from conflicts,’’ political commentator shammari told state tv. the iraqi readout said abadi asked trump to lift the ban on people from his country traveling to the united states.  u.s. courts suspended the restrictions announced end january on entries from iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. trump has said he will keep trying to reinstate them. abadi resisted calls from influential pro iranian shi’ite politicians to retaliate against the ban, at a meeting held on jan. 29, citing iraq’s need for u.s. military support. washington last week ratcheted up pressure on iran, putting sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities days after the white house put tehran “on notice” over a ballistic missile test. iran’s dominant influence in iraqi politics was eroded after islamic state routed the iraqi army commanded then by prime minister nuri al maliki, a close ally of tehran, in 2014.

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said he would dissolve parliament s lower house on thursday for a snap election, seeking a mandate to stick to his tough stance toward a volatile north korea and rebalance the social security system. abe, in power for five years, had been expected to call the election for next month to take advantage of improved support  and disarray in the opposition camp.  i ll demonstrate strong leadership and stand at the forefront to face a national crisis,  abe told reporters, mentioning japan s fast ageing population and north korea.  this is my responsibility as leader and my mission as prime minister.  natsuo yamaguchi, the head of abe s junior coalition partner the komeito party, said he understood the election would be on oct. 22.     abe said he would redirect some revenue from a planned sales tax hike in 2019 to child care and education rather than paying back public debt, although he added he would not abandon fiscal reform. rebalancing the spending would offset the potential negative effect on consumption from the tax rise, he said.  we will turn japan s social security system into one that responds to all generations by boldly diverting policy resources to resolve the two major concerns   child rearing and (elderly) nursing care   that working generations confront,  he said. abe rejected criticism that holding an election would create a political vacuum at a time of rising tension over north korea s missile and nuclear arms program. pyongyang has fired ballistic missiles over japan twice in the last month and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on sept. 3  we must not give in to north korea s threats. by gaining a mandate from the people with this election, i will forge ahead with strong diplomacy,  abe said, adding that now was the time to put more pressure on pyongyang, not open dialogue. abe, whose ratings have risen to around 50 percent from around 30 percent in july, is gambling his ruling bloc can keep its lower house majority even if it loses the two thirds  super majority  needed to achieve his long held goal of revising the post war pacifist constitution to clarify the military s role. he said his goal was for his coalition to retain a majority in the chamber. a weekend survey by the nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters planned to vote for abe s liberal democratic party (ldp) versus 8 percent for the main opposition democratic party and another 8 percent for a new party launched by popular tokyo governor yuriko koike.  the nikkei poll was more positive for abe s prospects than a kyodo news agency survey that showed his ldp garnering 27.7 percent support, with 42.2 percent undecided. abe s image as a strong leader has bolstered his ratings amid the north korea crisis and overshadowed opposition criticism of the premier for suspected cronyism scandals that eroded his support earlier this year. given the results seen in other major developed countries, however, some political analysts are not ruling out the unexpected.  abe s big gamble could yield a big surprise,  veteran independent political analyst minoru morita said. the prime minister had been expected to face a grilling over the cronyism scandals during a session of parliament from thursday and opposition party officials saw the move as a ploy to avoid difficult questions. abe on monday asked his cabinet to compile a 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) economic package by year end to focus on child care, education and encouraging corporate investment. he told public broadcaster nhk that diverting sales tax revenue would make it  impossible  to meet the government s target of balancing japan s budget   excluding debt servicing costs and bond sales   by the year beginning april 2020.   but we are absolutely not lowering the flag of fiscal consolidation,  he said. he said he believed it was necessary to revise the constitution s pacifist article 9 to clarify the military s status but said the wording of a proposed change was up to his party.  the main opposition democratic party is struggling with single digit ratings and much depends on whether it can cooperate with liberal opposition groups. on monday, just hours before abe s election announcement, tokyo governor koike said she would lead a new conservative, reform minded  party of hope  to offer voters an alternative to the ldp.   our ideal is to proceed free of special interests,  koike, a former ldp member, told a news conference. an ldp internal survey showed seats held by the ldp and its coalition partner komeito could fall to 280 from the 323 they now hold, the nikkei reported on saturday. reforms adopted last year will cut the number of lower house seats to 465 from 475.

" at least six people were killed on tuesday when a suicide car bomb ripped through a base used by a local security force in yemen s southern port city of aden, residents said, in an attack claimed by islamic state. dozens of other people, including civilians, were wounded in the attack, which occurred outside a camp used by a local security force organized by the saudi led coalition fighting yemen s houthi rebels. islamist militants have exploited a civil war that began in 92015 to try to expand their influence and gain a foothold in the impoverished country located in the southern arabian peninsula, near the world s top oil exporter, saudi arabia. witnesses described a huge explosion that shook the al mansoura district in northern aden, destroying at least one building and shattering windows in others. a plume of smoke rose over the area. ambulances raced to the scene to evacuate the wounded. pictures circulating on social media showed several young men in military uniform being carried away. residents said two suicide bombers carried out the attack. but islamic state, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said only one bomber was involved and identified him as abu hajar al adani. the group said adani targeted the operations room of the  apostate security belt , destroying it and killing and wounding all those inside it. pictures posted on social media showed young men in military uniforms being carried away in bandages. the security belt was set up by the united arab emirates, a key member of the saudi led coalition that has been fighting the iran aligned houthis since they advanced on aden in 2015, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee to saudi arabia. the civil war between the iran aligned houthis and the internationally recognized hadi government has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than two million. the war  drags on with no sign that it will end soon. tuesday s attack was the second of its kind in aden this month. on nov. 5, a car bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint, killing 15 people and wounding at least 20. islamic state also claimed responsibility for that assault but provided no evidence it was involved [nl5n1nb0ef].

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on wednesday there could be no normal relations with russia until moscow ended its support for separatists in ukraine and returned crimea, in comments likely to reassure western allies. speaking after a dinner where he discussed russia with nato foreign ministers on tuesday, tillerson took a tougher stance than u.s. president donald trump, who has sought better relations with russian president vladimir putin. trump said last month after meeting putin in vietnam that he believed putin s denial of accusations that moscow meddled in the 2016 u.s. election. that was despite u.s. intelligence agencies  evidence of russian interference.  at nato, tillerson criticized  russia s continued use of hybrid warfare  and its attempts  to undermine western institutions  in a reference to the mix of state sponsored computer hacks and internet disinformation campaigns that nato allies  intelligence agencies say is targeted at the west.  this stands as a significant obstacle to normalizing our relations,  tillerson told reporters. at the nato dinner with ministers, tillerson also blamed russia for interfering in the u.s. election, said a diplomat who was present. russia has denied meddling. trump, whose former aides are being investigated after accusations that putin influenced the election that brought him to the white house, has repeatedly emphasized that it would be better if russia and the united states could work together.      tillerson, a former exxon mobil chief executive, has spent much of his time as secretary of state trying to smooth the  america first  foreign policy that has alarmed trump s allies, but the president has publicly undercut the secretary of state s diplomatic initiatives. his trip to europe this week was partly overshadowed by reports the white house had a plan to replace him, which tillerson denied on wednesday. [l8n1o63lc]   tillerson stressed to ministers that the ukraine crisis, which was sparked by moscow s 2014 annexation of crimea, was the central issue that blocked better u.s. russia ties because seizing sovereign territory was unacceptable, according to a second diplomat present.  the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. russia denies accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters.  people are still dying every day from that violence,  tillerson said.  tillerson, who in 2013 as head of exxon mobil was awarded the order of friendship by putin, a russian state honor, said he hoped to agree to deploy u.n. troops to eastern ukraine, an idea the russian president floated in september. with an internationally agreed ceasefire long broken and efforts to revive a 2015 peace deal stalled, peacekeepers could end hostilities and allow trade to resume between russia and ukraine. but tillerson warned there was still a  significant difference between the mandate that a peacekeeping force would be given and the scope of their mandate .  we hope we can close those gaps,  tillerson said. russia is keen to see the end of western sanctions imposed over the ukraine crisis but european officials fear u.n. peacekeepers would freeze the conflict rather than solving it. tillerson also cautioned against treating russia as a partner, saying all meetings with moscow should be based on issues, not agreed on the basis of a calendar, quashing any hopes of a detente in moscow s relations with washington.   i think there is broad consensus among all the nato members that there is no normalization of dialogue with russia today,  he said.

" the american bar association issued a glowing evaluation of president barack obama’s u.s. supreme court nominee on tuesday, giving merrick garland its highest rating even as senate republicans stood firm in their blockade of his appointment. the influential lawyers association, which has evaluated the qualifications of nominees to the federal judiciary since 1953, deemed garland “well qualified,” the highest of its three ratings, for a lifetime job on america’s highest court. “the unanimous consensus of everyone we interviewed was  that judge garland is superbly competent to serve on the united  states supreme court,” the aba panel that conducted the evaluation said in a report. obama nominated garland, 63, on march 16 to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. garland is a centrist jurist with two decades as a federal appeals court judge. a nominee’s aba rating typically is considered when the senate acts on a judicial appointment. republicans were unswayed. in an emailed statement, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell’s office pointed out that obama and vice president joe biden, when they were senators, tried to block the 2006 supreme court confirmation of conservative samuel alito, even though he also earned the aba’s highest rating.  supreme court nominations require senate confirmation, and the republicans who control the chamber have denied garland customary hearings and a confirmation vote. senate republican leaders have vowed not to act on any supreme court nominee put forward by obama, arguing that the next president, to be elected on nov. 8 and take office on jan. 20, should fill scalia’s vacancy. obama has accused senate republicans of abdicating their constitutional duties. the court is now split 4 4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning scalia’s successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come. the white house renewed its demand that the senate act on garland. spokesman josh earnest said “it is such a shame he has been treated so unfairly by the united states senate” in an “unprecedented partisan action.” the republicans are hoping their presumptive nominee, donald trump, wins the presidency and nominates a conservative to the court. “this significant point warrants repeating,” the aba panel wrote. “all of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, several former solicitor generals from both political parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country,  and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in private practice, government or within the judiciary describe  the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view.” ",0
" democratic lawmakers in illinois on thursday said they have placed on hold a bill that expands state funded coverage of abortions for low income residents and state employees but faces a likely veto from the state’s republican governor.  the bill, which received final passage in a 33 22 state senate vote on wednesday, also aims to keep abortions legal in illinois if the u.s. supreme court follows president donald trump’s call to overturn its landmark roe v. wade ruling that made abortions legal 44 years ago.  democratic state senator don harmon filed a motion wednesday night to reconsider the senate’s vote, meaning the bill will not immediately be sent to governor bruce rauner.  “this measure is too important to immediately put it in the hands of a governor whose public opinions about women’s access to safe, affordable reproductive health care have been inconsistent at best,” harmon said in a statement on thursday. the senate can hold the bill for the duration of the legislative session, said harmon spokeswoman jayette bolinski.   illinois’ medicaid program covers abortions in cases of rape, incest and when a mother’s life or health is threatened. the expansion would enable poor women to obtain elective abortions. also, the legislation would allow state employees to have the procedures covered under state health insurance. a spokeswoman for rauner declined to comment on thursday. rauner, who faces re election next year, has promised to veto the legislation, saying illinois should focus on less “divisive” issues and instead pass a full year operating budget for the first time in nearly two years. a veto would be a sharp turn from his previous position, which political opponents are poised to exploit. as a candidate in 2014, he supported expanding abortion access.  illinois, the country’s fifth largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199 year history. rauner has feuded with democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence a state budget be tied to his list of policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits, freeze property taxes and impose new rules on injured workers seeking compensation from their employers.  with house speaker michael madigan and fellow democrats blocking that agenda, illinois has been without a complete budget during rauner’s first two years in office. the fiscal futility has left illinois   the only state ever to go 22 months without a budget   with around $12.2 billion in unpaid bills as of wednesday.

" advocates of landmark net neutrality rules on friday blasted federal communications commission chairman ajit pai’s plans to roll back the obama era legal framework. reuters and other outlets reported late thursday that pai told major telecommunications trade groups of his plans tuesday to replace 2015 net neutrality rules with voluntary agreements to adopt open internet principles. the 2015 rules prevented broadband providers from giving or selling speedy or so called fastlane access to some internet services over others.  pai, a republican appointed by president donald trump, opposes the rules approved by the fcc which gave the agency strong legal control over broadband providers, treating them much like utilities. fcc commissioner mignon clyburn, a democrat, said if the reports are accurate “we are gearing up for a battle that could eviscerate the widely supported open internet protections.” the rules “were built on a record of more than four million comments, and demonstrated that a free and open internet is at the very heart of our american democracy,” she added. chris lewis, vice president at public knowledge said pai could “give dominant cable and telecommunications companies what their dc lobbyists have dreamed of for years: voluntary net neutrality ‘rules’ where consumer protection is no more than ‘trust your cable or internet provider.’” the fcc declined to comment.  pai wants to introduce new regulations under which internet providers like at&t inc, comcast corp and verizon communications inc would voluntarily agree in their terms of service to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content. the move would allow the federal trade commission to enforce compliance with the new rules. internet providers do not oppose net neutrality principles, but opposed the decision to reclassify internet service under a law that subjects them to potential utility style regulation. pai is expected to unveil his proposal as early as april 27, with an initial vote planned for either may or june, sources told reuters. the proposal would be open for public comment before the fcc could finalize it. the internet association, the trade group that represents major internet companies like alphabet inc, facebook inc, netflix inc and microsoft crop, and strongly supports net neutrality, will meet with pai on tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said. the group declined to comment.

" president donald trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration, and he did it without building his wall. the victory was announced last week by the department of homeland security (dhs), which released figures showing a 93 percent drop since december of parents and children caught trying to cross the mexico border illegally.  in december, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in march, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100.  it was a remarkable decline   steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions   but for eight dhs officials interviewed by reuters it was not surprising.  trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants. but, internally, according to the dhs officials familiar with the department’s strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. this planning has not been previously reported.  in the months since trump’s inauguration, dhs has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border. the department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border. dhs secretary john kelly told a senate hearing on april 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to trump’s tough policies. to date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration. mothers and children aren’t being separated   and dhs has shelved the plan; parents haven’t been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. yet the number of migrants trying to cross – especially women and children – has dropped drastically.  asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, dhs spokesman jonathan hoffman referenced the march drop, saying, “those were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.”   the white house declined to comment and referred reuters to dhs. for months, central americans had heard about trump’s get tough policies. and public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. some of the ads were funded by the united states, others by united nations agencies and regional governments. one radio ad in honduras featured a mother, saying, “it’s been a year and i don’t know if she is alive or dead. i’d do anything to have her here with me. curse the day i sent her north.” the possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, honduran deputy foreign minister maria andrea matamoros told reuters “that worries any mother that wants to go to the united states with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans,” she said.  the policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of capitol hill staffers and others called together by trump’s transition team in the weeks after the nov. 8 election. the group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the dhs officials and a congressional aide.  one goal was to help trump fulfill a major campaign promise: ending so called “catch and release,” the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the united states while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved.   the group quickly identified a major obstacle   the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the dhs officials and the aide.  because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the united states while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases. the incoming trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. but the new administration was bound by the same court ruling. after kelly’s confirmation as homeland security chief in late january, several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at dhs. gene hamilton, who had worked for then republican senator jeff sessions, became senior counselor to kelly, and dimple shah, who had been staff director of the house national security subcommittee, became deputy general counsel.  kathy nuebel kovarik, formerly a staffer for republican senator chuck grassley, became policy chief at u.s. citizenship and immigration services. julie kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative federation for american immigration reform to become a top policy adviser at u.s. customs and border protection. none of the group’s members agreed to be interviewed by reuters. several dhs officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants. soon, they had the bare bones of a plan: since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention, why not separate them from their mothers, sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers, the two dhs officials and congressional aide said. the group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children: raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers. the thinking was that “if they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks   or even threaten to do that   they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet,” said one dhs official familiar with the planning. on jan. 25, five days after taking office, trump issued an executive order ending “catch and release.” (a u.s. immigration and customs enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order.)  a week later, in a town hall with u.s. customs and immigration services officers, chief asylum officer john lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi public setting for the first time, according to notes of the meeting seen by reuters. for more than a month after that meeting, the proposal did not leak, but after reuters broke news of it in early march, kelly confirmed that it was under consideration. democratic members of congress blasted the proposal, and within days it had made headlines across mexico and central america.  that month, the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one third of what it had been in february.  when kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping, they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children – at least for now. asked whether it may be revived, dhs spokeswoman jenny burke said, “families caught crossing the border illegally, generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it.” ",0
" u.s. senate democratic leader harry reid said on tuesday that amendments were necessary to a puerto rico debt bill that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said would be voted on by next week. reid, speaking to reporters, said changes were needed to the federal board overseeing the restructuring of puerto rico’s $70 billion debt under the bill, but he did not say whether democrats would be successful in making any changes. the house of representatives passed a puerto rico debt relief bill on june 9, following months of internal debate. supporters hope the senate passes that bill, without any amendment, before july 1, when puerto rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment. the caribbean island, which is a u.s. territory, is suffering a poverty rate of about 45 percent and has been hobbled by worsening debt problems. some schools and medical facilities are closing and thousands of residents are relocating to the u.s. mainland, further shrinking puerto rico’s tax base. while reid said he had “some serious concerns” with the current bill, which was negotiated by the obama administration and lawmakers in the house, he did not say whether he expected any amendments to succeed in the senate. a senate debate over amendments could simply help put democrats on record registering their concerns with the legislation. “at the very minimum, we need some amendments to make sure that people understand what is not in that bill,” reid said. democrats in both chambers have voiced concerns over some potential minimum wage reductions for young workers that republicans included in the house bill. they also have said the federal oversight board, to be appointed by washington, might not have puerto rico’s best interests in mind. supporters of the bill have argued it is the best measure that can pass the republican controlled congress and that  puerto rico could slip into chaos without action.

" president vladimir putin may be criticized by the west for the annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014, but at home his public approval ratings have been boosted. the operation to seize the peninsula, hailed by russian nationalists as  the crimean spring , led to an upsurge in what is called  military and patriotic education  of russian youths. in the southern region of stavropol, interest has been revived in the cossacks, a warrior class in tsarist times, and in the history of tsarist and modern wars which moscow fought in the north caucasus region. the cossacks, who were portrayed as peaceful ploughmen in quiet times, were swift to repel attacks from nearby regions, such as chechnya and dagestan, or join moscow s military campaigns elsewhere.  tomorrow begins today,  reads the motto of a cadet school in stavropol that was named after alexei yermolov, a 19th century russian general who conquered the caucasus for the russian empire. a reuters photo essay (reut.rs/2jp4dgu) captures images from the general yermolov cadet school training in stavropol and in the countryside. most cadets come from families of active russian soldiers or officers from other security forces. about 40 percent of school leavers join the military or law enforcement agencies. many instructors spent years in  hot spots  or conflict zones. a group of teenagers from the  patriot  club in crimea visited the school s field camp, named  russian knights , over the summer. up to 600 boys and girls train there each summer. this camp trains more than 1,500 teenagers a year. physical exercises go hand in hand with weapons training, marksmanship tests, car driving and even parachuting.

" republicans in wisconsin tilted district maps in their favor in order to hamper democrats and ultimately win state elections in 2012 and 2014, a federal court said on monday in a case that could influence future rulings on gerrymandering. the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin decided 2 1 that act 43, a redrawing of districts approved by the state’s republican led legislature in 2012, violated the u.s. constitution, court documents showed.  “we find that the discriminatory effect is not explained by the political geography of wisconsin nor is it justified by a legitimate state interest,” the court wrote in its ruling. the case has no bearing on donald trump’s victory in wisconsin in the presidential election on nov. 8, in which he defeated democrat hillary clinton. wisconsin attorney general brad schimel said in a statement that he planned to appeal, which would send the case to the u.s. supreme court. a ruling there on gerrymandering   the practice of manipulating electoral boundaries for political advantage   could have wide implications across the country as similar cases in maryland and north carolina work their way through lower courts.     “this is a big victory for those who want to see courts rein in partisan gerrymandering. but it is anybody’s guess what happens to this when it gets to the supreme court,” wrote richard hasen, an elections law expert at the university of california, irvine, on his blog. since 2010, republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures. they now control both legislative chambers in a record 32 states, the new york times reported. “republicans win elections because we have better candidates and a better message that continues to resonate with the voters,” said republican assembly speaker robin vos in a statement. twelve wisconsin voters argued in their lawsuit that republicans redrew maps in 2011 to divide democratic voters so they fall short of a majority in districts and to concentrate democratic voters into districts so they win by overwhelming margins and dilute votes of democrats statewide, according to the ruling.   despite receiving 51 percent of the votes statewide in 2012, democrats won only 39 of 99 assembly seats. in 2014, republicans won roughly the same percentage of votes statewide, but won 63 seats, a 24 seat disparity, judges wrote.  the wisconsin case hinged on a new way to measure the discriminatory effect of gerrymandering. the “efficiency gap” measure found the redistricting in wisconsin caused democrats to waste more votes than republicans.     the measure gives judges “a clear threshold for deciding what is acceptable”, barry burden, the director of the elections research center at the university of wisconsin madison, told the new york times.

" eleven people were injured on saturday when a car collided with pedestrians near london s natural history museum, in one of the capital s busiest tourist areas, but police doused concerns it was a terrorist attack, saying it was a road traffic incident.  police said it was believed the car had mounted the pavement outside the popular attraction in west london and collided with a number of pedestrians.  officers had arrested a man aged in his 40s at the scene and he was now being questioned on suspicion of dangerous driving after being taken to hospital for treatment. britain has suffered five attacks blamed on terrorism so far this year, three of which involved vehicles, and the incident in an area packed with tourists at the weekend had prompted concerns that the collision had been a deliberate act.  the incident is entirely a road traffic investigation and is not a terrorist related incident,  a police statement said.  london s ambulance service said they had treated 11 people, mostly for head and leg injuries, with nine taken to hospital. police said none of the injuries were life threatening or life changing and the majority of those hospitalized had now been discharged. unverified footage from the scene showed a man being pinned to the ground near a crashed black toyota car. oliver cheshire, a model who is the fianc  of british pop singer pixie lott, told the daily mail newspaper he was one of those who had helped detain the man. he said three female passengers in the car told him it was a private hire taxi.  he was driving down the pavement and hit 11 to 12 people. then the guy was screaming,  he told the paper.  he looked at me and i was really in shock. i got out of my car and grabbed him   three of us grabbed him   and someone phoned the police.  cheshire later wrote on twitter:  thanks for messaging everybody. i m ok. thank you to the men who helped me pin him down and the police for coming so quickly.  neither police nor transport for london, which runs most of the city s transport system, would comment on the status of the vehicle.  my thanks to the first responders at this incident this afternoon and the actions of members of the public. my thoughts are with the injured,  prime minister theresa may said on twitter. britain is on its second highest security alert level, meaning an attack by militants is considered highly likely.  in march, a man drove a car into pedestrians on london s westminster bridge killing four before stabbing a police officer to death in the grounds of parliament. three islamist militants drove into people on london bridge in june before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. the same month, a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque in north london which left one man dead.

" the u.s. presidential race is tied going into the major parties’ national conventions and democrat hillary clinton has been damaged by the fbi investigation into her email use while secretary of state, a new opinion poll showed on thursday. the new york times/cbs news poll showed 67 percent of voters surveyed said clinton was not honest and trustworthy, up 5 percentage points from a cbs poll conducted last month before the fbi made its findings public. as donald trump prepares to accept the republican presidential nomination next week, the poll showed him in a dead heat with clinton in a general election matchup. each candidate drew 40 percent of the vote, compared with the 6 percentage point lead enjoyed by clinton in last month’s survey, the poll showed. the margin of error was 3 percentage points in the cbs news/new york times poll, which was conducted by telephone july 8 12 among a random sample of 1,600 adults nationwide, including 1,358 registered voters.   the survey showed 62 percent of voters surveyed distrust trump as well. “but mrs. clinton’s shifting and inaccurate explanations of her email practices at the state department appear to have resonated more deeply with the electorate,” the times wrote. fbi director james comey said last week clinton was “extremely careless” in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws. the times/cbs poll echoes the finding of a quinnipiac poll released on wednesday that showed trump pulling just ahead of clinton in the so called swing states of florida and pennsylvania as the former u.s. senator and first lady lost ground on honesty and moral standards. in contrast to the new york times/cbs news poll, a reuters/ipsos online opinion poll released on tuesday showed clinton leading trump by 13 points at a national level, with 46 percent to trump’s 33 percent support among likely voters. the election is on nov. 8.

" the vatican needs to bring cases of suspected money laundering to trial, a european finance watchdog urged on friday, saying the good progress made by its financial regulators needed to be matched by judicial muscle. moneyval, the monitoring body of the council of europe, said the vatican s prosecutor also should be more  proactive  in other financial crimes, such as corruption, embezzlement or abuse of office, and  actively consider appealing sentences which he considers unduly lenient .  on the law enforcement side, after five years of development of (anti money laundering legislation) it is somewhat surprising that no prosecution or indictment has so far been brought before the (vatican) tribunal which involves a count of money laundering,  the report said. it said the success rate of the prosecutor before the tribunal  is so far not encouraging . in a statement, the vatican acknowledged  there are still areas for further improvement, in particular as regards law enforcement and the judicial side . pope francis has made cleaning up vatican finances a priority since his election in 2013, and holy see staff worked with the moneyval evaluators. but his efforts appear to have hit obstacles in recent months. the vatican s finance minister, cardinal george pell, has taken an indefinite leave of absence to face accusations of  historical sexual offences  in his native australia. he denies them. in june, the vatican s first auditor general resigned, and last week, the vatican bank s deputy director general was fired under circumstances that the vatican has not made clear. the 200 page report generally praised the work of the vatican s financial intelligence authority, known by its italian acronym aif and headed by swiss lawyer rene bruelhart. it said the number and quality of suspicious activity reports sent to the aif by vatican departments or individuals had increased significantly, meaning the bureaucratic reporting procedures  have steadily improved . the aif passes on reports it deems worthy of further investigation to the prosecutor s office. but the report lamented the lack of prosecution in cases of suspected money laundering. in 2015, for example, an investigation was opened after an internal report said a department of the holy see that oversees real estate and investments was used in the past for possible money laundering by italian bankers, insider trading and market manipulation. the case still has not gone to trial. in april, italy put the vatican on its  white list  of states with cooperative financial institutions, ending years of mistrust. hundreds of suspicious or dormant accounts at the vatican bank, which was the officially known as the institute for works of religion (ior) have been closed in recent years. the moneyval report said the aif s supervision of the ior  is now firmly established .

" the trump administration has reversed an obama administration stance and will support ohio in its bid at the u.s. supreme court to revive a state policy of purging people from voter registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots. the justice department filed legal papers with the high court on monday staking out the new position in the voting rights case, backing the republican led state’s policy to purge inactive voters. former president barack obama’s justice department had argued in a lower court that ohio’s policy violated the 1993 national voter registration act, which congress passed to make it easier for americans to register to vote.  civil liberties advocates who challenged ohio’s policy have said it illegally erased thousands of voters from registration rolls and can disproportionately impact minorities and poor people who tend to back democratic candidates. the state on tuesday welcomed the administration’s action but voting rights advocates opposed it. the league of women voters accused the administration of “playing politics with our democracy and threatening the fundamental right to vote” by siding with an ohio policy it said disenfranchises eligible voters. “our democracy is stronger when more people have access to the ballot box   not fewer,” the democratic national committee added.  the 6th u.s. circuit court of appeals in cincinnati last year blocked ohio’s policy, ruling that it ran afoul of the 1993 law. the state appealed to the supreme court, which agreed in may to hear the case.  the legal brief filed by the justice department said president donald trump’s administration had reconsidered the government’s stance and now supports ohio. the brief, signed by acting u.s. solicitor general jeffrey wall, argued that ohio’s policy is sound because it does not immediately remove voters from the rolls for failing to vote, but only triggers an address verification procedure.  the american civil liberties union last year sued ohio republican secretary of state jon husted over the policy. the suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015. husted said in a statement he welcomed the federal government’s support, noting ohio’s policy “has been in place for more than two decades and administered the same way by both republican and democrat secretaries of state.” under ohio’s policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. if they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. ohio officials argue that canceling inactive voters helps keep voting rolls current, clearing out those who have moved away or died. democrats have accused republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of groups who generally favor democratic candidates.

" u.s. president donald trump’s choice to lead the labor department admitted to employing an undocumented immigrant as a house cleaner, the kind of revelation that derailed cabinet nominees in previous administrations. andrew puzder, chief executive officer of cke restaurants inc, is one of several trump nominees who face strong opposition from senate democrats and progressive groups. in a statement late on monday, puzder said he and his wife had employed a housekeeper for a few years without being aware that she was not legally permitted to work in the united states. “when i learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status,” he said in the statement. he said he paid back taxes for employing the maid to the u.s. internal revenue service and to california.  the statement was first reported by the huffington post. senator lamar alexander, chairman of the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, the panel that will vet puzder’s nomination, said in a statement that puzder had reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it. “i do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a cabinet secretary,” he added. the disclosure came as senate democrats held an all night session in a final attempt to block the nomination of betsy devos, the billionaire school choice champion whom trump nominated to be education secretary.  puzder’s tentative date for a confirmation hearing has been repeatedly postponed, as the committee awaited completion of an ethics review by the office of government ethics. as of tuesday, the committee had still not received any of the necessary paperwork on puzder’s nomination, though the federal bureau of investigation background check had been completed, according to a committee aide. senator patty murray, the ranking democrat on the panel, said on tuesday she was troubled by the delay and by stories from workers for cke’s primarily franchised fast food restaurants who have come forward in recent weeks to complain about wage theft and other labor conditions. “if mr. puzder ever does come before our committee, he’s going to have a lot of explaining to do,” she said. puzder’s nomination has sparked protests around the country by some cke fast food workers and the union backed “fight for $15” movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. puzder has criticized an overtime rule championed by the obama administration and opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. additionally, some of cke’s racy advertisements featuring women in bikinis have caused democrats to ask questions about how puzder will address sexual harassment in the workplace. it is unclear whether the issues with hiring an undocumented worker could impede puzder’s confirmation. wilbur ross, trump’s pick for commerce secretary, admitted last month that he recently fired a household employee who could not provide proof of legal status.  a senate panel later approved his nomination. he was awaiting confirmation by the full senate. however, previous presidential appointees have run into problems over immigrant labor   including two former nominees under republican president george w. bush and a previous nominee under democratic president bill clinton.  all three of those nominees withdrew their names for consideration after the news came to light.

" the u.s. senate on tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the house of representatives. by a vote of 68 29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely senate approval this week. two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the senate. meanwhile, the white house threatened to veto a $622.1 million zika bill poised to pass the house of representatives later this week, saying it was “woefully inadequate.” unlike the senate legislation, the house bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. many conservative republicans in the house refuse to approve zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while democrats and some senate republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. republican senator roy blunt from missouri told reporters that the senate measure “trimmed this package back (from obama’s request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time.” democratic senator patty murray from washington, who crafted the legislation with blunt, added, “we are going to need to keep the pressure on house republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need.” it was unclear how long it might take the senate and house to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. u.s. health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. the world health organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that zika can also cause guillain barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. last year, brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern u.s. states including florida. house republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the obama administration already shifted to zika from unused funds to battle ebola, would provide enough money through sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. the administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine.

" u.s. states have negotiated to the bitter end to keep health insurers selling obamacare plans in every county next year, in some cases taking a hard line to prevent exits that leave residents without access to health coverage. but states cannot rule out a last minute pullout by an insurance company.     insurers must sign government contracts detailing where they will offer 2018 coverage by midnight on wednesday. in recent months, dozens of u.s. counties risked having no insurer offering subsidized individual insurance next year after national players including anthem inc, aetna inc and humana inc announced plans to pull out. (tmsnrt.rs/2k1halv) many insurers have lost money on their obamacare business. others fear exposure to a program targeted by president donald trump and the republican controlled congress for repeal. trump has also threatened to cut billions in subsidy payments to insurers to undermine predecessor barack obama’s healthcare law. still, insurance commissioners in republican leaning states such as tennessee, missouri, and virginia spent months negotiating with insurers to see who might pull out of their markets and either convince them to stay, or find a replacement. by tuesday, it appeared they had succeeded in keeping every county covered in all states. but individuals will still face challenges. nearly half of u.s. counties have no choice, with only one insurer offering individual plans. and many insurers filed price hikes of 20 percent or more to offset the political uncertainty. some states still fear a last minute surprise. “my colleagues and i are still very concerned that today insurers are making a decision about whether or not to participate,” tennessee insurance commissioner julie mcpeak said. “that makes us nervous.” after humana said it would exit the obamacare business entirely, leaving the knoxville area with no insurer, blue cross blue shield of tennessee said it would step into the region. georgia regulators warned anthem that it could not sell in the state for five years if it left any bare counties, deputy insurance commissioner jay florence said. as a result, after first proposing to stay in just one county next year, anthem only left markets in georgia where it could be sure at least one other insurer is offering coverage. in virginia, anthem planned an exit that would have left more than 60 counties without any individual insurance options, but changed course two weeks ago after discussions with the state. “bare counties is a highly political issue and health plans have been concerned about the consequences of being called out publicly,” said caroline pearson, senior vice president at healthcare consultancy avalere health. scant competition, high prices    the push could not preserve competition in many states. in 2018, nearly half of u.s. counties will have only one insurer offering individual plans, according to federal data. in 2017, a third of counties had only one insurer. in 2016, only 7 percent of counties had only a single choice. but it did convince some to alter plans. molina healthcare said in july it would exit two states and was considering further departures.  in the end, it is remaining in seven states where it sells individual plans   include california, florida, michigan, new mexico, ohio, texas and washington   a spokeswoman said tuesday. cigna corp, which had planned to sell obamacare coverage in six states for 2018, said it will make final details public after the deadline. anthem and healthcare services corp, which runs blue cross blue shield in illinois, texas and other states, did not comment further on their plans. such insurers will wade into 2018 obamacare markets with no certainty over the program’s fate. senate republicans on tuesday failed again to muster enough votes to repeal and replace the 2010 affordable care act, but vowed to revive the effort in the coming months after tackling tax reform. state health commissioners allowed them to propose monthly premium increases of 20 percent, or even more, from 2017 to compensate for the uncertainty. “we didn’t really have much choice,” mcpeak of tennessee said. “we were fearful that insurers, if they filed lower rates, would decide not to come into the market.” ",0
" the successful conclusion of the trans pacific partnership trade talks remains the top legislative item for the united states, a top economic adviser to president barack obama said on tuesday. white house national security council adviser christina segal knowles told a news conference ahead of the sept. 4 5 g20 summit in china that talks on a trade pact with europe were still in progress, despite comments from france and germany that they were in doubt. the asian talks are stalled in congress and both democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump have said they would not approve the deal in its current form, if elected president in november. segal knowles said corporate tax issues would be on the g20’s agenda in china, although when asked whether the european union’s tax ruling on apple inc’s deal with ireland would be discussed, she did not directly address the issue facing the company.

" mitch mcconnell, the top republican in the u.s. senate, says he could live without the drama surrounding president donald trump’s white house, but from a policy standpoint sees the new commander in chief as a solid ally in the mode of any president from his party. mcconnell told reuters that he finds trump accessible and that they talk regularly, even more frequently than he spoke to the last republican president, george w. bush. while mcconnell would not discuss the substance of their conversations, he said the two are able to be frank with one another without it damaging their relationship. “we have a good relationship. he’s never, as far as i can tell, gotten angry at me   in my presence, anyway. we have a good working relationship,” mcconnell said during a roundtable with reuters reporters on wednesday. mcconnell, who last week said he hoped to see “less drama” from the white house, said that trump does not always take his advice. “he knows, as you all know, that i’ve not been a fan of the tweets and the extracurricular comments. i said last week we could do with a little less drama,” mcconnell said. cracking a grin, he added, “the reason i’m smiling   obviously, he’s disinclined to take my advice on some things. but it has not impaired the ability to communicate and convey my opinion, which i do frequently.” in matters of style, mcconnell and trump are a study in contrasts. the senate majority leader is a taciturn traditionalist steeped in the ways of washington, after more than three decades in congress. trump, a real estate magnate and reality tv celebrity who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency in january, airs his views regularly on twitter and has vowed to drain what he calls the “swamp” of the u.s. capital. mcconnell declined to say if he had advised trump to speak less about the controversy dogging the administration: questions about whether associates of trump colluded with alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign, and concerns about trump’s abrupt dismissal of fbi director james comey as the agency was probing the russia matter. on questions concerning russia, mcconnell stuck to his script. “i think all of that is going to be handled by the special counsel and the senate intelligence committee, and i’m confident in their ability to do the job,” he said, referring to a special counsel appointed by the justice department last week, and to one of several congressional panels probing the russia issue. some republican lawmakers and lobbyists worry the issue will slow legislative plans. republicans have yet to chalk up significant legislative achievements despite being in control of the white house and both chambers of congress. but mcconnell said he and trump are aligned in putting an overhaul of obamacare and a rewrite of the tax code at the top of their agenda. mcconnell acknowledged there had been doubts within his party during the 2016 campaign about what trump would do in the white house. “this was a guy who was giving fund raisers for (senate democratic leader) chuck schumer four or five years ago,” mcconnell said. but mcconnell, whose wife elaine chao is a member of trump’s cabinet as transportation secretary, said he sees trump as someone who has embraced republican orthodoxy. “in other words, what the administration is doing, not only am i comfortable with it, but i think the vast majority of republicans in congress feel that this is a right of center presidency, which is what we had hoped” for, he said. “if you look at what the president is actually for, it strikes me as indistinguishable from what a president jeb bush or a president marco rubio would have been advocating: deregulation, tax reform, repeal and replace of obamacare, judges like neil gorsuch,” mcconnell said. trump’s relationship with congress has been boosted by the frequent and “very significant” presence of vice president mike pence in the halls of capitol hill, mcconnell said, describing pence’s role as “serious value added.” “he is, in my view, kind of the de facto congressional relations guy for the administration,” he said, noting pence, a former indiana governor and republican congressman, has strong relationships on the hill. mcconnell described pence as playing a similar role with congress as vice president dick cheney did during the george w. bush administration: listening and sometimes weighing in on discussions about healthcare and tax reform. “it’s been really helpful because members feel like they can go over and whisper in his ear about whatever their particular problem is, and something will be done about it, because they’ve kind of elevated it to a higher level,” mcconnell said.

" singapore has banned two muslim foreign preachers from entering the city state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony, the government said on monday. the decision to block ismail menk, identified by local media as a zimbabwean and haslin bin baharim as a malaysian, is the latest move by the singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views. menk has preached muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals, singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement.  it accused baharim of holding views that promote discord between muslims and non muslims, whom he described as  deviant.   (their views) are unacceptable in the context of singapore s multi racial and multi religious society,  the ministry said.  reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair. singapore is predominantly chinese, many of whom follow buddhism and taoism but 14 percent of the population is muslim and nearly 19 percent christian.   authorities in the city state, an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon, are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony. over the past few years, singapore increased its level of surveillance for islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of islamic state in the region. menk and baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from singapore next month after their applications for short term work passes to preach in singapore were turned down, the government said.     they will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from singapore,  the home ministry said. last month, authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign christian preachers to speak in singapore as they had made  denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions.

" nigeria s vice president yemi osinbajo, who has served as acting president for much of this year, said on monday he had not given any thought to contesting the country s next presidential election in 2019. nigeria has faced heightened uncertainty over whether president muhammadu buhari plans to contest the next election. buhari, 74, took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness.  osinbajo, a 60 year old law professor, served as acting president during buhari s absences, succeeding in calming tensions in the oil producing delta region and pushing small steps to improve the business climate, including foreign currency reforms. some business leaders say he could provide stability by running for president himself in feb 2019. asked at the ft africa summit in london if he had considered running, osinbajo said he hadn t thought about it, adding:  none of that is on the cards . osinbajo also said that militants in the oil producing niger delta region no longer posed a significant threat to oil production.  he said nigeria had lost as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil production last year amid militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure, which is concentrated in the southern delta region. it was now pumping roughly 1.85 million bpd and climbing toward 2 million bpd. that is closer to its top production of around 2.2 million bpd.   still, he added that nigeria needed to diversify its oil dependent economy and take advantage of the resource while it was still in high demand.   we don t have all the time in the world with oil,  he said.  we have to use oil while it makes sense to do so.

" three united nations soldiers from bangladesh were killed by an explosive device that detonated as they were escorting a convoy in northern mali on sunday, the west african country s peacekeeping mission and bangladesh s military said.  attacks on peacekeepers in mali, where islamist groups continue to operate in the vast desert in the north of the country, have made the u.n. mission there, minusma, the organization s deadliest. another five u.n. troops were seriously wounded in sunday s explosion, which occurred at around 7 a.m. (0700 gmt) on the main road between the towns of anefis and gao, minusma said in a statement.  our thoughts go firstly to the families and loved ones. we pledge our complete support to them during this painful ordeal,  the head of minusma, koen davidse, said.  the mission will use all means to ensure that justice is rendered.   the u.n. did not immediately release the nationalities of the soldiers. but the bangladesh military s media department confirmed that three of its soldiers had died by an improvised explosive device during an encounter with militants, adding that four other bangladeshi peacekeepers were injured in the attack. west africa s arid sahel region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups   some linked to al qaeda and islamic state   that european countries, particularly france, fear could threaten europe if left unchecked. despite a 2013 french led military operation that drove back militants who had seized control of mali s north, the area remains home to groups that have staged assaults on high profile targets in the capital bamako, burkina faso and ivory coast. minusma, established in the wake of the french intervention, has struggled to quell the unrest. the u.n. security council established a sanctions regime this month that allows the body to blacklist anyone who violates or obstructs a fragile 2015 peace deal signed by mali s government and separatist groups. anyone who attacks peacekeepers, hinders the delivery of aid, commits human rights abuses or recruits child soldiers could also face sanctions, including a global travel ban or asset freeze.

" u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he thinks susan rice, a former top adviser to president barack obama, committed a crime by seeking the identities of trump associates mentioned in intercepted communications, but he declined requests for evidence, the new york times reported. in an interview, trump declined to tell the new york times whether he had reviewed intelligence to bolster his claim about rice but said he would explain himself “at the right time.” rice said she had no immediate comment on the president’s remarks when contacted by reuters. later on wednesday, erin pelton, a spokesman for rice, said in an email to reuters: “i’m not going to dignify the president’s ludicrous charge with a comment.” trump and his allies have focused on unsubstantiated reports that rice, who served as obama’s national security adviser, disclosed the names of trump aides swept up in u.s. surveillance of foreign targets. rice dismissed the reports as “absolutely false” in an interview with msnbc on tuesday. according to five u.s. intelligence officials, rice followed standard procedure in requesting the national security agency to reveal to her the names of american citizens who had been in contact with russians whose communications were monitored by u.s. intelligence. it is unlikely she would have known that any unidentified american had a connection to trump, the officials said. as white house national security adviser, rice could not order the nsa to reveal the identities of any americans. instead, she could only request it to do so. such requests, which a number of senior officials are authorized to make, trigger a legal and intelligence review by the agency to determine whether revealing the name has potential intelligence value and could expose a security threat to the united states, said one of the officials, who is familiar with the process and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal intelligence procedures. there is nothing unusual, much less suspicious, about any request by rice, said another intelligence official, especially since it could have revealed russian intelligence contacts or agents operating in the united states. this official and two other intelligence officials said the nsa often receives dozens of such requests in a month. john culhane, a professor at widener university delaware law school, said he thought rice could have a credible libel lawsuit against trump. though public figures like rice face a higher standard in bringing such claims, culhane said she could contend trump demonstrated a “reckless disregard” for the truth. but the president typically enjoys immunity from civil lawsuits over official acts, culhane noted, and a court could find that trump’s interview with the newspaper was within the scope of his official duties.

" u.s. vice president joe biden said on friday he doubted whether donald trump could undo much of the current administration’s record on the environment because so many green policies have firmly taken hold. trump, who will take over as president on jan. 20, has said he does not believe in global warming and will name a climate change skeptic, oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, to head the environmental protection agency. the republican is expected to nominate another climate change skeptic, u.s. representative cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington state, to head the interior department, sources briefed on the matter told reuters on friday. democratic president barack obama has made the fight against global warming a priority, and biden said businesses now realized his policies made sense economically. “there is a constituency that crosses party lines. regardless of whether the next administration is as aggressive as we have been   and i’m not suggesting they intend to    there is no way to turn back this tide that has begun to roll,” the vice president told a canadian environmental summit. the obama administration has lifted vehicle fuel standards, invested heavily in renewable energy, pushed to curb methane gas emissions and adopted a clean power plan that requires states to cut carbon output. biden said that in some parts of the united states it was now cheaper to use solar or wind power rather than rely on power stations fueled by coal or gas. company executives were starting to price in carbon emissions reduction while motorists enjoyed not having to refuel their vehicles as often, he said. “reality has a way of intruding,” he said. “whatever uncertainly exists around the near term policy choices of the next president, i am absolutely confident the united states will continue making progress on this path to a low carbon future.”  “and that’s because many of the trends i’ve mentioned have taken hold and are no longer dependent on government initiatives. they are market driven, they are common sense.” trump has vowed that within his first 100 days in office he will rescind the clean power plan, eliminate “unwarranted restrictions” on hydraulic fracturing oil drilling technology, cut “outdated” regulations, and pull the country out of a global pact to curb warming of the planet. biden said, “one of the things the president and i are proudest of accomplishing over the last eight years is debunking the myth that america can’t grow our economy and bring down emissions at the same time.”. among those in the audience for biden’s remarks was canadian prime minister justin trudeau, who is also taking an aggressive stance on climate change.

" two north korean shipments to a syrian government agency responsible for the country s chemical weapons program were intercepted in the past six months, according to a confidential united nations report on north korea sanctions violations. the report by a panel of independent u.n. experts, which was submitted to the u.n. security council earlier this month and seen by reuters on monday, gave no details on when or where the interdictions occurred or what the shipments contained.   the panel is investigating reported prohibited chemical, ballistic missile and conventional arms cooperation between syria and the dprk (north korea),  the experts wrote in the 37 page report.   two member states interdicted shipments destined for syria. another member state informed the panel that it had reasons to believe that the goods were part of a komid contract with syria,  according to the report. komid is the korea mining development trading corporation. it was blacklisted by the security council in 2009 and described as pyongyang s key arms dealer and exporter of equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. in march 2016 the council also blacklisted two komid representatives in syria.   the consignees were syrian entities designated by the european union and the united states as front companies for syria s scientific studies and research centre (ssrc), a syrian entity identified by the panel as cooperating with komid in previous prohibited item transfers,  the u.n. experts wrote.  ssrc has overseen the country s chemical weapons program since the 1970s. the u.n. experts said activities between syria and north korea they were investigating included cooperation on syrian scud missile programs and maintenance and repair of syrian surface to air missiles air defense systems. the north korean and syrian missions to the united nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  the experts said they were also investigating the use of the vx nerve agent in malaysia to kill the estranged half brother of north korea s leader kim jong un in february.  north korea has been under u.n. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the security council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and four long range missile launches. syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by russia and the united states. however, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. during the country s more than six year long civil war the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons has said the banned nerve agent sarin has been used at least twice, while the use of chlorine as a weapon has been widespread. the syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

" britain must choose from a range of existing off the peg models for its relationship to the european union when it leaves the bloc, brussels  chief negotiator michel barnier has told a group of newspapers. barnier, who is leading the eu s negotiations with britain after last year s brexit vote, told handelsblatt that while it was in both sides  interest to maintain a close relationship, the range of possible relationships was limited.  the only way to do it without difficulties is by staying within the internal market. that would be the norway model, but the british government rejects it,  he said.  another option would be a free trade agreement like the ceta deal with canada.  even a canada style deal would take several years to negotiate. asked if there would be a specific british model after the country left on march 30, 2019, barnier said:  no.  european leaders decided this weekend that britain had not made enough progress on exit negotiations to begin work on devising a future relationship, leading to concern in europe and the world that britain could crash out of the bloc in disorderly fashion, with serious economic and political consequences.  a disorderly exit would bring enormous problems   mainly for britain, but also for us,  he said in the interview with handelsblatt and four further european newspapers. that would affect everything from food supply to healthcare. he added:  britain would leave the single air traffic space, losing take off and landing rights. it would no longer be a member of the euratom treaty and could no longer import nuclear material from the eu for hospitals and power stations.  the process of designing a longer term relationship with the eu was also fraught with difficulties, he added, warning that the eu would need to find ways to head off any british attempts to undercut european environmental or welfare standards.  we will have to arrange future co operation on defense and security policy in a separate treaty,  he said.  we will have to ward off british attempts to influence our decision making processes in this area.

" u.s. senator elizabeth warren on thursday urged the justice department’s top antitrust official to recuse himself from an ongoing review of at&t inc’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of time warner inc. she urged assistant attorney general for antitrust makan delrahim, who was confirmed late last month, not to take part in the review because of his previous statement that the merger did not pose a “major antitrust problem.”  “your refusal to recuse yourself will undermine public confidence in the division’s ability to reach an unbiased final decision in the matter,” warren wrote in the letter. warren’s concern over the deal is based on the fact that at&t already owns directv, which means that the proposed transaction would combine the biggest pay tv provider with a major u.s. content provider. time warner’s stable of content includes the premium cable channel hbo, tnt and news channel cnn, among others. at&t said last month it plans to reinvest more advertising revenue into content as it goes head to head with online streaming services such as netflix inc. at&t declined to comment and has said it hopes to complete the transaction by the end of the year. the justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" moscow based antivirus software maker kaspersky lab said on wednesday that its security software had taken source code for a secret american hacking tool from a personal computer in the united states.  in september, u.s. officials ordered kaspersky’s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.  after that announcement, the wall street journal reported on oct. 5 that hackers working for the russian government appeared to have targeted a national security agency (nsa) worker by using kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. the new york times reported on oct. 10 that israeli officials reported the operation to the united states after they hacked into kaspersky's network.  the russian government has denied any involvement.  kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. on wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a u.s. computer.  while reviewing the file’s contents, a kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what kaspersky calls the equation group. the software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to chief executive eugene kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.  kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the nsa’s loss of files described in media reports.  “we deleted the archive because we don’t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,” said kaspersky spokeswoman sarah kitsos.  source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the kaspersky customer.  former employees told reuters in july that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. kaspersky spokeswoman yuliya shlychkova on wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen “extremely rarely.”  kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the russian government.  kaspersky denied the journal’s report that its programs searched for keywords including “top secret.”  the company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by russian spies or anyone except the israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the american’s computer through a back door it later spotted there.  the nsa declined to comment on kaspersky’s review.  the new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the equation group in february 2015. at that time, reuters cited former nsa employees who said that equation group was an nsa project.  kaspersky’s equation group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. that gave the nsa almost undetectable presence.  shlychkova said the american machine’s files were found before the big equation group announcement but after kaspersky had discovered equation software on a machine in the middle east. she said that occurred in march 2014.  democratic senator jeanne shaheen, who led calls in the u.s. congress to purge kaspersky products from federal government networks, on wednesday sent a letter to dhs acting secretary elaine duke and director of national intelligence dan coats, urging the u.s. government to declassify information about kaspersky products.  the step was necessary, shaheen wrote, “to allow the american people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.”  also on tuesday, democratic senator claire mccaskill sent a separate letter to dhs asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on kaspersky products.  kaspersky’s consumer anti virus software has won high marks from reviewers.  the company said monday it would submit the source code of its software and future updates for inspection by independent parties.

" german explosives experts defused a massive world war two bomb in the financial capital of frankfurt on sunday after tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. the compulsory evacuation of 60,000 people was germany s biggest such maneuver since the war, with more than a thousand emergency service workers helping to clear the area around the bomb, which was discovered on a building site last week.  the evacuation area included two hospitals, care homes, the opera house and germany s central bank, the bundesbank, where $70 billion in gold reserves are stored underground. police maintained security at the building. the all day effort took longer than planned but officials expressed relief that residents would start returning home before sundown and that the operation wouldn t disrupt business on monday. the work by bomb technicians started later than scheduled because some residents refused to leave the evacuation area despite fire chiefs warning that an uncontrolled explosion would be big enough to flatten a city block. police said they took stragglers into custody to secure the area. more than 2,000 tonnes of live bombs and munitions are discovered each year in germany, more than 70 years after the end of the war.  british and american warplanes pummeled the country with 1.5 million tonnes of bombs that killed 600,000 people. officials estimate that 15 percent of the bombs failed to explode, some burrowing six meters (20 feet) deep. residents were instructed to leave their homes by 8 a.m. local time [0600 gmt], and more than a thousand emergency service workers helped to clear the area. police set up cordons at a 1.5 km (roughly a mile) radius around the device.  many residents left town. others spent time in cafes on the edge of the evacuation zone. museums were free, and many hotels offered discounts. the city set up a temporary shelter at frankfurt s trade fair site, serving bananas and beverages.   the device was found last week in the city s leafy westend neighborhood, home to many wealthy bankers.  premature babies and intensive care patients had to be evacuated along with everyone else from two hospitals and rescue workers helped about 500 elderly people leave residences and care homes. bomb disposal experts used a special system to try and unscrew the fuses attached to the hc 4,000 bomb from a safe distance. if that had failed, a water jet would have been used to cut the fuses. the bomb was dropped by britain s royal air force during the 1939 45 war, city officials said.  in july, a kindergarten was evacuated after teachers discovered an unexploded world war two bomb on a shelf among some toys. three police explosives experts in goettingen were killed in 2010 while preparing to defuse a 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb.

" u.s. president donald trump needs to acknowledge that the extreme interrogation technique known as waterboarding is torture and therefore absolutely prohibited, the u.n. special rapporteur on torture said on monday. “without any doubt, waterboarding amounts to torture,” nils melzer said in a statement, adding that a u.s. revival of torture would be catastrophic because other countries would also “get back into the torture business”. “i urgently appeal to president trump to carefully consider not only u.s. legal obligations, doctrine and tradition, but also the consolidated legal and moral views of the entire international community before allowing the re introduction of methods or interrogation that are more closely associated with barbarism than with civilization,” he said. waterboarding, in which a victim is subjected to simulated drowning to force them to confess or divulge information, was used by the cia on three suspected militants detained in secret foreign prisons during president george w. bush’s administration. but the technique was denounced as torture by president barack obama, other top officials, lawmakers and human rights groups. the u.s. senate also voted to ban it in 2015. trump said last week, however, he feels waterboarding works but he will defer to defense secretary james mattis, who does not “necessarily believe” such techniques work.

" a group of u.s. senators from both parties on wednesday turned up the heat on wells fargo inc. over its latest scandal, in which hundreds of thousands of car loan borrowers were charged each month without their knowledge for collision insurance, which many of them did not need. the republican chairs of the committee and the subcommittee that would head any congressional investigations into insurance sales, senators john thune and jerry moran, along with those panels’ senior democrats, senators bill nelson and richard blumenthal, wrote to wells ceo timothy sloan with questions about the scandal as basic as how many customers were affected. they also requested copies of the bank’s internal report that first identified the problem. the group sent similar questions to barry karfunkel, ceo of national general holdings corporation, which provided the insurance. last week moran said he was seeking additional information from wells about reports the bank charged 800,000 borrowers for insurance without their knowledge or consent, but did not give specifics. many borrowers already had cheaper insurance with other companies. the letter asks sloan when the bank, which paid $190 million in fines and penalties last year over creating phantom bank accounts, first learned about the insurance sales practices and also what steps it is taking to prevent a recurrence and to refund the erroneous charges to customers. the letters do not mention possible hearings or subpoenas, but the senators have the authority launch an investigation using both if they are not satisfied with responses to their letters. wells and national have until aug. 23 to answer the questions. the wells letter shows senators are concerned with reports that thousands of borrowers fell into delinquency because they could not afford the premiums on top of their monthly payments and the possibility bank management pushed employees to sign customers up for insurance with incentives or special benefits.  incentives are at the heart of last year’s scandal, where employees said they created accounts in customers’ names or pushed account holders to buy additional products they did not need in order to meet high sales targets. the senators are also seeking information about possible commissions paid or revenues shared between wells and national. wells spokeswoman jennifer dunn said the bank is committed to addressing the lawmakers’ concerns.  “customer harm is not acceptable at wells fargo,” she said. “we are committed to fixing these mistakes and earning back trust.” ",0
" president donald trump pressed republican congressional leaders on tuesday to complete their overhaul of the u.s. healthcare system as lawmakers said they were making progress on a contentious effort that threatens to overwhelm their legislative agenda.  in a white house meeting, trump welcomed indications by senior republicans that the senate might vote on a healthcare bill in july, before it breaks for the summer, after the house of representatives passed its own version in may. “now the senate i’m sure will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great healthcare and i’m looking forward to seeing it,” trump said. the gathering included senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and his no. 2, senator john cornyn, along with house speaker paul ryan and his deputies, representatives kevin mccarthy and steve scalise. buffeted by criticism on many fronts, trump wants faster action from his fellow republicans who control congress, pressing lawmakers to finish the job of dismantling the obamacare healthcare law and move on quickly to another of his priorities: tax cuts. mcconnell said senate republicans are “getting close” to a healthcare plan after he presented an outline at a lunchtime meeting but he declined to say when he might bring it up for a vote. other senior republicans say they hope to vote by early july. “the leader would like to do this soon,” senator orrin hatch told reporters. the senate requires a 60 vote supermajority to advance most legislation but republican mike enzi, head of the senate budget committee, said the health bill that passed the house qualifies for an expedited process that would require only 51 votes. still, republicans have little margin for error because they only control 52 seats in the 100 seat chamber and remain divided over key questions such as how quickly to scale back the medicaid health plan for the poor. “you have to get 50 people   that means they have to get me and a lot of people who are concerned about medicaid,” said senator shelly moore capito of west virginia, a state that depends heavily on the program. medicaid was expanded under obamacare but the house bill would phase that expansion out in 2020. the senate bill might keep the expansion in place beyond that date, said republican senator john barrasso. whatever the white house’s efforts to push ahead with policy plans, there will be a spotlight on testimony by james comey, the fbi director fired by trump last month, to the senate intelligence committee on thursday. senators will question comey on whether trump tried to get him to back off an fbi investigation into ties between the president’s 2016 campaign and russia, an attempt that critics have said could constitute obstruction of justice. trump denies any collusion with russia and has called the investigation a “witch hunt.” the justice department has appointed a special counsel to oversee its probe into the russia issue and several congressional panels also are investigating the matter.   elected on pledges to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, trump has yet to achieve a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave washington for the august break. there has been little progress on healthcare since the house passed its bill. mcconnell told reuters late last month he did not yet know how to amass the votes needed to pass a bill on  healthcare. he appeared to make some progress on tuesday. some republican lawmakers praised an outline that mcconnell presented at a lunchtime meeting, although they cautioned that much work remained to be done.  senator bill cassidy said the plan offered more protections than the house bill for people who already have pre existing illnesses when they apply for insurance coverage   a major point of contention. “i think personally they are moving in the right direction,” he said. the house healthcare bill could result in 23 million people losing insurance, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office. the bill also would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis.  congress might then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in september. while the administration would prefer that such changes not add to the national debt, marc short, trump’s top aide on capitol hill, told reporters on monday that the top priority would be cutting taxes. the trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. the proposal has been short on details, including how much the tax cuts would cost and what loopholes would be closed. others are eager to move past healthcare as well. “we need to bring this to an end and move to taxes,” said republican senator lindsey graham.

" puerto rico’s governor proposed measures on monday to reduce anticipated budget cuts at the university of puerto rico to $241 million by fiscal year 2021, from $450 million approved by the struggling u.s. territory’s fiscal oversight board. the measures, outlined by governor ricardo rossello in a letter to the board, include transferring to the university some of the savings generated by upcoming cuts to healthcare spending; allowing the university to earn revenue by training public employees; and working with the island’s science and technology trust to monetize the university’s patents, which upr has historically struggled to do. the school’s fate is a sensitive issue locally, with student groups threatening strikes over the cuts. upr’s budget has already been slashed by $348 million over the last three fiscal years, according to rossello’s letter.     its troubles are entangled with broad economic distress in the u.s. territory, where almost half the population lives in poverty and unemployment is more than twice the u.s. average. as the island buckles under $70 billion in debt, public healthcare and pension systems edge toward insolvency, and locals flock to the mainland united states. the territory’s finances are under the oversight of a federally appointed board, which some local critics condemn as  an extension of its colonial legacy. the board’s recommended austerity measures have drawn protests on the island. the board has urged reduced government subsidies, staff cuts and tuition fee hikes at upr, the 11 campus, 70,000 student university that has produced four of the island’s ex governors. the full $450 million cut would be a “dramatic negative” that would be “difficult for the university to absorb,” leaving it with a $157 million operating deficit, moody’s investors service said in a note on monday.  hiking tuition is hard “given the highly price sensitive student population,” moody’s said. it added that while it expects upr to make its $32 million debt payment on june 1, subsequent payments could be missed because the university stopped transferring money into trusts for debt payments under puerto rico’s 2016 emergency debt moratorium. some economists say the school has room to trim fat.  arnaldo cruz, co founder of the san juan based think tank center for integrity and public policy, said upr spends too much on non faculty positions and that its 11 campuses are too many on an island of 3.5 million. “we think that does not make sense on such a small island with a population in decline,” cruz said.

" crop eating fall armyworms have attacked nearly 37,000 hectares of maize in northern cameroon, officials said on wednesday, accentuating an already dire humanitarian crisis provoked by the islamist militant group boko haram s cross border insurgency. more than two dozen african nations have reported outbreaks of the invasive central american variety of the pest, which is harder to detect and eradicate than its african counterpart. they have now spread to all of cameroon s 10 administrative regions, though maize crops in the extreme north region have only been heavily affected since july, deputy agriculture minister clementine ananga messina told reuters.  the armyworm attack endangers the entire maize sector and is creating serious risks of food insecurity, because it s the most commonly grown cereal in cameroon,  she said.  the extreme north region bordering chad and nigeria has been hit hard by boko haram, whose campaign of violence and cross border attacks has sent more than 93,000 nigerians fleeing into cameroon where some 235,000 people have also been displaced. across the lake chad region around 1.5 million people are confronting a food crisis, according to the united nations. cameroonian authorities have launched an action plan to fight against the infestation, but so far pesticides have failed to contain it.   there are no effective means to fight armyworm currently existing in cameroon,  said agriculture ministry expert andre marie elombat assoua.  the chemical products now being used by farmers are ineffective and too expensive.   around 12 million cameroonians, more than half of the national population, regularly consume maize. it is also an important ingredient for the central african nation s breweries and in the production of feed for livestock. though the fall armyworm prefers maize, it also attacked sorghum and millet, two of cameroon s other staple crops, earlier this year.

" syrian and iraqi forces closing in on the last scraps of islamic state s caliphate straddling the remote border area between the two countries have already witnessed the jihadists  likely response. while their comrades mounted last stands in their syrian capital of raqqa and the city of hawija in iraq, is militants seized the syrian town of al qaryatayn and launched its biggest attack for months in ramadi late last month. that is the kind of guerrilla insurgency both countries foresee is turning to.   it is expected that after the daesh terrorist organization s capacity to fight in the field is finished, its remnants will resort to this type of (guerrilla) operation. but for a certain period of time, not forever,  said a syrian military source, using an arabic acronym for islamic state.     the continued ability for is to mount attacks in areas where it was thought to have been eliminated will hinder efforts to stabilize regions when the fighting wanes.  in iraq, where islamic state originated, it has a proven record of falling back upon local networks from which it can rise anew when conditions allow. so far, it has not shown it has the same capacity in syria, and it might find doing so more challenging there than in iraq.  the sectarian divisions on which it thrives are less pronounced in syria, and it faces competition there for jihadist loyalty from other powerful militant groups.  daesh is in essence an iraqi organization, it will survive to some extent in iraq. syrian members will dissolve in other syrian salafi jihadist groups,  said hisham hashami, an adviser on islamic state to the iraqi government. but in both countries it has shown it can exploit holes left by overstretched enemies to carry out spectacular attacks   the one in syria s al qaryatayn most clearly   that spread panic and tie down opposing forces.  it has also proved able to carry out bombings and assassinations in areas controlled by the iraqi and syrian governments, u.s. backed kurdish militias and rival jihadist rebel groups, signaling an ability to survive underground.  a jihadist from a syrian rebel faction opposed to islamic state said the group had won enough support among young men to give it a latent capacity to revive.   i believe that it is possible, given that its ideology has spread widely among the youths, that something new will emerge,  the jihadist said, pointing to the highly effective propaganda machine deployed by islamic state over the last three years. the al qaryatayn attack began on the evening of 29 september, when up to 250 militants with guns, rockets and mortars spread around the area with  terrible speed , said ayman al fayadh, a resident.  it was particularly alarming because the government had declared al qaryatayn safe months ago, and had helped its residents to move back into their homes.  when the jihadists were finally forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al qaryatayn, they took their revenge, slaughtering scores of its inhabitants.  they were very bloodthirsty and didn t spare anyone,  fayadh said.  the syrian military source said it took three weeks to retake the town because it was inhabited and the army was trying to avoid civilian casualties.  however, the attack showed how towns in syria s deserts, where armed forces can be spread only thinly, are vulnerable to islamic state and that such operations can tie down opposing armies.  people are afraid of daesh returning,  said a syrian journalist who visited the town this week.  they killed anyone who had taken part in pro government protests. bodies had been thrown in streets and in wells.  fayadh also said townspeople were among the attackers, indicating that islamic state used its years of rule to build local support networks and establish sleeper cells for future attacks   something that could be replicated elsewhere in syria.   they re going to continue to have to look for places where they can plan and finance and resource and launch their attacks from,  said colonel ryan dillon, spokesman for the u.s. led coalition, noting islamic state had often used  sparsely populated areas .          the assault on ramadi took place three days before. militants attacked iraqi security forces with suicide car bombs, mortars and machine guns in a city that it had apparently lost months earlier. the big challenge in both iraq and syria is to co opt the sunni arab tribes, or risk a revival of jihadist insurgency. the suuni shi ite divide has plagued iraq since the u.s. led invasion in 2003 that ignited the civil war. shi ite parties backed by iran have dominated the government and used militia forces against mostly sunni insurgents. the syrian government may have the same problem. it is allied to the region s main shi ite powers   iran and militia groups such as lebanon s hezbollah   and led by a president, bashar al assad, from a shi ite offshoot sect.  it will also be a challenge for the u.s. backed syrian democratic forces (sdf) alliance in northern syria, which is spearheaded by kurdish groups. they have sometimes struggled to convince arabs that it will protect their interests.   it all depends on the degree to which those fighting under assad and the sdf incorporate settled tribes into governing structures,  said andrew tabler, a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy.      even in northwestern syria, where rebel groups including jihadist factions hold sway, hardship and insurgent infighting might create space for islamic state to again seize ground.  beside the al qaryatayn attack, a group of islamic state fighters have managed to take a pocket of territory in rebel held areas near hama in recent weeks, battling a rival jihadist group for control of several villages.  it has used bomb attacks and assassinations to target government held cities in the west, kurdish security forces in the northeast and islamist rebel factions in the northwest.  in the isolated enclave it holds in yarmouk camp south of damascus, it has also shown renewed aggression, taking over the headquarters of a neighboring rebel group this month by force.  the jihadist rebel said he believed islamic state could repeat the strategy it used in iraq last decade of retrenching when under attack, then rebounding in more virulent form.   in this period of weakness, islamic state depends on the ideology that it spread,  the jihadist said.  it appears that the same experience is being repeated. they could carry out bombings, a guerrilla war.

" the european commission added to mounting confidence in brussels that it is set for a brexit deal with london when it scheduled talks with eu lawmakers ahead of a crunch meeting on monday with theresa may. however, eu officials and diplomats cautioned on sunday that it was still unclear that a deal would be struck with the british prime minister when she meets the eu executive. two hours before they sit down for lunch with may in brussels, commission president jean claude juncker and his brexit negotiator michel barnier will brief guy verhofstadt and his european parliament brexit team, an official said. verhofstadt and his colleagues wrote to the eu negotiators last week to sound an alarm at what they said were  stalled  talks on eu demands that the rights of eu citizens in britain be guaranteed directly by the european court of justice after britain leaves the european union. they also voiced concern about northern ireland. parliament must ratify any treaty on britain s withdrawal from the european union before brexit in march 2019 in order to create the smooth transition period may wants, and so it will be vital to both sides to keep the legislators on board. senior eu officials and diplomats said work was continuing on sunday. one person close to the discussions said the situation was  delicate .  it s still quite fluid,  said a second person involved.  nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.    verhofstadt, a former belgian prime minister and strong critic of brexit, declined to comment. the german leader of the center right group in the eu parliament warned that lawmakers were not yet satisfied.  on brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one,  manfred weber said in a statement.  we are much more concerned about the fact that so far negotiations are stalled on the protection of eu citizens  rights after brexit and on the irish case,  he said. the eu wants outline accords on three critical divorce terms before it will open negotiations on the transition and a future free trade pact that would follow. may s lunch on monday is a deadline for the eu to have her final offers before eu leaders consider whether to agree at a dec. 15 summit to launch phase 2. britain and the eu aim to sign a joint declaration setting out progress toward final deals which the commission, as the eu executive, would say was  sufficient  for opening trade talks. eu officials say terms have been agreed for a financial settlement long resisted by hardline supporters of brexit. the irish prime minister said on saturday that would essentially cover all the 60 billion euros the eu had demanded.  on the second key issue of a deal to avoid a  hard border  on land between britain and the eu across the island of ireland, diplomats say the joint document will set out rules for reaching a border deal aimed at avoiding disruption to peace in the north but leaving open many of the details. the third issue, of citizens  rights, has long seemed the least problematic, but the european parliament s concerns were a reminder of how far the insistence on the ecj having the final say in whether london was respecting the withdrawal treaty conflicts with british demands to be free of eu courts. it was not immediately clear what compromise, if any, has been found. eu governments had also been pressing london to give better terms to eu expatriates on bringing in future family members and on moving social welfare benefits across borders. one suggestion in brussels has been to limit clearly any ecj involvement as a last resort and clearly only available to those eu citizens who choose to go on living in britain before brexit, not to any who arrive later. there are 3 million of them today. looking to show skeptical pro brexit allies that she has secured something in five months of negotiation that seem set to end with london broadly accepting the eu s original terms, may has insisted that brussels make a simultaneous and reciprocal commitment to transition and trade talks if she accepts a deal. that seems set to be the case with the joint declaration.  everyone knows we have to honor politically what the brits have accepted on money,  a senior eu diplomat said.  so on monday they will sign this document.  if all goes to the plan, 27 eu leaders would give the official green light on dec. 15, a day after may has joined them for a routine summit on other eu business.. the deliberately vague concept of  sufficient progress  gives the political leaders the option to leave plenty of room for future negotiation. the key thing for many in brussels is that it should mark the establishment of trust that both sides are willing to work for a separation that is not too disruptive.

" a vote to block the obama administration’s ambitious climate regulation was one of antonin scalia’s last acts as a supreme court justice. his sudden death may have opened a new path to the rule’s survival. scalia died saturday. four days earlier, he voted with the other conservative members of the high court to put a hold on the administration’s plans to implement the clean power plan while it is litigated. the regulation is designed to lower carbon emissions from u.s. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. the rule is the united states’ main tool to meet the emissions reduction target pledge it made at u.n. climate talks in paris in december.  it was challenged by 27 states, along with business and industry groups, in a case now before an appeals court in washington, d.c. the supreme court could be asked to weigh in again later this year. without scalia, the conservative members of the court no longer have a majority, at least in the short term. the sudden shift has given a boost to the supporters of the emissions rule.   “last week, the clean power plan was basically dead,” said brian potts, a lawyer with the foley & lardner law firm who represents companies on environmental regulatory issues. “but with scalia’s death, everything has changed.” environmental lawyers involved in the litigation who support the regulation told reuters monday that even before scalia’s death they had been hopeful the supreme court would ultimately uphold it upon close consideration. but they said the change in the high court bolsters the rule’s chances. “there are still no guarantees, but the clean power plan faces much better odds now than it did on friday,” said jack lienke, a lawyer with the institute for policy integrity at new york university school of law, which backs the regulation. industry lawyers said they remained confident the regulation will be struck down. “while justice scalia’s untimely passing creates more uncertainty, the clean power plan is still predicated on an extraordinarily shaky legal foundation,” said scott segal, a lawyer with the bracewell law firm, which represents companies that oppose the regulation.  in january, a three judge panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit had unanimously rejected the same request for a stay that the supreme court granted last week. the appellate panel has set oral arguments on the merits of the case for june 2. the randomly drawn appeals court panel is viewed by lawyers on both sides as relatively favorable for the administration, featuring two democratic appointees and one republican appointee. one of the democratic appointees is sri srinivasan, a judge many legal experts see as a leading candidate for president barack obama to nominate to replace scalia. if the appeals court upholds the rule and the challengers take the case to the supreme court, they would face an uphill battle in getting the five votes needed for a win without scalia. the four liberal justices are seen as likely to uphold the rule. so, the best result the challengers would be likely to get is a 4 4 split. when the court is evenly divided, the lower court ruling stands, meaning the regulation would survive. an unknown factor is how soon a ninth member will be appointed and whether it will be a democratic or republican president who makes it. some republican leaders have said obama should not appoint a successor, leaving it to the next president, who would take office in january 2017. obama has said he plans to announce a nomination but will face an uphill ban to win confirmation in the republican controlled senate. if a democratic appointee replaces scalia, it would tilt the balance of the court leftward for the first time in decades. a republican appointee would extend the narrow conservative tilt the bench had until scalia’s death. if srinivasan were appointed, he would have to step aside on the clean power plan case because of his involvement in the case at the appellate level. that would increase the chances of a 4 4 split.

" in a post harvey weinstein world, logic would dictate that silvio berlusconi, who hosted wild parties with young women and brags about his sexual prowess, would not have a ghost of a chance at political resurrection. but logic and italian politics have never been synonymous. on monday, the four time former prime minister s right wing bloc relished a huge political victory in regional elections in sicily. silvio, as his die hard adoring acolytes simply call him, was back in the driver s seat.  berlusconi is alive,  was the headline in la verita, a right wing newspaper, on tuesday. the mainstream corriere della sera ran a cartoon showing berlusconi, wrapped in a burial shroud, emerging from a tomb like lazarus in the new testament. the regional sicilian ballot, in which berlusconi s candidate, nello musumeci, won big, was seen as a dry run for nationwide elections due before may. as the 81 year old media tycoon campaigned tirelessly for musumeci, betting that a victory in sicily would be the springboard for a national return to power of the center right, the ex premier s sex scandals were no issue.  unfortunately, this is a country where if one violates rules on sexual ethics, he is admired,  said anna foa, a history professor who is on a team of women who write a monthly edition on women s issues of the vatican newspaper l osservatore romano. earlier this month, british defence secretary michael fallon resigned after admitting touching a radio presenter s knee repeatedly in 2002   relatively tame behavior compared to berlusconi s past sex scandals.  this is a country   and i am sorry to have to say this   where breaking the rules brings votes,  foa said.  everyone wants to be the one who breaks the rules and gets away with it, and berlusconi did this in a sphere that people like best   the sexual sphere.   bunga bunga    the term of uncertain origin that the billionaire media magnate gave to his wild parties with young women at his plush residence near milan   is now part of the modern italian lexicon. partly as a result of the sex scandals, berlusconi went through a very public divorce from his second wife, veronica lario, in 2014. his current partner, francesca pascale, is 49 years his junior. berlusconi is due to stand trial on charges he bribed witnesses to silence them over accusations he paid for sex with young women. in an earlier, related case, he was acquitted of having sex with one when she was still 17. he denies all wrongdoing. but far from being a hindrance, commentators say that in italian politics, scandals can help, if only because voters believe there is little left to hide.  berlusconi is like a used car that comes with a guarantee. you know what you are going to get,  said giovanni orsina, professor of modern history at rome s luiss university.  even a person who is 81 years old and has gone through all these issues and scandals can seem appealing..., not because of his own strength but because of the weaknesses of others.  for now, berlusconi cannot run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. but he hopes the european court of human rights overturns this ban in time for him to run next year. even if the courts deny him the chance, he would still be calling the shots as leader of the center right in the event of a victory at the national elections. more than 50 women have accused hollywood mogul harvey weinstein of having sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. he has denied having non consensual sex with anyone. the allegations against weinstein have prompted many more women as well as men to share stories in the media about improper behavior by powerful men in their countries. not so in italy, where women have for the most part remained silent despite confidential polls showing that many were asked for sexual favors in order to keep their jobs or advance their careers.  we are still a backwards country where women who speak out about sexual abuse are accused of exaggerating,  said michela marzano, an italian philosopher who teaches at paris descartes university.  there is an unconscious adoption of the concept of a patriarchal order and male superiority and there is very little solidarity among women.

" the trump administration has rolled out a new questionnaire for u.s. visa applicants worldwide that asks for social media handles for the last five years and biographical information going back 15 years. the new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would be visitors to the united states, was approved on may 23 by the office of management and budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.  critics argued that the new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the united states. under the new procedures, consular officials can request all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (bit.ly/2qbsrpv) officials will request the additional information when they determine “that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting,” a state department official said on wednesday. the state department said earlier the tighter vetting would apply to visa applicants “who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security related visa ineligibilities.” president donald trump has vowed to increase national security and border protections, proposing to give more money to the military and make mexico pay to build a wall along the southern u.s. border. he has tried to implement a temporary travel ban on people from six muslim majority nations that a u.s. appeals court refused to reinstate, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the supreme court. the office of management and budget granted emergency approval for the new questions for six months, rather than the usual three years.  while the new questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of an individual visa application. immigration lawyers and advocates say the request for 15 years of detailed biographical information, as well as the expectation that applicants remember all their social media handles, is likely to catch applicants who make innocent mistakes or do not remember all the information requested.  the new questions grant “arbitrary power” to consular officials to determine who gets a visa with no effective check on their decisions, said babak yousefzadeh, a san francisco based attorney and president of the iranian american bar association. “the united states has one of the most stringent visa application processes in the world,” yousefzadeh said. “the need for tightening the application process further is really unknown and unclear.” ",0
" the illinois house passed $817 million in spending on thursday to provide “life line” funding to higher education and social service and health programs that have been starved for cash due to the state’s budget impasse. the measure passed in a 64 45 vote over republican governor bruce rauner’s opposition to another stopgap spending measure. a six month temporary budget for the fiscal year that ends june 30 expired on dec. 31. illinois is limping towards the end of a second straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a stalemate between rauner and democrats who control the legislature. the country’s fifth largest state has been operating on continuing appropriations and court ordered spending, while its pile of unpaid bills reached nearly $13 billion on wednesday. the bill would tap money from the state’s commitment to human services and education assistance funds to direct $258 million to pay for dozens of programs, including senior meals  and crime prevention, and indigent burials. another $559 million would go to state universities, community colleges, and educational grants for low income students. the bill’s sponsor, democratic state representative greg harris, said the so called life line measure would allow social service organizations and state universities “to continue to exist.” he cited a united way survey released on wednesday that showed 69 percent of social service agencies had received no payments or partial payments from the state so far in fiscal 2017, forcing 49 percent of the agencies to reduce services.  he said universities had resorted to program cuts and layoffs. republican lawmakers contended that passage of a stopgap measure would take the pressure off the legislature to finally pass a full budget. “the reality is we don’t do things around here without pressure,” said republican state representative steven andersson. the measure will now head to the senate, which is on break until april 25. a spokesman for democratic senate president john cullerton said the bill would be reviewed. earlier on thursday, rauner voiced opposition to another stopgap budget. “we’ve been doing that for decades, and it’s created the crisis and mess we’re in,” he told reporters in decatur. “that’s a failure to do stopgaps. let’s do a balanced budget so the problem is fixed.”  after a bipartisan bill package aimed at ending the impasse stalled in the senate last month, credit rating agencies warned that illinois’ credit ratings, the lowest among the 50 states, could sink even lower.

" a group of texas business leaders urged state lawmakers on monday to abandon plans to pass a bill to restrict bathroom access for transgender people, calling such a measure bad for the economy. the republican dominated legislature begins a 30 day special session on tuesday with 20 items on the agenda, including one of the “bathroom bills” that have been a flashpoint in u.s. culture wars. supporter of the legislation have said it is a common sense measure that protects public safety. critics call it discriminatory. texas, the most powerful republican controlled state, could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 and businesses could find it difficult to recruit top talent if such a measure is enacted, according to the state’s leading employer organization. “the distraction of a bathroom bill pulls us away from being competitive as a state,” jeff moseley, chief executive of the texas association of business, told a rally outside the capitol.  “on this discussion, conservatives can disagree with conservatives,” said moseley, whose group has typically aligned itself with the state’s republican leaders. the legislation restricts access to places like bathrooms and locker rooms based on the gender listed on people’s birth certificates and not the gender with which they identify. a similar law in north carolina, partially repealed in march, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that was estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. the stakes are higher in texas, which has an economy larger than russia’s. a bill similar to north carolina’s passed the texas senate in the regular session and was killed by pro business republican leaders in the house, who ran out the clock on the measure. the bathroom bill’s main backer, republican lieutenant governor dan patrick, a social conservative who sets the state senate’s legislative agenda, has said economic losses would be inconsequential. “(the texas republican majority) want to maintain separate restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities for men and women and boys and girls, and they don’t care if the media thinks it is politically incorrect,” his political campaign said in a statement on monday. republican house of representatives speaker joe straus and companies including ibm, american airlines, apple and southwest airlines have spoken out against the bill. “on the bathroom bill, there is no real compromise because even the most mild bill is going to be interpreted as discriminatory,” said mark jones, a political science professor at rice university in houston.

" the obama administration is not pursuing the use of an executive order to shutter the guantanamo bay military prison after officials concluded that it would not be a viable strategy, sources familiar with the deliberations said. the conclusion, reached by administration officials, narrows the already slim chances that president barack obama can fulfill his pledge to close the  notorious offshore prison before leaving office in january. the white house has said repeatedly that obama has not ruled out any options on the guantanamo center, which has been used to house terrorism suspects since it was set up in 2001 following the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington. obama is eager to fulfill his 2008 campaign pledge to close the prison and could still choose to use his commander in chief powers, but the option is not being actively pursued, the sources said. without executive action, the chances of closing the prison would hinge on convincing a resistant congress to overturn a long standing ban on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners to maximum security prisons in the united states.  white house lawyers and other officials studied the option of overriding the ban but did not develop a strong legal position or an effective political sales pitch in an election year, a source familiar with the discussions said.  “it was just deemed too difficult to get through all of the hurdles that they would need to get through, and the level of support they were likely to receive on it was thought to be too low to generate such controversy, particularly at a sensitive (time) in an election cycle,” the source said. republicans in congress are opposed to bringing guantanamo detainees to u.s. prisons and have expressed opposition to transfers to other countries over concern that released prisoners will return to militant activities. they have vowed to challenge any potential obama executive action in court. at its peak, the prison at the u.s. naval base in cuba housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the “war on terror” and synonymous with criticism of detention without trial and accusations of torture. obama has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists. the number of guantanamo detainees has fallen to 80 now, the lowest since it was opened.  the administration is focusing on getting the number of detainees at the prison down to such a low number, perhaps 20, that the cost of keeping it open could prove unpalatable to congress. republican lawmakers remain unswayed. the guantanamo prison and associated military commissions cost $445 million in fiscal year 2015. that works out to more than $5.5 million a year for each of the 80 remaining prisoners. thirty of the remaining detainees at guantanamo have been approved for transfer to foreign countries and the state department says it will move all of them out this summer. those who would be left include 10 being prosecuted in military commissions, and other detainees deemed too dangerous to release or transfer. “the administration’s goal is to work with congress to find a solution to close guantanamo,” said myles caggins, a spokesman for the white house national security council. he said the government had made “substantial progress”  moving prisoners to foreign countries and was working to identify more countries for additional transfers. reviews to determine whether certain prisoners need to remain detained to prevent a threat to u.s. security had been accelerated and would be completed in the coming months, he said. obama, who issued an order to shut the prison within a year on his first day in office, released his latest plan to close it to congress in february, but it has not gained traction. the white house has not publicly ruled out the executive order option in part to keep pressure on the pentagon to move prisoners who have been cleared for release to other countries, one of the sources said. “if congress ... would finally say no to the president’s plan and the executive order option wasn’t on the table, there was a concern that the wheels could grind to a halt,” said the source familiar with discussions at the white house. gregory craig, who served as obama’s first white house counsel, said that without an executive order, obama would likely need the cooperation of congress to shut down the prison. “i think the odds are probably challenging,” craig said.

" u.s. lawmakers in the house armed services committee began debating an annual defense policy bill on wednesday that would shift $18 billion in pentagon war funding to other military needs. the proposed legislation would use the $18 billion to halt cuts to the size of the military and boost training and maintenance in an effort to improve u.s. military readiness. the funding shift would leave $35.7 billion to pay for u.s. military efforts in afghanistan, iraq and syria. the house panel said that was enough to last through april 2017, giving the next president time to evaluate the security situation and make a supplemental budget request to congress. representative madeleine bordallo, a democrat from guam, said she was “concerned that the short sighted budget gimmick ... may leave our troops short of funding required in the near future.” but representative mac thornberry, chairman of the committee, said that while “some people may call it a gimmick,” the democratic majority in 2008 had done something very similar. the u.s. military has warned repeatedly in recent years that ongoing efforts to trim nearly $1 trillion from projected defense budgets over a decade have forced it to postpone training, maintenance and upkeep. the measure, the national defense authorization act, sets u.s. defense policy and authorizes, but does not appropriate, funding for the pentagon. lawmakers in the house panel expected to vote on the final version early on thursday, after which it will go to the full house of representatives. the draft bill unveiled by thornberry this week would authorize $610.5 billion in defense spending for the 2017 fiscal year beginning in october. that total is in line with the defense spending plan proposed by obama earlier this year. the proposal calls for an active duty army of 480,000 troops, which is 20,000 more than proposed in the president’s budget request. it also seeks significant reforms in the organization of the defense department, including expanding the term and the advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. during debates on the legislation, lawmakers approved an amendment that calls for a senior u.s. defense official to be placed in charge of developing directed energy weapons. the u.s. military hopes directed energy weapons will provide it with an asymmetric advantage over potential rivals, for example enabling it to counter million dollar missiles with a weapon that fires projectiles costing only $25,000.

" nigeria s court of appeal on tuesday dismissed 15 charges against the senate president related to alleged false declarations of assets, but it upheld three other charges against him. bukola saraki s three year tenure as president of the upper house has been marred by numerous accusations of misconduct and investigations, though none have led to convictions. the original charges are related to allegations that saraki falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from 2003 to 2011, to which he pleaded not guilty. a code of conduct tribunal cleared the senate president of the charges in june, saying the case against him lacked substance. the government mounted a legal challenge which led to tuesday s ruling by the court of appeal that saraki should be retried by the tribunal on three of the 18 charges against him.  the three counts relate to saraki s acquisition of two houses in ikoyi, an upmarket district in the southern commercial metropolis of lagos.   the appeal is dismissed in part in respects of the other 15 counts , said the judge, tinuade akomolafe wilson, at the appeal court in the capital abuja. the senate president s camp has previously denied any wrongdoing and on tuesday issued a statement in which it said saraki had been  victorious  due to the 15 charges being dropped. the full details of the judgement on the final three charges against saraki have not been released and will be addressed by his lawyers once they have been, the senate president said in a statement. saraki ran unopposed for the post of senate president, mainly with the backing of the opposition. he was not the ruling party s preferred candidate, which led to strains in his relationship with president muhammadu buhari. the senate president has been dogged by legal cases since taking office.  in october 2016 saraki was cleared of altering senate rules to get himself elected, and in march this year lawmakers cleared him of any wrongdoing over allegations that he attempted to evade payment of customs duties on a car.

" transylvania may not seem everyone s idea of a fun weekend away to get over a painful break up but that is jean claude juncker s prescription for eu leaders to cope with the blues on the day britain walks out. sibiu, the picturesque historic home of romania s ethnic germans, will be just the place for the other 27 national leaders to make a public show of unity on saturday, march 30, 2019, the european commission president told eu lawmakers on wednesday in his annual state of the european union address. his proposals for a more united bloc without britain face scepticism from many governments. but the eu s chief executive has, officials said, calculated that expanding the euro zone and deepening its cooperation can win support from angela merkel and emmanuel macron, leaders of the founding powers france and germany, and heal rifts with newer, poorer members in the east. his mention of brexit brought cheers from uk independence party members in strasbourg. they scoffed at juncker s warning that britons would soon regret leaving and said ukip would look forward to that weekend 18 months hence to celebrate britain s  liberation  from what they call eu diktat from brussels. but aides say juncker believes many of the 440 million other europeans will only truly wake up to the fact the second ranked economy is leaving pretty much around when it actually happens.  and to reassure them at what juncker said would be  a very sad and tragic moment , their leaders should plan a get together in romania, one of the newest, and poorest member states, which just happens to be the rotating chair of the eu in early 2019. a rich cultural heritage   juncker noted that german speakers like himself know it as hermannstadt, capital of transylvania s centuries old saxon community   makes sibiu a good spot to celebrate the union of europe s diverse peoples.  the whole idea on that day is to focus on...matters to come for the union, not on the ones who are leaving,  one senior eu official said of the sibiu summit, which was welcomed by romanian president klaus ioannis, a former mayor of the city. and if hostile british commentators might be tempted to link the transylvanian venue to a view of the eu as a bloodsucking vampire on the british taxpayer, romanian locals insist their town has little to do with the region s dracula legend. aside from altering the atmospherics of what will certainly be a historic weekend for the european union, the success of juncker s vision for sibiu in 2019 will depend on how national leaders respond to the proposals he sketched out on wednesday. most strikingly, the former luxembourg premier who will step down in autumn 2019, wants to use the departure of the union s opter out in chief, britain, to end a culture of states picking and choosing which bits of integration they want   for themselves and others   and to bring all 27 or more nations in to the euro currency zone, schengen travel area and bank union. in a speech that carefully balanced indirect criticisms and praise for different leaders across the bloc, he slapped down macron s embryonic proposals for a separate euro zone budget and plans to push ahead with deeper integration that could leave non euro countries, especially in the east, on the eu s fringes. the german government, preparing for an election in two weeks that should hand merkel a fourth term, is skeptical of macron s plans but is also likely to be wary of the ambition of juncker s proposals. its initial reaction was restrained. eu officials, however, play down the idea that juncker is making for a head on confrontation with merkel and macron when he sets his face against a  multispeed europe  that the veteran eu dealmaker believes bears the seeds of the eu s unraveling. rather, juncker sees his idea of a euro zone covering the whole eu, with its budget part of the overall eu budget and run from the existing commission, as a practical application of the kind of suggestions macron and merkel seem to support but on which their administrations have offered little concrete detail. at the same time, eu officials argue, past attempts by paris and berlin to force a lead on integration, such as by merkel and then president nicolas sarkozy at the height of the euro zone crisis in 2011, failed to gain traction. juncker, they say, will try to persuade them that his broader approach is more viable. nonetheless, his suggestion that the likes of poland and hungary, run by deeply eurosceptic governments, should join the strictures of the euro zone is unlikely to win rapid support in warsaw or budapest. juncker s argument is, however, that if they refuse offers and pressure to join, they cannot then complain about being treated as  second class  members of the union. juncker, 62, said he had despaired of the eu at times but wants sibiu to offer eu voters something other than brexit to wake up to, two months before a european parliament election. the biggest challenge to achieving his long list of ambitions by then will be overcoming entrenched national interests:  democracy is about compromise,  he said in a blunt warning to the squabbling leaders he wants to come together in transylvania.  europe cannot function without compromise.

" new york mayor bill de blasio proposed a retirement plan for private sector workers and a new light rail system in his state of the city speech on thursday, while indicating that social inequality was decreasing under his administration. the democratic mayor of the united states’ biggest city has been in office for a little over two years. he came to power promising to narrow the inequality gap that he said had created “a tale of two cities” after three four year terms of his predecessor, michael bloomberg. de blasio pressed that message again in his keynote speech on thursday: “we see the ‘tale of two cities’ transforming into ‘one new york,’” he said during the speech at a performing arts center in the bronx. new york has a glamorous reputation but is home to many poor neighborhoods. rising real estate prices have made the city less affordable for many residents. a plan to build a $2.5 billion light rail system linking brooklyn and queens, leaked to the news media a day earlier, was the boldest element in the speech for a mayor who has tended to favor social policy over infrastructure. the 16 mile (26 km) track would run from the borough of queens’ astoria neighborhood, tracing a line along the east river and new york’s upper harbor, to link up with brooklyn’s sunset park section. it would pass through popular brooklyn neighborhoods like williamsburg and brooklyn heights. the mayor also called for the city to develop a retirement system for private sector employees, addressing the low rate of retirement savings, especially among low income workers. “we absolutely do not accept a status quo where people work all their lives only to be left with nothing,” said de blasio, echoing previous calls for a better deal for workers. he also outlined plans to develop governors island, an underutilized area of land in the upper harbor off the southern tip of manhattan that had been used as a military base until the city acquired it in 2010. de blasio highlighted his push for a $15 dollar minimum wage, a movement that has gained traction with democrats nationally, and called for his initiatives to introduce paid parental and sick leave to be adopted nationally. de blasio shifted the speech to 7 p.m. (0000 gmt) from its usual daytime spot in the hope of reaching more new yorkers.

" leaders of france, italy and the united kingdom urged social media companies on wednesday to more swiftly remove  terrorist content  from the internet, with the aim of stopping it from being uploaded in the first place.  the tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online,  british prime minister theresa may said in a speech to the united nations general assembly of world leaders in new york. she said there was a need  to increase significantly the efforts to stop (extremist content) being uploaded in the first place.  french president emmanuel macron and italian prime minister paolo gentiloni later pushed in a separate event hosted by may for such content to be removed swiftly.  this is what must be done. in one hour the content must be identified, analyzed and withdrawn to avoid it being broadcast widely. experience shows that this is possible,  said macron, speaking through an interpreter.  we have a real battlefield for hearts and minds and (it) is the web,  gentiloni said. he said economic and privacy issues were a hurdle in this process,  but we also have to know, if we are aware of the fact that this battlefield is so relevant, that we can t reduce our ambition because of the difficulties.  several websites across the internet list ingredients for making bombs or instructions on how to use vehicles to attack pedestrians. online retailer amazon.com said on wednesday it was reviewing its website after an investigation found it could help users buy the ingredients to make a bomb using its  frequently bought together  and  customers who bought this also bought  features. the european union has threatened legislation if internet companies do not better police what is available on the web.  removing all of this content within a few hours   or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place   poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge,  said kent walker, general counsel for alphabet inc s google.  the haystacks here are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing.  walker spoke on behalf of facebook inc, microsoft corp, google subsidiary youtube and twitter inc, all members of the global internet forum to counter terrorism created in june under pressure from governments in europe and the united states after a spate of militant attacks. its aim is to share technical solutions for removing extremist content and work more closely with counter terrorism experts. walker said between august 2015 and june 2017, twitter had suspended almost a million accounts for the promotion of terrorism, and that the use of technology and artificial intelligence had allowed facebook to root out  terrorist clusters.

" the u.s. justice department has gathered enough evidence to charge six members of the russian government in the hacking of democratic national committee computers before the 2016 u.s. presidential election, the wall street journal reported on thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation. federal agents and prosecutors in washington, philadelphia, pittsburgh and san francisco have been cooperating on the dnc investigation and prosecutors could bring the case to court next year, it said. by identifying individual russian military and intelligence hackers with charges, u.s. authorities could make it difficult for them to travel, but arrests and jailing would be unlikely, according to the journal report. the hacking investigation, conducted by cybersecurity experts, predates the appointment in may of federal special counsel robert mueller to oversee the probe of alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with president donald trump’s campaign. mueller and the justice department agreed to allow the technical cyber investigation to continue under the original team of agents and prosecutors, the journal said. u.s. intelligence agencies have said russian intelligence agencies were behind those cyber attacks, which resulted in thousands of emails and other documents being made public by wikileaks last year. the intelligence community concluded in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered the campaign to sway the election in trump’s favor. russia has denied it meddled in the election and trump has denied that his campaign colluded with the russian government. if the case is brought by federal prosecutors, it would pinpoint the specific russian military and intelligence hackers behind the attack on the dnc and the emails of john podesta, who was campaign chairman for trump’s democratic opponent, hillary clinton. it would be the second time the united states charged russians with cyber crimes. in march, the justice department  charged two russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million yahoo accounts.

" president elect donald trump’s spokesman said on thursday there will be an announcement on whether the united states will move its embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem. “stay tuned,” incoming white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters, asked about the issue at a briefing the day before trump takes office. “there’ll be a further announcement on that.” while campaigning for the presidency, trump pledged to switch the embassy from tel aviv, where it has been located for 68 years, to jerusalem. the proposal drew an outcry from palestinians and others who said it would kill any prospect for peace. palestinians view east jerusalem as the capital of a future state and the status of the city is one of the most sensitive issues in the israel palestinian dispute. the united states and other countries do not regard jerusalem as israel’s capital. other nations’ embassies are located in tel aviv and do not recognize israel’s annexation of arab east jerusalem following its capture in the 1967 middle east war. trump has criticized the obama administration as not being friendly enough to the longtime u.s. ally.  the obama administration has been highly critical of israeli settlement construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem. most countries view all israeli settlements on occupied land that the palestinians seek for their own state as illegal. “the president (trump) has made it very clear that israel has not gotten the attention it deserves or the respect in the last eight years. he intends to really show his respect for israel, the importance of it in the middle east,” spicer said.

" u.s. president barack obama will meet the dalai lama at the white house on wednesday, a move certain to anger china which considers the exiled tibetan buddhist spiritual leader a dangerous separatist. obama and the dalai lama will meet privately at 10:15 a.m. (1415 gmt), a white house statement said. earlier on tuesday, china warned the united states to stick by its promises not to support any separatist activities. in an interview with reuters on monday, the dalai lama had said it was possible he would meet obama and on tuesday taiwan announced that its new president would make a transit stop in the united states next week. chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said both issues touched on the “one china” policy, a basic diplomatic tenet referring to both taiwan and tibet being part of china that beijing insists foreign governments recognize. lu said the united states had said it opposed taiwan’s independence and recognized that tibet was an inseparable part of china. “we demand the u.s. government earnestly stands by its promises, conscientiously handle the relevant issue in accordance with the one china principle and not give any space to any individual or behavior which tries to create two chinas, one china one taiwan, or to split china,” he said. obama met the dalai lama when the latter visited washington in 2014 and angered china then when he vowed “strong support” for tibetans’ human rights. the dalai lama says he wants genuine autonomy for tibet rather than independence. he told reuters obama was a “a long time friend” whom he admired for his work to normalize relations with cuba, on iran and for his recent visits to former u.s. foe vietnam and the site of the hiroshima atomic bombing in japan.  asked how beijing (peking) might respond to a meeting, the dalai lama said: “i don’t know   you should ask them. i think in peking, we cannot as of now ... generalize. in peking there are different views. some people there have a more realistic view. some are more hardline, which is more narrow minded.”  taiwan president tsai ing wen will transit in miami on her way to panama, one of the island’s few diplomatic allies, and stop over in los angeles on her return, taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, javier ching shan hou, said. china is suspicious of tsai, who assumed office last month, as she is also head of the pro independence democratic progressive party. travel abroad is sensitive for taiwanese leaders who have angered china as it is seen as exerting sovereignty. tsai’s trip will run from june 24 to july 2 and include paraguay.

" u.s. senate democrats on wednesday narrowly blocked legislation that would slow the entry of refugees from syria and iraq to the united states in a contentious vote cloaked in presidential election year politics. the vote was 55 43, with “yes” votes falling short of the 60 needed to advance the republican backed measure in the 100 member senate. no republicans voted against the bill, and only two democrats backed it. among other things, the bill would halt the admission of refugees and require high level u.s. officials to verify that each refugee from iraq and syria posed no security risk before being allowed into the united states. republicans said the tighter screening was essential to ensure the safety of americans and prevent attacks within the country by islamic state and other militant groups. “this bipartisan bill would allow washington to step back, take a breath and ensure it has the correct policies and security screenings in place,” republican majority leader mitch mcconnell said in the senate before the vote. democrats called the legislation an attack on people who  are fleeing war. they accused republicans of holding the vote to allow their 2016 presidential candidates serving in the senate to back legislation touted as tough on security. all three senate republican 2016 presidential hopefuls, ted cruz, rand paul and marco rubio, backed the bill. democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders missed the vote. democrats also sought to play politics. they tried and failed to reach a deal with republicans to set up a vote on an amendment establishing a religious test for would be immigrants. that vote was planned to see if republicans would side against presidential candidate donald trump, who has advocated barring muslims from entering the united states.   the syria refugee bill passed the house by a large margin days after the nov. 13 islamic state attacks in paris. the bill was supported by dozens of democrats who defied democratic president barack obama’s veto threat. “we need to talk about efforts to defeat isis, not creating more paperwork for cabinet secretaries,” harry reid, the senate democratic leader, told reporters before the vote. it currently takes 18 24 months for syrian refugees to be screened before they can move to the united states. washington has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing war in syria and iraq than many of its closest allies in europe and the middle east. obama announced last year that he would admit 10,000 syrians.

" u.s. president donald trump honored military veterans in washington on saturday at a kennedy center event that resembled both a political rally and an evangelical christian religious service ahead of the july 4 independence day holiday. using the podium again to lash out at the news media, trump worked to energize evangelicals in his political base, noting that the u.s. currency was inscribed with the words: “in god we trust.” “since the signing of the declaration of independence 241 years ago, america always affirmed that liberty comes from our creator. our rights are given to us by god, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away,” he said. attendees at the event for veterans waved miniature american flags from their seats in the theater and raised their hands as a sign of praise while a large choir sang ahead of trump’s remarks. the president praised veterans from each of the u.s. military branches and highlighted his administration’s work to reform veterans’ services. trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in bedminster, new jersey, flew back to washington for the rally but did not spend the night at the white house, preferring to return to bedminster. later, in a rare late night post on twitter, which he uses prolifically and sometimes controversially, trump wrote: “we will always take care of our great veterans. you have shed your blood, poured your love, and bared your soul, in defense of our country.” trump has held campaign like rallies regularly during his first few months in the white house and kicked off his own re election campaign far earlier than other incumbents in recent history. part of his strategy to connect with his supporters has included criticizing the media, and he included harsh words for the press again in his remarks. “the fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them,” he said. “the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house. but i’m president, and they’re not.”  ",0
" chinese importers of foreign publications must verify the products are legal, china said on friday, weeks after a british academic publisher which blocked access to hundreds of scholarly articles in the country reposted the material. cambridge university press (cup) said in august that it had removed some 300 papers and book reviews published in the china quarterly journal from its website in china following a request from the chinese government.  it said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics, including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests, the 1960s cultural revolution and tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in the country. the move sparked an outcry from academics, who attacked the decision as an affront to academic freedom. cup, the publishing arm of britain s elite cambridge university, later reversed its decision and reposted the articles. china s state council information office, responding by fax two weeks after a reuters request for comment, said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law.  all publications imported into china s market must adhere to chinese laws and regulations. publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications,  it said without elaborating. it did not mention cup. at the time, china s education ministry, foreign ministry, cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment. the ruling communist party s efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed. in 2009, software designed to check pornographic and violent images on pcs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat garfield, dishes of flesh colour cooked pork and on one search engine a close up of film star johnny depp s face. but under president xi jinping, beijing has stepped up censorship, tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, and reasserted party authority over academia and other institutions.

" democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s probability of winning the white house got a modest bump in online betting markets on tuesday, a day after her debate with republican donald trump. the price for a contract favoring clinton on the popular predictit betting market was up 2 cents from monday’s post debate closing and implied a 68 percent probability that she would win the nov. 8 election.  although during the debate clinton was as high as 70 percent, her monday night closing of 66 matched the highest closing number since her health took a stumble on sept. 11. a pro trump contract on tuesday indicated his probability for victory was 34 percent. trading in both contracts remained brisk on the heels of the first of three debates. predictit contracts are priced from 0 to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability a candidate will win the election. initially, the price swings for both candidates were the largest since early august, though a substantial portion of clinton’s gain and trump’s fall had been retraced by early afternoon on tuesday. the swing following the debate put the brakes on a big trump price rally on predictit that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. on predictit, the implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 percent heading into the debate from 28 percent at the end of august.  clinton’s prospects also showed comparable improvement on betting sites based in ireland and the united kingdom. uk based betfair called the debate for clinton based on odds movements on its platform, where more than 3 million pounds were bet during the event.  the implied probability of a clinton win in november climbed to 69 percent on betfair, the strongest it has been since her prospects took a hit over her pneumonia diagnosis this month. trump’s probability fell to 30 percent from 37 percent. on ireland’s paddypower, clinton’s odds also had shortened, or improved, to 2 to 5 from 1 to 2 in the early moments of monday’s debate. trump’s odds, which initially lengthened following the debate, had shortened modestly to 2 to 1.

" liberia s supreme court cleared the way for a presidential run off election, ruling on thursday that it had not found enough evidence of fraud to halt the whole process. ex soccer star george weah will now face off against vice president joseph boakai in a vote that could mark liberia s first peaceful transition of power in seven decades. the court dismissed a complaint from the third place finisher charles brumskine s liberty party, which had said fraud had undermined the first round of voting in october.  in the absence of sufficient evidence, the court cannot order a re run of the election,  justice philip banks said, reading out the court s decision.  there were over 5,000 polling places, (so) to present evidence of just a few is problematic,  the judge said.  the evidence should have (shown) ... that they were committed in such magnitude that they could have altered the results.  the winner of round two will replace nobel peace prize laureate ellen johnson sirleaf as leader of the small west african country, one of the world s poorest despite abundant diamonds and iron ore.  the delays caused by all the legal wrangling have ratcheted up tensions in a country still recovering from decades of civil war that killed tens of thousands.  however, a spokesman for the liberty party said it would accept the result.  if we did not respect the judiciary, we would not have come,  darius dillion said.  liberia has won, our democracy has won.  liberians are eager for change after johnson sirleaf s 12 year rule, which sealed a lasting peace that many doubted was possible, but which has failed to tackle corruption or significantly lift living standards of the country s poorest. authorities still have to name a date for the run off. nec spokesman henry flomo told reporters outside the court he believed one could be held in two weeks, but said the date would be announced shortly.  the judges made the ruling with a 4 1 majority.

" south sudan s army clashed with rebels in an oil producing region early on sunday, both sides said, shattering a ceasefire hours after it came into effect.  both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of koch in unity state. seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. there were no immediate details of casualties. the government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on thursday in the latest attempt to end a four year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. the ceasefire formally came into force on sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by reuters.   our forces came under heavy fire this morning in koch county,  dickson gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said.  our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them,  he added in a statement. rebel spokesman lam paul gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town.  the world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after president salva kiir sacked his deputy, riek machar.  the dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to kiir, who is dinka, and machar, who is nuer.  the violence, which the united nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.  earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine.

" the californian republican party voted on sunday to extend its term limit to allow the former lawmaker who brought the party back from near bankruptcy in an increasingly democratic state to seek a third term as chairman. buoyed by a flush bank account and the prospect that members’ votes will matter in a presidential primary for the first time in decades, gop members at their annual convention near san francisco voted for a change to longtime party bylaws to allow former state senator jim brulte to run again next year to be the party’s chairman. “i think he’s a great chairman and he’s done a lot for the party,” said michael escoto, 35, a delegate from los angeles. brulte’s strong hand guiding normally fractious california republicans was clear throughout the three day convention, where newly energized members were courted by all three candidates vying for the national party’s presidential nomination   donald trump, john kasich and ted cruz   along with carly fiorina, who is joining cruz’ campaign as his potential running mate. since brulte took the helm of the then faltering party in 2013, the california gop has gone from having less than $200,000 in the bank to its current cash on hand of $4.5 million, according to state campaign finance records. now, positions cut during layoffs a few years ago have been replaced, and the party’s annual convention   previously a sleepy affair   was packed with delegates and guests. the possibility that california’s june primary will matter in the presidential race for the first time in decades if frontrunner donald trump does not secure enough delegates before then has energized members. on friday, anti trump protesters blocked the road to the hyatt regency hotel near san francisco international airport where the convention was held, engaging in scuffles with police and throwing eggs a day after chaotic demonstrations against the candidate in orange county. inside, his speech drew a standing ovation, as did appearances later in the weekend by kasich, cruz and fiorina.       still, brulte will face a difficult road in a state where democrats hold all statewide elected offices and dominate both houses of the legislature.  the californian republic party has become fractured, splitting among tea party conservatives, anti immigration activists, libertarians and an increasingly alienated moderate old guard. there were just under 4.8 million republicans registered in the state as of jan. 3, bringing the total down to 27.6 percent of the electorate from 30.4 percent in 2012.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton leads her republican rival donald trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, down from a peak this month of 12 points, according to the reuters/ipsos daily tracking poll released on friday.  don’t miss: not enough money for a 'real' coffins in venezuela carl icahn says he didn't sell herbalife shares  burkini controversy goes on in france the aug. 22 25 opinion poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported clinton ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election, while 36 percent supported trump. some 23 percent would not pick either candidate and answered “refused,” “other” or “wouldn’t vote.”  clinton, a former secretary of state, has led real estate developer trump in the poll since democrats and republicans ended their national conventions and formally nominated their presidential candidates in july. her level of support has varied between 41 and 45 percent during that period, and her lead over trump in the tracking poll peaked this month at 12 percentage points on tuesday.  during the past week, clinton has been dogged by accusations by trump, which she has denied, that donations to her family’s charitable foundation influenced her actions while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. questions have also surfaced again about her use of a private email server and address rather than a government one during her period at the state department.  meanwhile, trump and clinton also sparred over who would be a better advocate for african americans and other minorities, and trump hinted he could soften his hard line stance on immigration.   in a separate reuters/ipsos poll that includes candidates from small, alternative parties, clinton leads the field by a smaller margin. some 39 percent of likely voters supported clinton in the four way poll, compared with 36 percent for trump, 7 percent for libertarian candidate gary johnson and 3 percent for green party nominee jill stein.  both polls were conducted online in english in all 50 states. they included 1,154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.  the results may differ from the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project, which includes a separate weekly tracking poll that measures support for the major party candidates in every state and washington d.c.  the states of the nation, released on wednesday, estimated that if the election were held now clinton would have a 95 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 108 votes in the electoral college, the body that decides the election through a count of the candidates’ wins in each state.

" european union lawmakers have raised concerns over money laundering in malta and the independence of its police and judiciary in a draft resolution, stepping up pressure on the island after the assassination of an investigative journalist. daphne caruana galizia, who had denounced high profile corruption and accused prime minister joseph muscat of wrongdoing, was killed on oct. 16 by a bomb that tore through her car.  an investigation is under way and muscat has promised that everything will be done to find the killers. next week the eu parliament will vote on a resolution on the rule of law in malta. in a draft text, seen by reuters, the parliament said it  regrets that developments in malta in recent years have led to serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media and the independence of the police and judiciary . it said that  the independence of law enforcement and the judiciary in malta may be compromised by the fact that the government is empowered to appoint the police commissioner, the head of the fiau (anti money laundering agency) and the attorney general . the resolution called on the european commission to oversee more closely respect for the rule of law in malta and regretted the eu executive s decision not to publish its anti corruption report this year. at a news conference on friday, the largest group in the parliament, the conservative european people s party (epp), called on the eu commission to  urgently  step up its monitoring of malta.  we think there are serious questions regarding the freedom of media and the lack of law enforcement in malta,  said daniel koster, an epp spokesman. he said the epp had doubts about what the commission was doing to address this situation. the calls from the conservatives were echoed by the liberal, leftist and green groupings in the assembly. reports from the maltese anti money laundering agency were leaked in june via caruana galizia s blog. they raised concerns about pilatus bank, a maltese lender accused of having failed to report suspicious dealings as required by law. the eu lawmakers  draft resolution calls on malta to investigate pilatus bank. the bank and the maltese police did not reply to reuters  questions on the allegations.  there appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach,  of money laundering rules in malta, an eu commission official told reuters in reply to questions over the island s application of eu rules on money laundering. the draft resolution, citing findings of the parliament s inquiry committee on money laundering, said maltese institutions in charge of enforcing rules to prevent financial crimes were  highly politicized .  the number of convictions and confiscations related to money laundering in malta seems extremely low,  it said.

" the powerful exiled son of yemen s slain ex president ali abdullah saleh vowed on tuesday to lead a campaign against the houthi movement that killed his father after he switched sides in the civil war. the intervention by ahmed ali saleh, a former leader of the elite republican guard once seen as a likely successor to his father, gives the anti houthi movement in sanaa a potential figurehead, after a week of fighting that saw the houthis rout saleh s supporters in the capital. yemen s war, pitting the iran allied houthis who control sanaa against a saudi led military alliance backing a government based in the south, has brought what the united nations calls the world s worst humanitarian crisis. the world body says millions of people may die in one of the worst famines of modern times, caused by warring parties blocking food supplies. saleh had helped the houthis win control of much of the country s north including sanaa, and his decision to switch allegiances and abandon the houthis in the past week was the most dramatic change on the battlefield in years. but the houthis swiftly crushed a pro saleh uprising in the capital and shot him dead in an attack on his convoy. tens of thousands of houthi supporters staged a rally in the capital on tuesday to show support for their leader and celebrate the death of saleh. they chanted slogans against saudi arabia and its allies.  mahmoud ali al houthi, head of the movement s revolutionary committee, denied allegations that the group was executing members of saleh s party after their capture:  we have been treating some of saleh s sons and we haven t executed them,  he told the crowd.  sanaa saw no fresh fighting on tuesday after five days of combat that the red cross said killed more than 230 people. the saudi led coalition struck the city with 25 air strikes overnight, but u.n. and red cross aid flights were able to land at the airport, u.n. humanitarian coordinator in yemen jamie mcgoldrick said.  people are now emerging from their houses after five days being locked down basically as prisoners,  mcgoldrick told a u.n. briefing by phone from sanaa.  they are now seeking safety, moving their families in case things erupt again and at the same time seeking medical treatment and trying to pacify very terrified kids who have endured five days of relentless shelling, shooting and ground fire and air strikes.  the saudi cabinet, in a statement that did not mention saleh by name, said it hoped the sanaa uprising against the houthis would  help rid sisterly yemen of repression, death threats, ... explosions and seizure of private and public property . the death of saleh, who once compared ruling yemen to dancing on the heads of snakes, deepens the complexity of the multi sided war. much is likely to depend on the future allegiances of his loyalists, who had previously helped the armed houthi group, which hails from the zaidi branch of shi ite islam that ruled a thousand year kingdom in northern yemen until 1962. in a statement sent to reuters by an aide, his son said his father was killed at  the hands of the enemies of god and the country . ahmed ali said he would  confront the enemies of the homeland and humanity, who are trying to obliterate its identity and its gains and to humiliate yemen and yemenis . in an earlier statement carried by saudi state media, ahmed ali said he would lead  the battle until the last houthi is thrown out of yemen ... the blood of my father will be hell ringing in the ears of iran.  the arabian peninsula s poorest country, yemen is one of the most violent fronts in a proxy war between saudi arabia and iran, who have also backed opposing sides in syria, iraq and elsewhere across the middle east.  the saudi led coalition appears to have been counting on saleh s decision to switch sides to tip the balance of the war. saleh, who ruled in sanaa from 1978 2012, had a strong following in yemen, including army officers and armed tribal leaders who once served under him. during the years the ex president was allied to the houthis, yemeni political sources say ahmed ali was living incommunicado under house arrest at a guarded villa in the uae capital abu dhabi, where he had served as ambassador. the uae is a key member of the mostly gulf arab alliance that sees the houthis as a proxy of their arch enemy iran. the gulf countries had struggled to make gains against the houthi saleh alliance despite thousands of air strikes backed by western arms and intelligence. they have used their air and sea power to tightly restrict imports, action that the united nations says could lead to mass hunger. ahmed ali may be the family s last chance to win back influence. a nephew of the former leader, tareq mohammed abdullah saleh, a senior military commander, was also killed during clashes with the houthis, saleh s party said on tuesday. residents reported that fighting had subsided but that  saudi led coalition jets pounded several targets, including the downtown presidential palace where a governing body led by houthi saleh politicians had regularly convened. the houthi leader, abdul malek al houthi, hailed saleh s death in a speech on monday as a victory against a treasonous conspiracy by yemen s saudi enemies and called for tuesday s mass rally at a parade ground near the site of the air strikes. in the southern city of aden, where the saudi backed government is based, residents set off fireworks and expressed joy. saleh was hated throughout southern yemen after he launched a war to unify the country in 1994, lobbing ballistic missiles at the city. but his legacy is mixed. he is still loved in much of the north and many supporters will bear a grudge towards his killers. some feared saleh s death would only create more instability in yemen.  we expect things will get worse for us. this will be the beginning of a new conflict and more bloodshed. the war will not end soon,  said aswan abdu khalid, an academic at the psychology department at the university of aden.

" malaysia s ruling party united behind scandal tainted prime minister najib razak as he prepares for a general election due by august by deciding on friday that he could stand unopposed in a party leadership contest due some time next year. najib is hoping to win a third term despite the multi billion dollar corruption scandal at 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb) that has dogged his premiership for the last two years. najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing at the state fund, which he founded and served as chairman of the advisory board. at its last annual party conference before a general election, the united malays national organisation (umno) gave both najib and his deputy, ahmad zahid hamidi, a free pass to retain their posts in a party leadership ballot next year.  therefore, in the spirit of togetherness and mutuality...  state run news agency bernama quoted permanent chairman badruddin amiruldin as saying,  it is decided at this assembly that the post of president held by datuk seri najib razak and the post of deputy president datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi, will not be contested in the coming elections.  when the 1mdb controversy first erupted in 2015, najib quashed an internal revolt after some umno leaders asked him to step down and he blocked an inquiry into the affair. leadership elections were postponed as he went on to purge the party of dissent while he also dropped his former liberal image, cracking down on opponents and civil society, as he moved umno closer to conservative islamist values, worrying malaysia s sizable chinese and indian minorities. addressing the conference earlier this week, najib called for loyalty from umno s 3.4 million members.  have absolute loyalty and obey all the instructions of the top leadership,  he said in a keynote address to the party faithful. four years ago, umno crept back into power despite registering its worst ever election performance, as an opposition front led the charismatic anwar ibrahim called foul after losing despite winning the popular vote. this time, however, the challenge is coming from the veteran  mahathir mohamad   who gave up the premiership in 2003 after 22 years in power and had been najib s political mentor. mahathir, has come out of retirement to team up with anwar   who is languishing in jail having been convicted in a case that both he and independent observers say was politically motivated. a rebounding economy and strengthening ringgit currency have helped najib improve his image among malaysians, who have been frustrated with the corruption and rising living costs. but the 1mdb scandal refuses to go away, with u.s. attorney general this week referring to the case as the worst example of kleptocracy that the department of justice had investigated.

" the u.s. congress moved rapidly on thursday to send president donald trump a short term funding bill to avert a government shutdown this weekend, leaving fights over budget priorities and a range of other controversial issues for the coming weeks. the house of representatives, working against a friday midnight deadline, approved legislation in a 235 193 vote to fund a wide range of federal programs through dec. 22.  the senate followed up by approving the bill 81 14. the white house has said trump will sign it into law. the measure creates more time for a reckoning between republicans and democrats about budget differences, which trump discussed in a meeting with leading lawmakers at the white house earlier in the day. “we hope that we’re going to make some great progress for our country. i think that will happen,” trump said. the white house said negotiations would resume on friday. leaders now have about two weeks to find common ground on a host of thorny issues for the next government funding bill in order to prevent a partial government shutdown on dec. 23. both sides want to avoid having parts of the government close, particularly during the holidays, for fear of a public backlash, and leaders from both parties have preemptively blamed the other for such a potential outcome.  that political blame game is likely to continue in the next two weeks while, behind the scenes, leaders hammer out a compromise.   republicans mainly want a big increase in defense spending for the fiscal year ending sept. 30, 2018. but democrats are insisting that any added pentagon funding be accompanied by increases to other domestic programs. democrats also want to enact into law protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought into the united states.  republicans want a much wider series of immigration law changes to further clamp down on foreign arrivals, and they want immigration negotiations to be held on a separate track from the government funding bill. democrats also want to shore up the affordable care act, known as “obamacare,” by reviving federal subsidies for low income people in the program. house democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer joined trump and republican congressional leaders for the talks after canceling a similarly planned meeting last week when the president posted a note on twitter attacking their policy positions. the two democrats said in a statement that the meeting on thursday was productive but nothing specific had been agreed. defense secretary jim mattis joined the group to discuss military matters. the white house foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non defense spending, white house legislative affairs director marc short told reuters.  he said the white house wants a deal that covers spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   earlier on thursday, schumer said trump seemed to be rooting for a shutdown and warned that, if one occurs, “it will fall on his shoulders.”  “his party controls the senate, the house and the presidency,” he said. “nobody here wants to see a shutdown. we democrats are not interested in one.” pelosi said democrats were not willing to shut down the government over the deferred action for child arrivals (daca) immigration program, but she also said “we will not leave here without a daca fix.” ",0

" billionaire investor wilbur ross was sworn in as u.s. commerce secretary on tuesday after helping shape republican president donald trump’s opposition to multilateral trade deals. vice president mike pence administered the oath of office to ross, 79, a day after the u.s. senate voted to confirm the corporate turnaround expert’s nomination, with strong support from democrats. after the swearing in, ross welcomed the democratic support and said the vote suggested that “perhaps, finally building america up again may become a bipartisan thing.” ross is set to become an influential voice in trump’s economic team and was expected to start work on renegotiating trade relationships with china and mexico. while commerce secretaries rarely take the spotlight in washington, ross is expected to play an outsize role in pursuing trump’s campaign pledge to slash u.s. trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to america. some democrats criticized ross as another billionaire in a trump cabinet that says it is focused on the working class and for being a “vulture” investor who has eliminated some jobs. reuters reported last month that ross’s companies had shipped some 2,700 jobs overseas since 2004.

" qatar is  open to dialogue  in resolving a dispute that has seen the gulf state isolated from its arab neighbors, its emir said during a visit to indonesia on wednesday. saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade ties with qatar on june 5, accusing it of financing terrorism and maintaining too close of ties to their arch rival iran. doha denies the charges. qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani said he discussed the issue with president joko widodo of indonesia, which has the world s largest population of muslims and has close ties to the arab world.          we conveyed...that qatar is ready to conduct a dialogue to solve the problem as we already know that no one will win,  thani told reporters after meeting with widodo at the state palace in bogor, outside the capital of jakarta.  we are all brothers and suffering because of this crisis,  he added. president widodo did not publicly address the dispute. the leader of the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas also visited malaysia   another muslim majority nation   and singapore this week.     saudi and other arab nations have made a list of 13 wide ranging demands of qatar, including closing down the al jazeera television network and curbing ties with iran.  kuwait and top united states officials have attempted to mediate between the parties, but there is little sign that the crisis will be resolved soon.

" hillary clinton came closer than any other woman to winning the white house on tuesday but fell short for a second time, a bitter disappointment for a pioneering but polarizing american political figure. seeking to win election to the office her husband bill clinton held from 1993 to 2001, clinton, 69, lost her battle for the democratic presidential nomination to barack obama in 2008 and lost on tuesday to republican donald trump, 70. trump told supporters at a rally early on wednesday that clinton had phoned to congratulate him on his victory. a clinton campaign aide confirmed the phone call. in 2000, clinton became the only first lady to win elected office, as a u.s. senator from new york. in 2009, she became the third female secretary of state. in july, she became the first woman to claim a major u.s. party’s presidential nomination.  the presidency turned out to be a bridge too far. accepting her party’s nomination in july, she embraced the historic nature of her candidacy, saying that “when any barrier falls in america it clears the way for everyone. after all, when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit. so let’s keep going. let’s keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves to have.”     during four decades in public life, clinton withstood such controversies as an fbi investigation of her use of a private email server as secretary of state, probes into past business dealings, her husband’s infidelity and an unsuccessful republican effort to remove him from office. two american women, geraldine ferraro in 1984 and sarah palin in 2008, were nominated by major parties as their vice presidential nominees, but fell short in the general election. after losing to obama in the 2008 race, clinton deferred her white house ambitions, and served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. clinton’s admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. campaigning for her on monday in michigan, obama called clinton “a candidate who is smart, a candidate who’s steady, a candidate who’s tested   probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office.” her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power hungry opportunist. she was detested by many republicans and conservatives, and in 1998 during her husband’s presidency bemoaned a “vast right wing conspiracy.” against trump, she portrayed herself as guarding the country from the threat she said he posed to american democracy. “as i’ve told people, i’m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse,” clinton told the new york times in october. when she entered the race last year for the democratic presidential nomination, she was considered such a prohibitive favorite that others in her party shied away from challenging her. but she was an establishment figure and a washington insider at a time when voters were smitten with outsiders. she secured the democratic nomination in july only after beating back a surprisingly stout challenge from u.s. senator bernie sanders, who appealed to young voters and mustered the kind of excitement that clinton sometimes failed to generate. as secretary of state, she dealt with civil wars in syria and libya, iran’s nuclear program, china’s growing clout, russian assertiveness, ending the iraq war, winding down the afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the israeli palestinian conflict. congressional republicans spent years investigating allegations of state department security lapses related to a 2012 attack by militants in the libyan city of benghazi that killed the u.s. ambassador. she testified during marathon congressional hearings in january 2013 at the end of her tenure at the state department and in october 2015, while already a candidate for president, facing republican criticism of her handling of the incident. another politically damaging issue came to light during the lengthy congressional investigation into the benghazi attack: accusations that she broke the law in her handling of classified information while corresponding through the private email server for her government work as secretary of state. the u.s. justice department in july accepted fbi director james comey’s recommendation not to bring criminal charges against her, although he faulted her “extremely careless”  handling of classified information. comey announced 11 days before the election that the fbi was investigating a new collection of emails as part of its probe, but said two days before the election that a review of those emails produced nothing that would change the decision not to bring charges. trump called her “crooked hillary,” said he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraged his supporters to chant “lock her up.” clinton called trump as a racist hate monger, a sexist and a tax dodger enamored with russian president vladimir putin. she defended her lengthy service in government, dismissing trump’s contention that she had produced no real accomplishments. born in chicago on oct. 26, 1947, hillary rodham clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small business owner father she called a “rock ribbed, up by your bootstraps, conservative republican” and a mother who was a closet democrat. she attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all female wellesley college in massachusetts, where she headed the young republicans club. her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and vietnam war escalation and she switched parties. at yale law school, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from arkansas, bill clinton, and they became a couple. she moved to washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the watergate scandal. she moved to arkansas to be with bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. he jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. she gave birth to the couple’s only child, daughter chelsea, in 1980. as arkansas’ first lady, she was a high powered lawyer in the capital little rock and a wal mart corporate board member. most americans were introduced to her during her husband’s bid for the 1992 democratic presidential nomination. bill clinton said voters would get “two for the price of one” if they elected him. she unapologetically said she was not a woman who “stayed home and baked cookies.” after a woman named gennifer flowers accused bill clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, hillary clinton appeared on tv with her husband and referred to singer tammy wynette’s song, “stand by your man.” “you know, i’m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette,” she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. “and you know, if that’s not enough for people, then heck, don’t vote for him,” she added.  conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. bill clinton defeated incumbent republican president george h.w. bush in november 1992. as first lady from 1993 to 2001, unlike many of her predecessors, she was an active part of policymaking. critics assailed her unsuccessful effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as “hillarycare.” she and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. a real estate venture known as whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed bill clinton’s sexual relationship with a white house intern named monica lewinsky. deputy white house counsel vince foster, a figure in the whitewater controversy and a close friend of the clintons from arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. his death was ruled a suicide. in a 2003 memoir, hillary clinton blasted “conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that vince was murdered to cover up what he ‘knew about whitewater.’”  in 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to whitewater. in december 1998, the republican led house of representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in u.s. history, charging bill clinton with “high crimes and misdemeanors” for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with lewinsky. the republican led senate acquitted clinton in february 1999. hillary clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by republicans with a “soviet style show trial” and condemned what she called “an attempted congressional coup d’etat.” she also said she “wanted to wring bill’s neck” for the affair and upbraided him privately. ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling. she launched her own bid for elected office and won election in 2000 as a u.s. senator. the 2008 race for the democratic presidential nomination pitted america’s foremost woman politician against the son of a black kenyan father and a white kansan mother. after vanquishing clinton, obama made history when he defeated republican john mccain to become the first black u.s. president.

" papua new guinea began dismantling a shuttered australian run immigration detention center on thursday and warned it will use force if necessary to evict nearly 600 men if they refuse to leave within two days, according to a notice posted at the camp. the asylum seekers have barricaded themselves inside the  manus island center for the past nine days, defying attempts by australia and papua new guinea to close the camp in a standoff the united nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . the men fear violent reprisals from the manus island community if they move from the camp to three transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the united states. the camp was closed on oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off.  you may become very sick under these conditions of overflowing sewerage, heaps of rubbish, no clean running water, no electricity and no food,  papua new guinea s immigration and citizenship service authority said in a two page notice reviewed by reuters.  you are therefore instructed to vacate this compound immediately...if necessary, force may be used to relocate those who refuse to move voluntarily for your own sake.  the men inside the camp, who include asylum seekers from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka, and syria, said they will continue to defy attempts to shut the camp. they said they had exhausted their food supplies and were relying on rainwater to drink. several of the men told reuters that nearly 100 of them had fallen sick. the notice added that demolition of fences would begin on thursday. behrouz boochani, a kurdish journalist from iran who has been detained on manus island for more than four years, said on twitter that workers had begun that task.  the refugees are watching them fearfully...(they) are extremely scared by immigration threat but still saying we will not leave this prison camp for another prison camp,  he said.  using force against ppl who ve been suffering nearly 5yrs is no solution. if you re going to solve this problem send us to safe third country.  australia has used the manus island center, and another on the tiny pacific island of nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. it says boat arrivals will never enter australia, even if they are found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in asia. papua new guinea s high court ruled last year that the manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal and the camp closed on oct. 31, when australian funded security staff withdrew. thursday s png government notice said the camp will soon revert to the control of the nation s military and anyone there unlawfully will be liable for arrest. papua new guinea prime minister peter o neill on wednesday said  appropriate means  would be used to apprehend those responsible for  disruption . australia s immigration minister peter dutton said on thursday that the situation was  unacceptable...but the government won t be backing down . the png supreme court rejected an application by one of the men to restore services on tuesday, despite pleas from the united nations to make food, water, medical supplies and power available. lawyers for the asylum seekers are due to lodge an appeal against later on thursday.

" israel s attorney general is considering indicting the wife of prime minister benjamin netanyahu, sara, on suspicion of using state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000, the justice ministry said on friday. the ministry statement said the attorney general was considering prosecuting sara netanyahu for offences that include fraudulently procuring items, fraud and breach of trust. a post on the prime minister s facebook page published late on thursday in response to media reports about a forthcoming announcement by attorney general avichai mandelblit, said the claims against sara netanyahu were  absurd and will be proven to be unfounded . it was unclear what political impact friday s announcement might have on netanyahu, who himself is under investigation in two corruption cases.  one of those, known as case 1000, involves gifts that the prime minister and his family may have received from businessmen, while case 2000 deals with alleged efforts by him to secure better coverage from an israeli newspaper publisher. netanyahu   who has been prime minister for 11 years over four terms   has denied any wrongdoing.  netanyahu leads a relatively stable coalition government and presides over a buoyant economy. his conservative likud party has rallied behind him in the absence of clear rivals for the leadership, rebuffing calls for his departure from the center left opposition. likud s religious nationalist coalition partners, seeing no threat to their agenda with netanyahu as prime minister, are likewise sticking with him for now. in a case dubbed  the meals ordering affair  by the justice ministry, sara netanyahu with help from an aide allegedly created a false impression between 2010 2013 that no cooks were employed at the prime minister s official residence, while indeed there were, according to the ministry statement. this was done, the statement said, to procure state funding for outside catering that would have been covered had there been no chef.  in this way, hundreds of meals from restaurants and chefs worth 359,000 shekels ($102,399) were received from the state fraudulently,  said the justice ministry statement. sara netanyahu has the option to plead her case in a hearing with the attorney general.

" long viewed by the republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, u.s. senator marco rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks donald trump and ted cruz. regarded as well spoken and telegenic, rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in iowa and new hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until iowa’s feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first term florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire trump and u.s. senator cruz of texas. his prospects reach a critical moment at a thursday night debate in south carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to trump and cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former florida governor jeb bush and governors chris christie of new jersey and john kasich of ohio. republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment republicans as well as anti establishment conservatives who favor cruz. the debate, on the fox business network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. et on thursday (0200 gmt on friday). the son of cuban immigrants, rubio has drawn support by stressing his working class upbringing in las vegas and miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. but voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face to face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either iowa or new hampshire, which has a feb. 9 primary. rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. “i feel good but we’ve got to close strong,” said rubio’s new hampshire state director, jim merrill. a reuters/ipsos opinion poll showed rubio on wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among republicans after trump, cruz, bush and retired neurosurgeon ben carson. some voters have cited a tendency by rubio in past months to stick to well honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town hall meetings where people can ask questions. this has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. “there’s a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in iowa it just seems like he hasn’t fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that’s causing some pause,” iowa republican strategist doug gross said. dennis thorell of new durham, new hampshire, said rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than u.s. senator and former speaker of the florida house of representatives. thorell said rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a republican administration. “he hasn’t had any experience running anything,” thorell said while listening to rubio in concord, new hampshire, last week. “he did very well in the legislature down in florida and was mentored by jeb (bush) but he hasn’t run anything.” rival candidates for the republican nomination have assailed rubio also for his absences from the u.s. senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. defending his record of missed votes, rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. rubio aides told reuters they plan a multimillion dollar advertising campaign for new hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the tv airwaves in the state. the aides said rubio has plans to be a major presence in both iowa and new hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give and take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. they said rubio’s schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind the scenes fund raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. republican strategists say rubio’s path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third place finish in iowa presumably behind poll leaders cruz and trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into new hampshire. if rubio goes on to place high in iowa and do well in new hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. “from the get go we said we didn’t want to peak in september, we wanted to peak in february. it’s starting to grow. it feels like it’s starting to happen for us,” rubio spokesman alex conant said. republican analysts say rubio appears to be as well placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment republican favorite. he is drawing increasingly larger crowds in new hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. “i think he suffered from the perception that he hasn’t been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,” republican strategist steve duprey said. “if he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.” for more on the 2016 presidential race, see the reuters blog, “tales from the trail” (here).

" in a heist reminiscent of a hollywood movie, kenyan robbers spent months tunneling into the bowels of a bank located opposite a police station and stole the equivalent of half a million dollars, police said on tuesday. police said they had arrested two men and one woman over the robbery but had not recovered the 50 million kenyan shillings, reported missing by staff at the branch of kenya commercial bank (kcb) on monday when they showed up to work.  we have not recovered the stolen money,  said simba willy, sub county police commander in the town of thika, northeast of nairobi, where the heist took place.  we suspect the robbers hired one of the shops near the bank (while digging their tunnel),  willy told reuters. the robbers were able to remove the earth during their months long excavations without arousing suspicion by concealing it in boxes, the daily nation newspaper quoted local traders as saying. the traders described the two young men who had rented the store as  very hardworking  and  introverts . kcb, which is the region s biggest bank by assets, confirmed the break in on twitter.  but the kenyans have competition for the title of most ingenious robbery. last month brazilian police foiled a plot to rob a sao paulo bank after discovering a 500 metre underground tunnel kitted out with lighting and ventilation systems.

" california governor jerry brown urged continued fiscal restraint amid the state’s economic expansion but hinted broadly that new fees would be needed to pay for repairs of deteriorating roads, bridges and other infrastructure. improvements in the state’s financial health and a weather pattern that is helping to ease four years of catastrophic drought put california on a stronger footing as brown addressed the legislature for his 14th state of the state address on thursday. “we have to bite the bullet,” said brown, who last summer pushed unsuccessfully for new fees to help pay long neglected repairs to the state’s transportation infrastructure. roads and bridges make up the bulk of an estimated $77 billion in delayed repairs to public property, he said, and, “one way or another the roads must be fixed.” brown, who served two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983 before returning to california’s top job in 2011, also called on republicans to agree to proposed changes in a tax on some health insurers, with proceeds to help pay for healthcare for the poorest californians. brown cited his administration’s support for california’s new $10 minimum wage, saying the january hike, combined with a tax credit for the working poor, will ease income inequality. brown has been tight fisted since returning to office in 2011, reining in the state’s liberal democratic majority lawmakers to build a rainy day fund and hold down expenses after facing down a $27 billion budget deficit. he is widely credited with stabilizing the state’s finances, in large part by urging voters in 2012 to approve a temporary tax increase that allowed the state to cover its budget gap and restore some social services. earlier this month, brown proposed a budget plan for fiscal year 2016 2017 that included a $2 billion payment to the state’s rainy day fund and called for increases in spending on education, transportation infrastructure, as well as a modest increase in aid for the disabled. but the fiscal moderate has held the line on committing more funds to such programs in the absence of new revenue streams for the state. he is hesitant to call for new taxes on income or sales after supporting a temporary tax three years ago, but has supported other fees, such as a road usage tax or an increase in the tax on gasoline. senate republican leader jean fuller of bakersfield said her caucus would work with brown on infrastructure repairs, but opposes enacting new fees.

" rupert murdoch s british newspaper group said on friday one of its titles had hacked the computer of a former intelligence officer, an admission which critics said showed why his takeover of european broadcaster sky should be blocked. in a hearing at london s high court, murdoch s news group newspapers admitted  vicarious liability  for the hacking of computers belonging to ian hurst, who worked for british military intelligence. the case comes a month after britain s media minister said regulators should scrutinize murdoch s planned $15 billion takeover of sky over concerns about broadcasting standards and its impact on media plurality. hurst s lawyer jeremy reed said in a court statement the irish edition of the news of the world newspaper had hired a private investigator to intercept his client s emails in 2006.  hurst had served in northern ireland and later wrote a book about his experiences, including details of britain s top spy in the irish republican army (ira), alfredo scappaticci, known by the codename  stakeknife .  reed said it was likely he was targeted because an employee of the newspaper wanted to trace scappaticci.  i confirm that news group newspapers ... accepts vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of computer interception,  said anthony hudson, the lawyer for the newspaper group, adding it had paid  substantial  damages to hurst and his family.  news group newspapers accepts that such activity happened, accepts that it should never have happened, and has undertaken to the court that it will never happen again.  opponents of murdoch s takeover said the case was evidence the deal should not be allowed to go through and they would send a dossier to the competition & markets authority (cma) which is examining the proposed deal.  it s vital that the cma is able to take this new evidence of criminality and corporate failure into account as it assesses the murdochs  bid to take over sky,  said tom watson, deputy leader of britain s opposition labour party.      murdoch shut the news of the world in 2011 after its journalists were found to have been involved in widespread phone hacking.    his original attempt to buy full control of sky was ditched in the wake of the scandal. since then the company has been split in two, separating the newspapers from entertainment assets to help to smooth the deal s passage. last month murdoch s son james said he was confident regulators would assess the deal on its merits and not be swayed by those with grievances against his father s newspapers, saying the company had dealt effectively with past problems.

" the united states on thursday said it welcomed an announcement by a saudi led coalition to keep the hodeidah port in yemen open for a month and allow humanitarian aid to flow through, and condemned a houthi bombing of a palace in saudi arabia. in a brief statement, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders suggested the united states believed iran bore ultimate responsibility for the dec. 19 missile attack against the palace in riyadh.  we urge the united nations security council to hold iran responsible for its repeated and blatant violations of security council resolutions,  sanders said. at a briefing later on thursday, deputy assistant secretary of state tim lenderking said the united states would have a conversation with saudi arabia about the 30 days the port will be open and about possibly changing the timeline, but said the united states first wants to see ships moving in and goods and services reaching the people of yemen. the saudi led arab coalition fighting in yemen said on wednesday it would open the houthi controlled port it had blockaded. a cholera epidemic has been spreading across the country and 8 million people are on the brink of famine in what the united nations deems the world s worst humanitarian crisis. the saudis say the red sea port is also a hub used by the houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses iran of supplying. tehran denies the charges. lenderking also said there was no military solution to the conflict and that president donald trump s administration believes the best course is  aggressive diplomacy.  trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted on thursday in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital. when asked if u.s. aid to yemen would diminish given that yemen drafted the resolution and was one of the 120 countries that voted for it, lenderking said he was not sure but trump s threat was not empty.

" russia reserves the right to cut further the number of u.s. diplomatic staff in moscow, russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday, in response to what he called washington s  boorish  treatment of russia s diplomatic mission on u.s. soil. speaking after u.s. officials ordered russia to vacate diplomatic premises in several american cities, putin said he would order the russian foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of russia s property rights.  that the americans reduced the number of our diplomatic facilities   this is their right,  putin told a news conference in the chinese city of xiamen, where he was attending a summit of major emerging economies.  the only thing is that it was done in such a clearly boorish manner. that does not reflect well on our american partners. but it s difficult to conduct a dialogue with people who confuse austria and australia. nothing can be done about it. probably such is the level of political culture of a certain part of the u.s. establishment.   as for our buildings and facilities, this is an unprecedented thing,  putin said.  this is a clear violation of russia s property rights. therefore, for a start, i will order the foreign ministry to go to court   and let s see just how efficient the much praised u.s. judiciary is.  a u.s. state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said washington hoped to avoid further retaliatory actions with moscow, but was   confident in the legality  of the consular closure and restrictions ordered last week. u.s. president donald trump took office in january, saying he wanted to improve ties with russia. putin also spoke favorably of trump. but relations have been damaged by accusations from u.s. intelligence officials that russia sought to meddle in the presidential election. russia has denied interfering in the vote. asked by a reporter if he was disappointed with trump, putin said:  whether i am disappointed or not, your question sounds very naive   he is not my bride and, likewise, i am neither his bride nor bridegroom.   we are both statesmen. every nation has interests of its own. in his activities, trump is guided by the national interests of his country, and i by the interests of mine.   i greatly hope that we will be able, just as the current u.s. president said, to find some compromises while resolving bilateral and international problems ... taking into account our joint responsibility for international security.  the u.s. order for russia to vacate some of its diplomatic  properties was the latest in a series of tit for tat actions that began when former u.s. president barack obama, late last year, expelled 35 russian diplomats. the obama administration said it was retaliating for russian meddling in the u.s. presidential election. in july, moscow responded, ordering the united states to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in russia by around 60 percent, to 455. moscow said the move aimed to bring the number of u.s. and russian diplomats working on each other s soil to parity. but putin said the latest expulsions ordered by washington brought the number of russian diplomats on u.s. soil to below parity.  he said the united states was erroneously counting 155 russian diplomats working at the united nations headquarters in new york as being russian diplomats on u.s. soil. if they are removed from the equation, putin said, russia has fewer than 455 diplomats in the united states.  we reserve the right to take a decision on the number of u.s. diplomats in moscow. but we won t do that for now. let s wait and see how the situation develops further,  he said. the united states has ordered the closure of the russian consulate in san francisco and two buildings housing trade missions in washington and new york.  u.s. russian relations have also been badly strained by moscow s annexation of crimea in 2014 and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern ukraine, developments which led washington to impose economic sanctions on russia. trump, himself battling allegations that his associates colluded with russia, grudgingly signed into law the new sanctions against moscow that had been drawn up by congress.

" the united states on wednesday abstained for the first time from a united nations general assembly vote on a resolution calling for an end to a u.s. economic embargo on cuba, after opposing such measures every year for 24 years. for the 25th time, the 193 member general assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor. israel, which opposed the resolution last year, also abstained on wednesday. such resolutions are non binding, but can carry political weight. communist run cuba and the united states, former cold war foes, began normalizing relations in 2014. u.s. president barack obama has taken steps to ease trade and travel restrictions on cuba, but only the u.s. congress can lift the full embargo. the republican controlled congress has resisted obama’s call to lift washington’s economic embargo after more than 50 years. republican critics say obama is making too many concessions to cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights. the u.n. general assembly applauded when u.s. ambassador to the united nations samantha power announced prior to the vote that the united states would abstain. “abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the united states agrees with all of the policies and practices of the cuban government. we do not,” power told the general assembly.  “we are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,” she said. cuba’s foreign minister bruno rodriguez described the abstention as a “positive step for the future of improving relations between the united states and cuba.” rodriguez said in september that damage from u.s. sanctions between april 2015 and march 2016 amounted to $4.6 billion and to $125.9 billion since the embargo’s inception more than 50 years ago. in march, obama made the first visit to havana by a u.s. president in 88 years. his trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after cuba’s 1959 revolution. since the opening, obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing cuba to accelerate market style reforms and boost political and economic freedoms. the u.n. resolution adopted on wednesday takes note of the steps taken by obama as positive but “still limited in scope.” it urges the united states to repeal or invalidate the embargo on cuba as soon as possible.

" democratic presidential contender bernie sanders easily won nominating contests in alaska, washington and hawaii on saturday, chipping away at front runner hillary clinton’s commanding lead in the race to pick the party’s candidate for the white house. sanders still faces a steep climb to overtake clinton but the big victories in the west generated more momentum for his upstart campaign and could stave off calls from democratic leaders that he should wrap up his bid in the name of party unity. sanders appeared headed to victory margins of more than 50 percentage points in both alaska and washington, and led by about 40 points in hawaii with some 90 percent of the results tallied there. “we are making significant inroads in secretary clinton’s lead and ... we have a path to victory,” sanders told cheering, chanting supporters in madison, wisconsin. “it is hard for anybody to deny that our campaign has the momentum.” clinton, the former secretary of state, has increasingly turned her attention toward a potential nov. 8 general election showdown against republican front runner donald trump, claiming she is on the path to wrapping up the nomination. heading into saturday, she led sanders by about 300 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,382 delegates needed to be nominated at the party’s july convention in philadelphia. adding in the support of superdelegates   party leaders who are free to back any candidate   she has 1,690 delegates to 946 for sanders. sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, needs to win up to two thirds of the remaining delegates to catch clinton, who will keep piling up delegates even when she loses under a democratic party system that awards them proportionally in all states. “these wins will help him raise more funds for the next few weeks but i don’t think it changes the overall equation,” said democratic strategist jim manley, a clinton supporter. “hillary clinton has too big a lead.” but sanders has repeatedly said he is staying in the race until the convention, pointing to big crowds at his rallies and high turnout among young and first time voters as proof of his viability. after raising $140 million, he has the money to fight on as long as he wants. he has energized the party’s liberal base and young voters with his calls to rein in wall street and fight income inequality, a message that resonated in liberal washington and other western states. sanders won in utah and idaho this week. “don’t let anybody tell you we can’t win the nomination or the general election,” sanders told supporters in wisconsin, which holds the next contest on april 5. “we are going to do both.” all three contests on saturday were caucuses, a format that has favored sanders because it requires more commitment from voters. they also were in states with fewer of the black and hispanic voters who have helped fuel clinton’s lead. “he was just more aligned with my values. i am young and i never knew there could be someone like him in politics,” said samantha burton of seattle, who said sanders was the first candidate who had inspired her to make a donation. jocelyn alt, a birthing assistant at a seattle hospital, said she backed clinton because she believed the times called for someone who could get things done. “she knows how to make things happen,” she said. “i think hillary is more likely to win against a republican.” after wisconsin, the democratic race moves to contests in new york on april 19 and a bloc of five states in the northeast, led by pennsylvania, on april 26. there were no contests on saturday in the republican race featuring trump and rivals u.s. senator ted cruz of texas and ohio governor john kasich. on saturday, the new york times published a lengthy foreign policy focused interview with trump. the new york billionaire told the newspaper he might stop oil purchases from saudi arabia unless they provide troops to fight the islamic state. trump also told the times he was willing to rethink traditional u.s. alliances should he become president.

" a veteran cia clandestine service officer who ran one of the agency’s “black site” prisons set up after the 9/11 attacks was named deputy director of the u.s. spy agency on thursday by u.s. president donald trump.  gina haspel, who will serve under new central intelligence agency director mike pompeo, was the first woman spy to reach the cia’s second highest position, and her selection won applause inside the agency’s virginia headquarters and from many longtime u.s. intelligence professionals. however, haspel once ran a secret cia prison in thailand where two suspected al qaeda members were waterboarded, intelligence and congressional officials said on condition of anonymity. she helped carry out an order to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is considered a form of torture, these people said.  her promotion, combined with the possibility trump could seek to reopen black site prisons and has endorsed waterboarding, may be controversial, despite the fact pompeo and defense secretary james mattis have rejected so called “enhanced interrogation techniques.” a draft executive order requesting a review of whether the u.s. should reopen cia prisons in other countries and revisit other interrogation methods not considered torture has been circulating within the white house, but it is not clear if it will be issued, and if it is, whether any nations would agree to host such facilities again, the officials said. “i appreciate ms. haspel’s many years of service at the cia, yet i want some reassurance from her that she intends to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law, like director pompeo testified that he would during his confirmation process,” said democrat mark warner, vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee. christopher anders, the deputy director of the washington office of the american civil liberties union, said he was “gravely concerned” about haspel’s appointment. haspel has served in a number of overseas posts, including as chief of a major cia station, and although she was briefly acting head of the national clandestine service in 2013, senator dianne feinstein, ranking minority member of the intelligence committee, opposed her permanent promotion to that job. other veteran officials, though, praised pompeo for choosing her. “it speaks well of him for picking a seasoned veteran of the agency who is widely and deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the agency,” said former director of national intelligence james clapper, who resigned on january 20 after 50 years of military and intelligence service.

" pakistani private schools, charitable institutions, and religious seminaries are stepping in to supplement government run schools to help deal with the education needs of a fast growing nation with an estimated 50 million school age children. despite 220,000 schools nationwide, pakistan has over 20 million out of school children, according to a 2016 government report. the government has pumped money into schooling, with the education budget swelling by 15 percent every year since 2010, according to education consultancy alif ailaan. the united nations puts the current budget at 2.65 percent of gdp, roughly $8 billion, or around $150 per student.    but experts say the government can t meet all the education needs and part of the problem lies in quality of teaching rather than just dearth of money.  it s not the number of schools, it s the quality, the attitude,  said zeba hussain, founder of the mashal schools which educate children displaced by war in the country s north. situated on the outskirts of pakistan s capital islamabad, the charitable schools began when hussain met a group of refugee children while visiting the hills encircling the city.  many private institutions criticize what they describe as a deeply flawed government education system.   students are labeled  smart  or  stupid  right from the start,  said shaista kazmi from vision 21, a privately funded ngo that runs speed literacy programs for out of school children that compress five years of reading proficiency into one.  federal education director tariq masood strongly disagreed with critiques of teachers, adding that population growth and funding were the biggest challenges faced by government schools.   no one who is underqualified can enter the government system, there are fewer checks in the private system,  masood said.  masood said government schools adhered to a nationwide curriculum that was being constantly reworked and innovated.  the country s poorest often send their children to one of the thousands of religious madrassas (the arabic word for school) where students are boarded, fed, and given an islamic education. most operate without government oversight.  pakistan s madrassas have become synonmous with creating militant fighters through hardline teachings of islam and many have been linked to organizations such as the taliban and al qaeda.  but many provide shelter, three full meals, and a good education to young people whose families are unable to make ends meet.   in certain cases people send their kids because they can t even afford to feed them,  said irfan sher from the al nadwa madrassa, where all subjects are prioritized and students are capable of analyzing what they are taught.  sher insists that the country s future hinges on what its youth are taught.   the overall policy should be changed ... they should understand that if they want to change the country the only way is to spread quality education,  he said.

" u.s. representative jim jordan, a leading house conservative, said on sunday that fellow conservatives are not discussing replacing speaker paul ryan despite unhappiness with the way republican leaders handled last week’s debt ceiling increase that included no fiscal reforms. many republicans are unhappy with the deal president donald trump reached last week with democratic leaders to raise the government’s debt ceiling and allow it to continue financing federal spending programs until dec. 8. in an interview with fox news sunday, jordan, a republican, appeared to cast blame for the debt ceiling hike on party leaders including ryan, saying they had not provided any “good options” to trump before he struck a deal with democrats. “in this situation, he (trump) wasn’t presented with good options,” said jordan, co founder and former chairman of the house freedom caucus, the most conservative group in the house. “no one is talking about changing the leadership,” jordan told fox. he said a washington post story last week that reported that conservatives had met with ryan to express their dismay about the debt ceiling increase was “hardly news,” because the lawmakers meet with ryan every week. rebellious conservatives pushed out republican john boehner, ryan’s predecessor, as speaker in 2015. the new plan also authorized spending $15.25 billion in emergency disaster relief for the victims of hurricanes harvey and irma. ninety house republicans, including many members of the freedom caucus, voted against the measure, which trump has now signed into law. conservatives have long called for coupling spending reforms with any measures that raise the u.s. debt ceiling. but the deal did the opposite, raising the ceiling and paying for hurricane relief without spending cuts elsewhere. republican leaders had urged an 18 month extension of the debt ceiling, but trump accepted the three month extension  proposed by democrats. jordan said he believed trump has the same vision and focus as the freedom caucus, which was to represent people who felt they had been forgotten by officials in washington. if conservative options are presented to the president, “i’m confident when that happens, he will pick those options that are conservative,” jordan said.

" u.s. president donald trump said on monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across asia that saw governments roll out red carpets “like nobody has ever seen”. “we’ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,” trump told reporters in manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of southeast asian and east asian nations. he did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to japan, south korea, china and vietnam before his last leg in the philippines capital. he said a statement would be issued from the white house on wednesday about north korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful. “it was red carpet like nobody, i think, has probably ever seen,” he said. in vietnam at the weekend, trump and leaders of pacific rim nations agreed to address “unfair trade practices” and “market  distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. his “america first” vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that china now champions. on the sidelines of the vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a trans pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting american jobs. chinese president xi jinping told the summit in vietnam that asia pacific nations must “uphold multilateralism”, countering trump’s message that the united states would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. trump, by contrast, blasted the world trade organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour. some analysts expect tougher u.s. action may be imminent to fight trade imbalances with china exacerbated by its state led economic model.

" americans traveling to cuba later this month are being moved out of havana hotels to make room for president barack obama’s entourage and being sent tantalizingly close to a place u.s. law effectively forbids them from visiting: the beach.  obama will make his historic trip to the communist ruled caribbean island on march 21 22 with hundreds of people in tow, crowning 15 months of warming relations after more than half a century of cold war animosity. cuba is already experiencing a tourism boom and march is traditionally its busiest month. the obama visit has put additional strain on hotels that have already been booked to capacity for much of the high season. major havana hotels are being cleared, according to the head of a u.s. travel company who asked not to be identified for concern it would damage future business relations. “just got notice that the capri, panorama, nacional, half of parque central and potentially other hotels have been told to send all guests to varadero from the 19th to 23rd of march,” he wrote in an e mail. the varadero resort, an hour’s drive east of havana, is cuba’s most sought after tourism destination, with sandy white beaches, shimmering waters and plentiful hotels. but the beach is off limits to americans as u.s. restrictions on travel to the island expressly forbid tourism in cuba. americans are limited to authorized travel such as educational and cultural exchanges. this means most u.s. visitors are concentrated in havana, where there are lots of cultural sites and activities, a rocky seafront and scarce hotel rooms. “the cuban government is clearing out havana hotels and sending visiting u.s. groups to varadero beach for a long weekend,” said collin laverty, president of cuban educational travel, which organizes authorized u.s. travel groups. “tourism will be hard to avoid for a few days as u.s. visitors are surrounded by white sand, turquoise water and all you can eat and drink bars and buffets,” he added. “but we will try.”      cuban travel agencies were not immediately available for comment. following the u.s. cuban detente announced by obama and cuban president raul castro in december 2014, american visits to cuba soared 77 percent in 2015 to 161,000 visitors. cuba is expecting a similar increase this year. obama, a democrat, has loosened travel restrictions to the once forbidden land as well as some other trade barriers. but only congress, currently controlled by republicans, can lift the u.s. embargo and its ban on tourism, in place since the early 1960s.

" u.s. supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg on thursday said she regrets making critical comments about republican presidential contender donald trump. “on reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill advised and i regret making them,” she said in a statement issued by the court. ginsburg, the 83 year old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the u.s. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about trump in a series of media interviews.  her earlier remarks prompted criticism from trump, who said she should resign. in one of a series of twitter posts, he also said ginsburg’s “mind is shot.” the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ginsburg’s statement. legal ethics scholars also questioned ginsburg’s actions, saying supreme court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. the new york times and the washington post chided ginsburg in editorial articles. “judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. in the future i will be more circumspect,” ginsburg said. in a cnn interview posted on tuesday, ginsburg called the presumptive republican nominee “a faker.” in a separate interview with the new york times, ginsburg joked about moving to new zealand if trump wins the white house. under a code of conduct that federal judges   but not supreme court justices   are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.  supreme court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate. the controversy erupted as trump prepared for the opening of the july 18 21 republican convention, which will formally make him the party’s presidential nominee for the nov. 8 election. the supreme court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative justice antonin scalia died in february.

" u.s. house republicans on tuesday insisted they will proceed with a fiscal 2017 budget plan despite a flat out rejection from their party’s fiscal hawks that poses an important test of speaker paul ryan’s leadership.  the $3.9 trillion proposal, which the house budget committee hopes to embrace formally on wednesday for an eventual floor vote, would provide ryan with a first step in his political goal of uniting the republican party behind a detailed policy plan ahead of november’s presidential and congressional elections. the plan aims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade.  “i promise in this speakership that we’re not going to have a top down, cram it down people’s throat kind of leadership,” ryan told reporters.  “we’re going to make decisions as a team. we’re going to push power out to the members, and we’re going to make a team decision on this issue,” he added.    but the house freedom caucus, which includes dozens of outspoken conservatives who dethroned ryan’s predecessor john boehner, has been complaining for months about a $1.07 trillion ceiling for discretionary spending that was enacted into law last november. it says the cap should be $30 billion lower and has warned leaders of its opposition.  several freedom caucus members sit on the house budget panel, including representative dave brat, a virginia republican who described the group’s position as mainstream: “we’re where the american people want us to be.” brat said he was leaning toward voting against the proposal in a committee work session set for wednesday. stubborn opposition among freedom caucus members, despite weeks of behind the scene talks among house republicans, call into question the ability of party leaders to muster the 218 votes needed to pass the budget without help from the chamber’s 188 democrats. representative chris van hollen of maryland, the panel’s top democrat, slammed the republican proposal as a plan that would hurt the middle class and harm the medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled. democratic attacks and fiscal hawk opposition are leading some republicans to call for a seldom used “queen of the hill” strategy that would allow members to consider different proposals but deem the one with the most votes as having passed the chamber. the budget blueprint is non binding, meaning it is not subject to president barack obama’s approval. but it provides guidance to appropriators as they write bills to fund an array of government programs beginning oct. 1, the start of the next fiscal year.

" british foreign secretary boris johnson singled out the muslim brotherhood and its associates for criticism on thursday in a speech calling for a renewed western diplomatic push in the middle east to tackle islamic extremism.  speaking to diplomats and experts at the foreign office in london, johnson called for better engagement with muslim populations worldwide and argued that blaming western intervention for the rise of islamist extremism played into the jihadi narrative. he said the west needed to collectively re insert itself in the process towards peace in syria and called for the united states to bring fresh impetus to the resolution of the israeli palestinian conflict. johnson said the muslim brotherhood   a global islamist organization which started in egypt in 1928   was one of the most politically savvy operators in the muslim world, but he also criticized its conduct in the middle east and britain.  it is plainly wrong that islamists should exploit freedoms here in the uk   freedoms of speech and association   that their associates would repress overseas and it is all too clear that some affiliates of the muslim brotherhood are willing to turn a blind eye to terrorism,  he said. the muslim brotherhood in egypt was designated as a terrorist organization in that country in 2013. a 2015 british government review into the organization concluded that membership of or links to it should be considered a possible indicator of extremism but stopped short of recommending that it should be banned. johnson admitted there had been policy missteps in iraq and syria interventions, but said that did not justify a diplomatic retreat from the region.  british foreign policy is not the problem, it is part of the solution,  he said, calling for a renewed role in syria, more work to halt conflict in yemen and progress in bringing factions together in libya.  we need more engagement, not less,  he said. his remarks come a day after the united states recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, drawing international criticism. british prime minister theresa may has said that decision was wrong, and johnson repeated the government criticism that the u.s. move was premature.  we ... think that the future of jerusalem must be settled as part of the negotiated agreement between israel and the palestinians and as part of the two state solution,  he said.  this decision, having been announced by president trump, the world would like to see some serious announcements by the u.s. about how they see the middle east peace process and how to bring the two sides together.

" chilean conservative presidential candidate sebastian pinera maintained his lead in voter preference ahead of the nov. 19 election, and was seen beating his two closest rivals in a likely runoff, pollster cep said on wednesday. pinera, a wealthy businessman and former president who governed from 2010 to 2014, was seen as stronger on crime and job creation than his seven rivals, in the latest poll. according to the poll, pinera would win 32.8 percent of voters in the first round, up from 31.3 percent in cep s last poll on sept. 1. center left senator alejandro guillier polled 13.8 percent of support, up from 14.5 percent previously, while leftist beatriz sanchez slipped about three percentage points to 7.0 percent. a pinera win would please chile s business community, which blames outgoing president michelle bachelet for sluggish economic growth in the world s top copper exporter.  but it would be considered a letdown for bachelet s center left base and a younger generation of urban chileans, who hope for deeper changes to the country s longstanding, free market economic model. the election is scheduled for nov. 19, but if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, a second round runoff between the top two candidates will be held in december. the poll of 1,424 chileans conducted from sept. 22 to oct. 16 has a margin of error of three percentage points.

" the white house said on tuesday that president donald trump does not agree with a controversial tweet on immigration and birth rates by republican representative steve king. “the president believes that this is not a point of view that he shares. he believes he’s the president for all americans,” white house spokesman sean spicer told a news briefing.  the iowa lawmaker drew condemnation from democrats and fellow republicans after his tweet on sunday praising geert wilders, a nationalist, anti islam politician vying to become the netherlands’ prime minister in a national election on wednesday. “wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” king wrote in a post that drew thousands of “likes.” house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi on tuesday called on house republican leaders to strip king of his chairmanship of the constitution subcommittee for “his latest disgusting and racist statements.”  on monday, she said they “must decide whether white supremacy is welcome in the gop ranks.” a spokeswoman for republican house speaker paul ryan, ashlee strong, said on monday, “the speaker clearly disagrees (with king) and believes america’s long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths.”  king, an early supporter of trump in last year’s presidential election, defended his tweet in an interview on cnn on monday. he pointed to western europe, where he said low birth rates were harming civilization, culture and values. “i’d like to see an america that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same,” he said. “i think there’s far too much focus on race, especially in the last eight years. i want to see that put behind us.” ",0
" a united nations human rights panel called on the russian federation on monday to step up prosecutions of racist attacks by ultra nationalists and neo nazis and of hate speech by politicians. russian authorities must intensify measures to  vigorously combat racist behavior in sports, particularly in football, and ensure that sports regulatory bodies investigate manifestations of racism, xenophobia and intolerance,  the u.n. committee against racial discrimination (cerd) said. fines or administrative sanctions should be imposed for such cases. the panel, referring to  the upcoming (2018) world cup, expresses its concern that racist displays remain deeply entrenched among football fans, especially against persons belonging to ethnic minorities and people of african descent.  russia has pledged to crack down on racism and fan violence as it faces increased scrutiny before hosting the world cup finals next summer. russian premier league champions spartak moscow and rivals dynamo moscow were each fined 250,000 rubles ($4,250) over fans  racist behavior, the russian football union (rfu) said last month. the 18 independent experts, who reviewed russia s record and those of seven other countries at a session that ended on friday, issued their findings on monday. igor barinov, head of the federal agency for ethnic affairs of the russian federation, told the panel on aug. 4 that moscow had taken measures against the propagation of racist ideas.  russia consistently combats the glorification of nazism   made a crime in 2014   the propaganda of nazi ideas and attempts at racial hatred or discrimination, he said. in 2016, officials  had identified 1,450 extremist crimes, 993 had been sent to court and 934 people were found guilty, he said. the u.n. panel said violent racist attacks had decreased in recent years, but added:  violent racist attacks undertaken by groups such as neo nazi groups and cossack patrols, targeting particularly people from central asia and the caucasus and persons belonging to ethnic minorities including migrants, the roma and people of african descent, remain a pressing problem.  it called for an end to  de facto racial profiling by the police , decrying arbitrary identity checks and  unnecessary arrests .  racist hate speech is still used by officials and politicians, especially during election campaigns, and remains unpunished,  it said, recommending investigations. russia still lacks anti discrimination legislation and the definition of extremist activity in its federal law  remains vague and broad , it said. regarding crimea, seized by russia from ukraine in 2014, the panel voiced concern at the fate of crimean tatar representative institutions, such as the outlawing of the mejlis, the crimean tatar s semi official legislature, the closure of several media outlets, and  allegations of disappearances, criminal and administrative prosecutions, mass raids, and interrogations .

" u.s. vice president mike pence heads to europe this week to meet with allies seeking clarity on the trump administration’s foreign policy strategy and its stance toward russia after the resignation of the top white house national security aide.  pence, who has hewn more closely to republican orthodoxy than his boss president donald trump, will attend the munich security conference this weekend and will visit brussels. the trip comes as turmoil swirls within the administration following the resignation of trump’s national security adviser, michael flynn, on monday. flynn, who championed closer ties to russia, stepped down after reports he had discussed u.s. sanctions on moscow with russia’s ambassador. even before flynn’s departure, trump’s calls for warmer ties with moscow and his praise of russian president vladimir putin had unnerved both u.s. lawmakers at home and nato allies. trump has called nato “obsolete” and said member nations were not paying their fair share for u.s. protection.  some european capitals greeted flynn’s departure with relief. flynn was seen by some officials in europe as one of the trump administration’s leading advocates of closer ties to russia and a hardline opponent of the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and western powers. one fear, ahead of a series of important elections in europe, is that a trump white house could actively promote the disintegration of the european union, wolfgang ischinger, chairman of the munich security conference told reporters in berlin. ischinger said he hopes pence states clearly that the breakup of the eu is not the goal of the u.s. government. pence may be unable to lay out many details about trump’s policies given the turbulence on the foreign policy team, but  he could provide insight into white house views ahead of a nato summit in may that trump will attend. “i think from the administration’s point of view, this is an opportunity to make a very major pronouncement on its foreign policy and its european policy,” said alexander vershbow, a former u.s. ambassador to russia and a former deputy secretary general of nato. the white house has not yet previewed pence’s remarks. pence’s comments on russia’s incursions into ukraine will be closely parsed to see whether trump will be willing to trade off u.s. economic sanctions to achieve other security goals, said vershbow, now with the atlantic council. trump’s mixed messages on nato have perplexed european allies. “one minute nato is obsolete   the next minute he loves nato. one minute nato is an impediment and doesn’t do anything for terrorism   the next minute nato is the centerpiece of the global fight,” said retired u.s. navy admiral james stavridis, a former supreme allied commander of nato. pence is the right person to set a more reassuring tone, said stavridis, now dean of the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university. “because of his personality: he’s calm, he’s centered, he’s thoughtful, he’s widely regarded with respect on both sides of the aisle in the united states,” stavridis said in an interview. with flynn’s departure, european officials said they hope pence, defense secretary james mattis and secretary of state rex tillerson become the dominant players in trump’s foreign policy. but this remains an open question. tillerson is also in europe this week, meeting with g20 nations in bonn, and mattis traveled to nato, warning allies that they must honor military spending pledges. u.s. homeland security secretary john kelly will also attend the munich security conference, and while in germany will participate in bilateral meetings with international counterparts, the department of homeland security said in a statement on wednesday.

" for months republican presidential candidates traded insults such as “dummy,” “jerk” and “loser.” then, party front runner donald trump repeated a supporter’s description of ted cruz as a “pussy.” with the contest for the party’s nomination moving into south carolina and the stakes rising, it is possible the most disparaging discourse of the nov. 8 election campaign is yet to come.  the epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. the harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the internet and on cable tv. trump, the billionaire former reality tv star, sent a new hampshire rally into a frenzy on monday when he repeated the term “pussy” shouted by a person in the crowd, effectively questioning cruz’s manliness. trump went on to win the state’s primary the next day, ahead of the third place cruz by a 3 to 1 margin. “it’s one of the reasons i won. you have to be yourself,” trump said in a television interview on nbc’s today show. trump later promised to clean up his foul language and to be more presidential.   history suggests the language could turn even more coarse in the run up to next saturday’s republican nominating contest in south carolina. it was there that u.s. senator john mccain of arizona was accused in 2000 of fathering an illegitimate african american child, and former massachusetts governor mitt romney in 2008 of supporting polygamy.  “these adults are acting like elementary children,”  leslie mcrobbie, a former fifth grade schoolteacher from new hampshire, said of this year’s republican contenders.   president barack obama, a democrat, this week spoke of the snark that characterized a republican race of the past when he recalled that ronald reagan was described by rivals as an “unshapely man” and a “yahoo” before his election as president in 1980. coming off the first nominating contests in iowa and new hampshire, the seven remaining candidates for the republican nomination are under pressure either to break away from the crowd or prevent others from doing so.  insults can foster that. former florida governor jeb bush, mocked more than once by trump as a “low energy” candidate, has since retaliated by tweeting that trump was “not just a loser,” but also a “liar and a whiner.” the put down was re tweeted nearly 3,000 times and “liked” by more than 4,000 users.   cruz, responding to trump’s decision to skip a fox news hosted republican debate, branded his rival “ducking donald” and sponsored a special edition filter on picture sharing app snapchat that featured a blond haired duck with an exaggerated pout meant to represent the real estate mogul. “when we create so much of the modern campaign around the characters that are running, and not on the subjects, the natural byproduct of that is calling people names,” said political scientist michael artime. artime said that while bickering and name calling have always existed in elections, this cycle has seen a notable uptick in the negative. “in the past, if somebody would’ve said what trump said the other night, that would have been a very damaging thing to their campaign,” artime said. “the kind of politics we get is kind of the politics we deserve,” he said.  while many have gleefully or indifferently watched as candidates hurled barb after barb, others have condemned it. “bullying can be highly instrumental and used for social climbing,” said bob faris, associate professor of sociology at university of california davis, who studies aggressive behavior in adolescents. “and it works,” he said, “provided that kids target the right kids.” for trump, perhaps the most blustery of the candidates, the target is constantly changing, his numbers remaining constant in the opinion polls while he assails rivals for being “stupid,” “weak” and “pathetic.” “he does look like a bully,” faris said. “donald is a whole new development. i can’t think of a candidate like him.” presidential historian mike purdy, however, cites a precedent in the late republican president theodore roosevelt. “roosevelt loved more than anything else to be the center of attention, and he had a huge, huge ego,” purdy said. “they both have a certain amount of ego. they both have trouble controlling their mouths,” purdy said, likening roosevelt to trump. purdy said roosevelt called his onetime ally william howard taft a “fathead” during the 1912 presidential campaign, and went on to say then rival taft, seeking re election at the time, had the “brains of a guinea pig.” neither won the race. purdy noted the attacks also came at the expense of substantive political discourse.  “they’re incredibly personal attacks, and they’re not just attacks just on somebody’s position, they’re attacks about personal characteristics,” he said. “that is part of the civility i think we need to recapture.” on friday, trump suggested he agreed. “i do this for effect,” trump said of his foul language in an interview with wor radio in new york. “as we get closer, you will be shocked at how presidential i will be. you will be very proud of me.”  (editing by richard valdmanis and howard goller) sap is the sponsor of this content. it was independently created by reuters’ editorial staff and funded in part by sap, which otherwise has no

" the trump administration’s search for a new fbi director hit roadblocks on tuesday when two high profile potential candidates, a moderate judge and a conservative senator, signaled they did not want the job. advisers to judge merrick garland and u.s. senator john cornyn of texas told reuters they discouraged them from leading the federal bureau of investigation, cautioning that they would be leaving important, secure jobs for one fraught with politics and controversy.  the advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the new fbi director would have little job security and heightened scrutiny by political observers following president donald trump’s abrupt firing of james comey on may 9.  garland and cornyn distancing themselves from the selection process just three days before trump has said he may make a decision, points to the difficulties the white house has in filling the fbi post amid turmoil in the administration.     trump’s firing of comey, the man in charge of an investigation into possible collusion between 2016 election campaign associates and the russian government, outraged many lawmakers, including some republicans. garland, the chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, “loves his job and is not interested in leaving the judiciary,” said one source familiar with the judge’s thinking. cornyn said in a statement that he had informed the white house that “the best way i can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the u.s. senate.” white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on tuesday that an announcement on fbi director was still possible before  trump leaves on his first foreign trip on friday. he said the u.s. department of justice was still interviewing candidates. several republican senators had promoted garland even though they had refused to give him a hearing when republican trump’s predecessor president barack obama, a democrat, nominated garland last year for a then vacant seat on the u.s. supreme court. the republicans’ reasoning appeared to be that garland would be accepted by democrats and help restore faith in the fbi as a nonpartisan agency. in an interview on bloomberg television, republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell referred to garland, a former federal prosecutor, as “an apolitical professional.” a second garland acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity said garland sought advice from those who told him he would be leaving his life long position on the federal bench to take a job that could be terminated by trump overnight. a republican senate aide said cornyn’s staff also worried that the third term texas senator could cut his  and their own  careers short by going to the fbi.  an adviser to another candidate on the white house short list, former new york city police commissioner ray kelly, 75, said kelly is also being persuaded to step out of the running.  kelly has not said that he would not consider the job, but so far he has not been interviewed. republican representative trey gowdy, a former federal prosecutor whose name had been floated, said on monday he was not interested in the director position.  the difficulty in filling key administration jobs is not just limited to the fbi director post. trump’s habits of contradicting his top aides, demanding personal loyalty and punishing officials who contradict him in public has discouraged a number of experienced people from pursuing jobs, said three people who declined to discuss possible positions with administration officials. “it’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract good people to work in this administration,” said one senior official. “in other cases, veteran people with expertise are leaving or seeking posts overseas and away from this white house.” ",0
" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on sunday he does not regret using a government plane to travel to kentucky in august with his wife to view the solar eclipse and speak to business leaders, calling it “completely justifiable.” mnuchin’s use of the plane at taxpayers’ expense prompted an outcry from democratic lawmakers and interest groups and spurred a government watchdog to begin examining whether it violated travel or ethics policies.  “it was approved by the white house and there were reasons why we needed to use that plane that are completely justifiable,” he said on nbc’s “meet the press” program. cabinet members rarely use government planes or chartered aircraft for domestic travel, but the practice has received significant attention in the wake of mnuchin’s trip. on friday, former health and human services secretary tom price resigned after an outcry over his use of private charter planes for government business at a cost of nearly $52,000.  mnuchin told nbc that he would only use a private plane for government purposes “if either there was a national security issue or we couldn’t get somewhere.” the treasury department has described mnuchin’s trip in august as official government travel. mnuchin spoke to business leaders in louisville and visited fort knox, the site of significant u.s. gold reserves. mnuchin and his wife, louise linton, also viewed the aug. 21 solar eclipse in kentucky with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and others.  public uproar over the trip began to mount after linton posted a photo of herself deboarding the plane on social media and listed the expensive designer brands she was wearing in the caption.

" the tax writing committee of the u.s. house of representatives will begin holding hearings on a republican tax reform proposal next week, the panel’s chairman said on tuesday, even as the timeline for overhauling the tax code slips toward late 2017. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady told fox news he would soon announce a hearing schedule to examine his house tax reform blueprint with its proposal to tax imports, a plan that appears to have lost ground as the white house works to unveil its own approach. the investment consulting firm veda partners advised clients on tuesday to expect an april 27 hearing on the import tax proposal known as the border adjustment tax, or bat. brady’s committee could not confirm the date or topic, but he told fox news the committee “will soon be announcing congressional hearings on our blueprint starting next week.”  he also acknowledged that the tax reform timeline could slip as house republicans try to reach agreement to repeal and replace the affordable care act, known as obamacare, following their failed attempt to pass healthcare legislation in march. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week that tax reform may not get done before an august deadline.  “we probably ought not be focused on the month but the year that it happens, which is this year,” brady said. “if it moves a little past august and still lands in this year, it’s going to be an incredible achievement.” much of the debate has focused on the house republican bat proposal, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, while exempting exports from taxation. the proposal is opposed by import dependent industries and republicans who worry it could lead to higher consumer prices. tax experts say the proposal’s future depends on whether the white house backs it. president donald trump, who dislikes the term “border adjustment,” said on tuesday his tax reform plan would create “a level playing field” for u.s. industry   a phrase widely viewed as referring to some kind of border tax. brady identified the critical elements of legislation as significant rate reduction, full and immediate expensing for capital investments and a simplified tax code.   he cautioned against straightforward rate reductions of the kind that some in congress have begun to consider. “a rate cut alone would have worked in the 1980s. it doesn’t in 2017 if we’re going to be competitive,” brady said.

" u.s. president donald trump repeatedly urged senior senate republicans over the summer to end the senate intelligence committee’s probe into russian meddling in the 2016 election, including the panel’s chairman, the new york times reported on thursday, citing several lawmakers and aides.  senator richard burr, the committee's chairman, said in an interview this week trump told him that he was eager to see the investigation come to an end, the times reported. (nyti.ms/2alkdmt) “it was something along the lines of, ‘i hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible,’” burr told the times. he said he replied to trump that “when we have exhausted everybody we need to talk to, we will finish,” the newspaper reported. the panel is among several congressional committees, along with the justice department’s special counsel robert mueller, investigating allegations that russia sought to influence the u.s. election and potential collusion by trump’s campaign. moscow has denied any meddling and trump has said there was no collusion.  white house spokesman raj shah said on thursday that the president had not acted improperly, the times reported. trump “at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members” and believes “there is no evidence of collusion and these investigations must come to a fair and appropriate completion,” the newspaper quoted shah as saying. white house officials did not immediately respond to a request by reuters for comment. trump’s requests were a highly unusual intervention from a president into a legislative inquiry involving his family and close aides, the times said. trump also told senator mitch mcconnell, the republican leader, and republican senator roy blunt, a member of the intelligence committee, to end the investigation swiftly, the times reported, citing lawmakers and aides. spokesmen for mcconnell, burr and blunt did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the times quoted democratic senator dianne feinstein, a former chairwoman of the intelligence committee, as saying in an interview this week that trump’s requests were “inappropriate” and represented a breach of the separation of powers. “it is pressure that should never be brought to bear by an official when the legislative branch is in the process of an investigation,” feinstein was quoted as saying.

" iraqi forces launched an operation on thursday to clear the desert bordering syria of islamic state in a final push to rid iraq of the militant group, the military said. troops from the iraqi army and mainly shi ite paramilitaries known as popular mobilisation forces (pmf) were taking part in the campaign against militants hiding in a large strip of border land, iraqi military officials said.  the objective behind the operation is to prevent remaining daesh groups from melting into the desert region and using it as a base for future attacks,  said army colonel salah kareem, referring to islamic state by an arabic acronym. islamic state fighters who ruled over millions of people in both iraq and syria since proclaiming their  caliphate  in 2014, have been largely defeated in both countries this year, pushed out of all population centers to empty desert near the border. iraqi prime minister haider al abadi said on tuesday  islamic state had been defeated from a military perspective, but he would declare final victory only after the militants were routed in the desert. [nl8n1nr57c] in the latest operation, iraqi forces had  purified  77 villages and exerted control over a bridge and an airport, operations commander lieutenant general abdul ameer rasheed yarallah said in a statement. over 5,800 squared kilometers had been  purified,  he added. on friday iraqi forces captured the border town of rawa, the last remaining town under islamic state control. iraqi army commanders say the military campaign will continue until all the frontier with syria is secured to prevent islamic state from launching cross border attacks.  we will completely secure the desert from all terrorist groups of daesh and declare iraq clean of those germs,  said army brigadier general shakir kadhim. army officials said troops advancing through sprawling desert towards the syria border are facing landmines and roadside bombs placed by retreating militants.  we need to clean scattered villages from terrorists to make sure they no longer operate in the desert area with syria,  said army lieutenant colonel ahmed fairs.  iraqi military helicopters provided cover for the advancing troops and destroyed at least three vehicles used by militants as they were trying to flee a village in the western desert, said the army officer. islamic state s self declared caliphate has swiftly collapsed since july, when u.s. backed iraqi forces captured mosul, the group s de facto capital in iraq, after a grueling battle that had lasted nine months. driven also from its other main bastion in syria s raqqa, islamic state has since been gradually squeezed into an ever shrinking pocket of desert straddling the syria iraq frontier, pursued by a range of enemies that include most regional states and global powers. the group s leader, abu bakr al baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the stretch of desert which runs along the border of both countries.

" the united nations called on world powers on thursday to help arrange the medical evacuation of 500 people, including 167 children, from eastern ghouta, saying the besieged damascus suburb has now become a  humanitarian emergency . nine people died in recent weeks waiting for permission from the syrian government for the sick and wounded to be evacuated from the rebel held area to hospitals less than an hour drive from the capital, said jan egeland, the u.n. humanitarian adviser on syria. russia and iran, as well as the united states and france, pledged to help during the weekly humanitarian meeting, he said.  it would be incredible if they cannot deliver a simple evacuation of mainly women and children, a 40 minute drive to damascus city,  egeland told a news conference in geneva.  we are convinced that we can do the evacuation if we get a green light from the government. we can then negotiate calm with both sides.  dozens of mortar bombs landed on ghouta, the last major rebel stronghold near damascus, on wednesday, a war monitor and a witness said, despite a 48 hour truce proposed by russia to coincide with the start of peace talks in geneva.  eastern ghouta, next door to damascus, is the eye of the hurricane, it is the epicentre of this conflict. at the moment there are 400,000 people there,  egeland said. in the past two months, u.n. convoys have delivered supplies to only 68,000 of the 400,000 trapped civilians, he said.   our not being able to reach eastern ghouta for many months in most of areas has now led to an undoubtedly catastrophic situation,  egeland said. acute malnutrition rates among children there is nearly 12 percent, above the 10 percent emergency threshold, and a five  or six fold increase since january, he added.  in general i would say that no, there is no calm in this de escalation zone, there is only escalation in this de escalation zone,  egeland said.   that has ended in eastern ghouta except for (a pause of) two days only, there has been massive loss of civilian life, hundreds and hundreds have been wounded.   we need sustained calm to be able to feed 400,000 people who now beyond doubt are in a humanitarian emergency ,  he said. civilians in damascus have also been killed or wounded by mortars coming from eastern ghouta, he added. in hassakeh, in northeastern syria, u.n. aid workers found a desperate situation, egeland said.  they told about children walking around barefoot, recently displaced children, barefoot in the snow and the cold.  he hoped that the u.n. security council would agree on a resolution allowing cross border aid to continue to enter syria, supplying 2.7 million people in rebel held areas.   it is my clear understanding from all members of the security council that none wants a break of the pipeline.

" hurricane irma has killed at least five people and left a trail of destruction on the part french, part dutch caribbean island of saint martin, government officials in france and the netherlands said on thursday. packing winds of around 175 mph (290 kph), the storm lashed several small islands in the northeast caribbean, including st  martin and st barthelemy, tearing down trees, flattening homes and causing widespread damage. french prime minister edouard philippe on thursday said four bodies had been recovered on the french side of the island, revising down an earlier death toll.  the death toll is still uncertain because clearing operations are under way,  philippe told a news conference at a crisis centre in paris. about 50 people have been injured.  there is considerable damage,  philippe said, adding that local authorities in saint martin said 95 percent of the houses there had been damaged, and 60 percent were uninhabitable.  there is no electricity, no drinkable water, gasoline is unavailable.  philippe said the government would on friday declare a state of emergency, facilitating insurance compensation. government officials in the netherlands said the hurricane had caused enormous devastation on the dutch side of the island, killing one person and injuring several others. the dutch navy, which has two ships stationed off the coast, tweeted images gathered by helicopter showing damaged houses, hotels and boats. sint maarten, as it is known in dutch, is an independent nation within the kingdom of the netherlands with a population of around 40,000 people, about the same as on the french side of the island. images of the dutch side s juliana airport showed the landing strips appeared intact, although the navy said the airport was unreachable for now.

" u.s. president donald trump’s first budget proposal will spare big social welfare programs such as social security and medicare from any cuts, treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in an interview broadcast on sunday. mnuchin said trump would also use a major policy speech to a joint session of congress on tuesday night to preview some elements of his sweeping plans to cut taxes for the middle class, simplify the tax system and make american companies more globally competitive with lower rates and changes to encourage u.s. manufacturing. speaking on fox news channel’s “sunday morning futures” program, mnuchin, who has acknowledged that tax reform is his top policy priority, said the budget plan would not seek cuts to federal benefits programs known as “entitlements.” “we are not touching those now. so don’t expect to see that as part of this budget, ok,” mnuchin said of the programs, according to a transcript provided by fox. “we are very focused on other aspects and that’s what’s very important to us. and that’s the president’s priority.” trump during his election campaign promised not to cut social security, medicare healthcare for seniors nor medicaid healthcare for the poor. preservation of these programs, coupled with a middle class tax cut, would aid the retirees and working class americans who make up a significant portion of trump’s political base. in a transcript of the fox news channel interview, mnuchin said trump will be “touching on tax reform” in his speech. mnuchin said the plan would cut the number of tax brackets and “create a level playing field for u.s. companies to be able to compete in the world.” but wall street, which has sent stocks to record highs on anticipation of trump’s tax cut plans, has grown impatient and could react negatively to a lack of substantive details about the plan in trump’s speech, financial analysts said.    with both chambers of the u.s. congress in republican hands, trump has the potential to enact major elements of his legislative agenda.  but divisions with the republican party over the approach on obamacare and taxes could prove to be an obstacle. some republican lawmakers have urged trump to lay out more specifics on his policy plans, saying that more white house engagement is needed to build momentum in congress for his agenda. mnuchin offered little new information and said key tax plan  elements were not yet settled. he said trump was looking at a “reciprocal tax” that would help create more trade parity with other countries. trump administration officials have complained that many countries charge value added taxes on imports while exempting exports from taxation. but mnuchin again said he was still “studying very carefully” a house republican border tax adjustment plan that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports to encourage more u.s. based production and exports. that plan aims to raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade to offset lower tax rates for businesses. “there are certain aspects that the president likes about the concept of a border adjusted tax, there are certain aspects that he’s very concerned about,” mnuchin said.  he added that the trump administration would work with the house of representatives and senate to craft “a combined plan that takes the best of all of this when we bring it forward.” in a comment suggesting that trump’s budget and tax plans may use aggressive revenue assumptions, mnuchin said the administration “fundamentally believes in dynamic scoring,” a budget calculation method that assumes that a lower tax burden boosts revenues by encouraging economic activity. the congressional budget office has previously used mainly “static” scoring methods that assume very conservative economic effects of tax and budget changes.

" liberia s ruling party, which came second in a presidential election first round on oct. 10, has said the poll was marred by irregularities, following similar claims from other parties. vice president joseph boakai, a member of outgoing president ellen johnson sirleaf s unity party, won 28.8 percent of votes, versus 38.4 percent for former soccer star george weah. a run off vote between the two candidates is scheduled for nov. 7.  international observers from the european union, the carter center and the national democratic institute have said they saw no major problems with the vote, which was meant to usher in liberia s first democratic transfer of power since 1944.   the unity party did not say whether it would petition the election committee for a re run, as did the liberty party of the third placed candidate, charles brumskine, over what it said were  gross irregularities and fraud .  we too have been gathering reports ... pointing to some anomalies and electoral management inefficiencies, which prevented some of our supporters and citizens from exercising their constitutional rights to vote,  the unity party said in a statement. it said it was still deciding what action to take  consistent with the laws of liberia . another candidate, alexander cummings of the alternative national congress, has also said there were problems during the polls, including the theft of ballot boxes, but his party has yet to file a complaint.  the communications director of the election commission, henry flomo, said the commission would respond to the unity party s concerns as quickly as possibly, adding that the party could challenge the commission s findings at the supreme court if it is not satisfied.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif on tuesday discussed ways of ensuring that last year’s historic nuclear deal between tehran and world powers is implemented the way it was originally envisioned. “we agreed we’re both working at making sure that the ... nuclear agreement is implemented in exactly the way that it is meant to be and that all the parties to that agreement get the benefits that they are supposed to get out of the agreement,” kerry told reporters at united nations headquarters in new york. “we will meet again to sort of solidify what we talked about today,” he said, adding that he and zarif would resume discussions in new york on friday on the sidelines of a signing ceremony at the u.n. for the paris climate agreement. zarif said they discussed ways to “make sure that we will draw the benefits that iran is entitled to from the implementation of the agreement.” tehran’s top diplomat added that he and kerry on friday would discuss ways of getting their ideas into operation. neither kerry nor zarif offered any details about the ideas they discussed. u.s. officials said on monday that kerry was expected to raise tehran’s concerns over difficulties accessing the global financial system despite the lifting of some u.s. sanctions under the nuclear deal. iran and six world powers clinched a historic nuclear agreement in july 2015, which allowed for the easing of some sanctions imposed by the united states, european union and united nations in return for tehran curbing its nuclear program. tehran has called on the united states to do more to remove obstacles to the banking sector so that businesses feel comfortable with investing in iran without penalties. current u.s. policy bars foreign banks from clearing dollar based transactions with iran through u.s. banks. but u.s. officials have said the obama administration is considering ways in which non u.s. companies could use the dollar in some business transactions with iran. state department spokesman john kirby said on monday that kerry would also press iran to use its influence over the syrian government to end syria’s five year old civil war.  neither kerry nor zarif mentioned syria.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has maintained a hiring freeze at the state department even though it was lifted for the rest of the federal government, a spokesman said on thursday, as the agency begins to downsize before congress approves funding cuts.  acting state department spokesman mark toner confirmed that the hiring freeze would remain until the plan to downsize and reorganize had been fully developed. he could not give a timeline for the reorganization. “we can’t be onboarding people when we don’t know what our reorganization is going to ultimately look like,” toner told a briefing for reporters. trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year starting oct. 1 would cut 28 percent of the budget for u.s. diplomacy and foreign aid. republicans and democrats in congress, which approves the budget, have rejected the prospect of such cuts. it was not known whether the white house directed tillerson to keep the hiring freeze in place for the state department or whether other agencies would also refuse to lift the hiring ban. two state department officials said tillerson plans to downsize staff over a period of two to three years. tillerson informed state department employees of the decision on wednesday, according to an internal memo seen by reuters. while trump’s original hiring freeze notice on jan. 23 excluded political appointees, it has stopped the hiring of rank and file workers and the replacement of others who have resigned or retired. william hoagland, senior vice president of the bipartisan policy center, a washington based think tank, said the trump administration may have to seek congressional approval if the hiring freeze changes the function of programs congress explicitly voted to fund.  hoagland said the administration would have to send what is known as an impoundment resolution if the state department “jeopardizes what that agency is there to begin with by not filling positions that are vacated.” congress would then have to approve the resolution, hoagland said.  the state department’s toner said tillerson was not breaking any federal rule by maintaining the hiring freeze.  “my understanding is that (tillerson) has the jurisdiction to keep this freeze in place as we go about this presidentially mandated” reorganization, toner said.  the office of management and budget, which handles federal budgeting, did not respond to a request for comment.     trump’s budget director mick mulvaney told reporters on tuesday that the hiring freeze would be lifted but that agencies will be asked to remain mindful of trump’s goal to reduce the federal work force. tillerson said in march that the state department’s current spending was “simply not sustainable.”     ",0

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan is running again for the job in the next congress, a spokeswoman said on thursday after a media report quoted several unidentified house republicans as saying they expected him to step down next week. “he is running,” ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong said. the hill cited four house republicans as saying that they expected ryan to step aside as speaker after next tuesday’s general election. “speculation is growing that paul will not return,” the hill quoted a “senior gop lawmaker close to leadership” as saying. it quoted a member of the freedom caucus, a group of conservative republicans, as saying that if democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton wins, ryan will get “a good share of the blame” among house members who support republican candidate donald trump. ryan last month told fellow republicans that he would not defend or campaign for trump and would instead focus on re electing republicans to keep the majority in the house. this angered some trump supporters in the house, who felt the wisconsin congressman should stand by trump. one of them, representative jim bridenstine of oklahoma, tweeted: “if paul ryan isn’t for trump, then i’m not for paul ryan.” but ryan, who as speaker is the country’s highest ranking republican, has a great deal of support in the republican caucus, and it is far from clear that his critics would be able to oust him if they tried. house republicans, who currently number 246, plan to have closed door leadership elections in mid november. ryan is expected to win their nomination for speaker at that gathering, but the actual election to the speaker’s post would not be held until the new congress convenes in january. all members of the house, both republican and democrat, will vote in the speaker election and ryan will need 218 votes   a majority of the house’s 435 members   to win. this could be a challenge if republicans lose a substantial number of seats in next week’s elections, and if some of those who remain decide to oppose ryan.

" anti establishment slovenian presidential candidate marjan sarec, who narrowly lost to president borut pahor in an election runoff on sunday, is likely to run for parliament in general elections due next june, political analysts said.  i expect sarec to announce his candidacy very soon. he might win, supported by a large number of voters who are dissatisfied with the political establishment,  tanja staric, an analyst at radio slovenia, told reuters on monday. sarec finished with 47 percent to pahor s 53 percent in the runoff, the tightest presidential race result since slovenia s independence in 1991 from then federal yugoslavia.  sarec, 39, whose center left lista marjana sarca has so far been active only at local level, indicated he will run for parliament.  my result (at the presidential election) is very good, i am very happy with it...this is not my last word in politics,  he said on his twitter account late on sunday. sarec says changes of approach are needed to further improve slovenia s economy and lift living standards. in an anti establishment pitch, he calls for politicians to listen to voters closely and come up with practical solutions to their problems. he also wants electoral rule changes to allow people to vote for individual candidates rather than parties. sarec is a former actor and comedian whose second mandate as mayor of kamnik in northern slovenia expires next year. analysts forecast election defeat next year for the party of modern centre of prime minister miro cerar because of widespread  dissatisfaction, particularly over lengthening waiting times for examinations and other procedures in the national health system. the government faces pressure for public sector wage hikes but wants to keep a lid on spending given relatively high levels of budget deficit and public debt. a poll published by daily newspaper delo on monday showed social democrats, earlier led by pahor before he ran for president as independent though still with sd support, led with 19.8 percent, followed by main opposition, center right slovenian democratic party with 13.8 percent. another poll released on monday by the nova24tv website put the sds in the lead with 15.8 percent, trailed by the sd at 11.2 percent, with half the electorate still undecided. pollsters have so far not included sarec s party in their soundings.

" the lebanese president appeared to defend hezbollah as necessary to resist israel on monday, after an arab league statement accused the group of terrorism and noted it is part of lebanon s coalition government.   israeli targeting still continues and it is the right of the lebanese to resist it and foil its plans by all available means,  president michel aoun s office quoted him as saying in a tweet.  the heavily armed shi ite muslim hezbollah, formed by iran s revolutionary guards, fought israel s occupation of lebanon in the early 1980s and says its weapons are still needed against israel.  saudi arabia, a regional rival of iran, opposes hezbollah s role as a military force in syria and has accused it of helping the houthi group in yemen and militants in bahrain.      the arab league met on sunday to discuss what it called iranian interference in arab countries, and accused tehran s ally hezbollah of terrorism.  aoun said that lebanon could not accept suggestions that its government was a partner in acts of terrorism, another tweet quoted him as saying after meeting arab league secretary general ahmed aboul gheit in beirut.  aboul gheit said in beirut that nobody was accusing lebanon s government of terrorism or wanted to harm lebanon.   one of the ruling partners is accused of this...it is an indirect means of asking the lebanese state to talk to this partner and convince them to restrain their acts on arab land,  he said.  everyone acknowledges the particularity of the lebanese situation.   lebanon faces a political crisis after its prime minister saad al hariri suddenly resigned on nov. 4 in a statement broadcast from saudi arabia. his resignation statement accused iran and hezbollah of  sowing strife  in arab countries.

" when zimbabwean leader robert mugabe sacked his vice president in front of 12,000 baying party members in 2014, emmerson mnangagwa sat quietly in the crowd, a green baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. the man who stood to gain most from the dismissal betrayed nothing through his expression and gentle clapping   a survival tactic honed during five decades of service to the mercurial mugabe. his cap, however, spoke volumes. emblazoned across its front, next to a portrait of mugabe, were four words:  indigenise, empower, develop, employ    a slogan of the ruling zanu pf party. speaking at the congress, mnangagwa reinforced the message from his headgear, announcing revisions to the party s constitution that backed  total ownership and control  of zimbabwe s natural resources. it was a key insight to the party s direction as it contemplated life beyond mugabe.  we will remain forever masters of our own destiny,  mnangagwa said, to cheers from the crowd. with mugabe, 93, held following wednesday s military takeover in harare, questions have arisen about what the future holds for mnangagwa, whose sacking from the post of vice president last week brought the political crisis to a head.  there are no arguments around his credentials to provide strong leadership and stability, but there are questions over whether he can also be a democrat,  said eldred masunungure, a political science lecturer at the university of zimbabwe. the whereabouts of mugabe s wife grace, 52, whose prospects of succeeding the president appeared to have been helped by mnangagwa s dismissal, are presently unknown.   with his appointment in 2014 as official deputy to mugabe, mnangagwa had appeared well set as the eventual successor to africa s oldest head of state. the 75 year old was one of mugabe s most trusted lieutenants, having been at his side in prison, during wartime and then in government. along the way, he earned the nickname  ngwena , shona for crocodile, an animal famed in zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness. mnangagwa backed mugabe s economic nationalism, especially a drive to force foreign firms to hand majority stakes to local blacks, suggesting he may not be the pro market pragmatist many investors were hoping for. he has been in every administration since independence, holding posts as varied as minister of state security, defense and finance, as well as speaker of parliament. most controversially, he was in charge of internal security in the mid 1980s when mugabe deployed a crack north korean trained brigade against rebels loyal to his rival joshua nkomo. rights groups say 20,000 civilians, mostly from the ndebele tribe, were killed. mugabe denies genocide or crimes against humanity but has admitted it was a  moment of madness . mnangagwa s role remains shrouded in mystery, typical of a political operator trained as a communist guerrilla in china in the 1960s and who always stayed in the shadows behind mugabe. secretive and insular, he prefers to operate under the radar, those in his inner circle say, and when pushed into a corner, resorts to jokes and trivia to avoid serious discussion.  i wouldn t say he is deceptive but it s fair to say his default position is to crack jokes and deflect uncomfortable questions by asking endless questions,  one member of parliament close to him said.  he is very conscious that his public image is that of a hard man but he is a much more complex personality   pleasant and an amazing story teller,  the politician, also from mnangagwa s midlands province, told reuters. mnangagwa s appointment as vice president appointment came a day after his predecessor joice mujuru was fired for allegedly planning to topple mugabe. asked whether the purge would weaken the party, a smiling mnangagwa said:  the revolution has a way of strengthening itself. it goes through cycles, this is another cycle where it rids itself of elements that had now become inconsistent with the correct line.  mnangagwa learnt his politics in prison in the 1960s after being sentenced to death for sabotage by british authorities following his capture while in one of the earliest guerrilla units fighting white colonial rule in what was then rhodesia. he was 19 and only spared the noose by a law prohibiting the execution of convicts under 21. after a decade in prison, often sharing a cell with mugabe, mnangagwa became personal assistant to the leader of the liberation struggle, and went on to head the guerrilla movement s feared internal security bureau. in january, a photograph appeared in local media showing mnangagwa enjoying drinks with a friend. in his hand was a large novelty mug emblazoned with the words:  i m the boss.  to supporters of mugabe, this bordered on treason. they suspected that mnangagwa already saw himself in the leader s shoes. when mugabe fired mnangagwa as vice president last week for showing  traits of disloyalty , he removed a possible successor who was also one of his last remaining liberation war comrades. but relations had already cooled between the two men after suggestions by mnangagwa s allies in august that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the mugabes.

" u.s. president donald trump will urge president xi jinping to make good on his commitments to pressure north korea when he visits china next month, a senior white house official said on monday, stepping up a strategy to have beijing help rein in pyongyang. isolating north korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. trump will call on xi to fully implement u.n. security council resolutions against pyongyang and take other steps to pressure north korea.  china, north korea s sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. china has said it will strictly enforce u.n. security council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the north.      but a senior white house official who briefed reporters ahead of trump s trip said china needs to do more to comply with two u.n. security council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with china s support.  we would like to see china follow through on those commitments. we would like to see china do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those u.n. security council resolutions,  the official said. though china has been angered by north korea s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, beijing also sees the united states and south korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. south korea, the united states and japan started a two day missile tracking drill on tuesday, south korea s military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from north korea. the exercises will be held in waters off the coasts of south korea and japan, south korea s joint chiefs of staff said, with four aegis combat system equipped ships from all three countries participating in the drill. china s special envoy for the north korea nuclear issue, kong xuanyou, met his u.s. counterpart, joseph yun, in beijing on monday, china s foreign ministry said, where they had a  deep exchange of views on the korean peninsula issue . the ministry did not elaborate. trump, who has threatened to  totally destroy  north korea, has frequently asked china to help rein in north korean leader kim jong un. but this strategy has so far failed to stop pyongyang conducting nuclear bomb tests at an underground facility and firing ballistic missile tests into the pacific ocean over japan. the threat from north korea has grown to a  critical and imminent level  and the united states, japan and south korea must address the matter, japanese defence minister itsunori onodera told his u.s. and south korean counterparts in talks on monday. onodera s remarks underscored the deep concern in tokyo about north korean weapons tests as pyongyang seeks to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of reaching the united states. the white house official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the north korea standoff. asked by reporters whether an offer by former president jimmy carter to serve as a u.s. envoy to north korea would be accepted, the official said:  there s nothing planned.  singapore prime minister lee hsien loong said on monday he outlined for trump his country s efforts to pressure north korea over its nuclear program but also advised the u.s. leader to use talks to help resolve the conflict.  there is no quick and easy solution. pressure is necessary but so is dialogue. the u.s. will need to work with others, including china, south korea and japan and russia to resolve the issue,  he said. with xi consolidating power in the wake of a communist party congress in beijing, trump believes the chinese president will have a greater authority to take steps against north korea, senior administration officials said last week. trump s nov. 3 14 trip will include visits to japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. trump will also be tough on trade during talks with xi as he seeks to reduce the u.s. trade deficit with china, the white house official said.  we have huge barriers that americans companies have to surmount to gain access to the chinese market. the president is intent on rectifying that situation,  the official said.    despite trump s fierce criticism of china s trade practices during the presidential campaign, he has mostly held off on any major trade action while his administration works with beijing on north korea. china has insisted it is doing all it can, and some chinese diplomats say the trump administration has overestimated how much influence beijing has over its defiant neighbor. even as china has shown signs of tightening enforcement of sanctions on north korea, it has stopped short of agreeing to u.s. demands for a fuel embargo and has urged the united states to negotiate with pyongyang.

" hillary clinton told a majority black church in north carolina on sunday that she knows her grandchildren are growing up in a different world than many black youth in the u.s. who are concerned about police shootings and gun violence in their communities. the democratic presidential nominee’s remarks at the little rock ame zion church in charlotte were a frank acknowledgment of the impact of what she has called “implicit bias” in policing can have on black communities. clinton cited the death of 43 year old keith scott, a black man who was shot by police in front of a charlotte apartment complex on sept. 20. she also lamented the death of 40 year old terence crutcher, who was shot days before during a tulsa traffic stop. both shootings led to community protests. the tulsa police officer has pleaded not guilty to a manslaughter charge. “i’m a grandmother, and like every grandmother, i worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,” clinton said. clinton described testimony that taje gaddy, 10, and zianna oliphant, 9, gave last week before the charlotte city council about violence in their community. clinton later summoned oliphant to join her on the stage. “i wouldn’t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. but because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let’s be honest here, they won’t face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council,” clinton said. clinton has made gun violence a focus of her presidential campaign. mothers who have lost children in shootings have joined her on the campaign trail. clinton has said police officers should be trained to recognize implicit bias and called for the official police video of the charlotte shooting to be released. donald trump, the republican nominee, said at a rally after crutcher’s shooting that it looked like he had done “everything he was supposed to do.”  on twitter, he criticized clinton’s trip to charlotte, which was postponed one week at the behest of the city’s mayor, as a chance to “grandstand.” (this version of the story was refiled to fix typographical error in paragraph 1, changes to “police” shootings and corrects typo in headline)  ",0

" the syrian army and its allies are fighting to secure a corridor to troops in deir al zor, a day after they smashed through islamic state lines to break the jihadist siege.  the army reached deir al zor city on tuesday in a days long thrust that followed months of steady advances east across the desert, breaking a siege that had lasted three years.  islamic state counter attacks lasted through the day, trying to repel the army, the syrian observatory for human rights said. fierce battles raged around the city, as troops sought to expand the route and allow aid in, the british based war monitor added.   work is progressing to secure the route and widen the flanks so as not to be cut or targeted by (islamic state),  said a commander in the military alliance backing syrian president bashar al assad.   the next step is to liberate the city,  the non syrian commander said.     it points to a tough battle ahead as the army aims to move from breaching the siege to driving islamic state militants from their half of the city, the sort of street by street warfare in which they excel.         syrian state news agency sana said the army had made gains expanding its control near the corridor after heavy artillery and air strikes.  assad and his allies   russia, iran and shi ite militias including hezbollah   will follow the relief of deir al zor with an offensive along the euphrates valley, the commander said.  the euphrates valley cuts a lush, populous swathe of green about 260 km (160 miles) long and 10 km (6 miles) wide through the syrian desert from raqqa to the iraqi border at al bukamal.   the area has been an islamic state stronghold in syria but came under attack this year when a u.s. backed alliance of kurdish and arab militias besieged and assaulted raqqa.  rapidly losing territory in syria and iraq, islamic state is falling back on the euphrates towns downstream of deir al zor, including al mayadin and al bukamal, where many expect it to make a last stand.  still, the jihadist group specializes in urban combat, using car bombs, mines, tunnels and drones, and has held out against full scale attack for months in some towns and cities.  islamic state has 6,000 8,000 fighters left in syria, despite losing most of its territory across both iraq and syria since september 2014, the united states led coalition said.  parallel with their thrust toward deir al zor, the syrian military and its allies have been fighting islamic state in its last pocket of ground in central syria, near the town of al salamiya on the homs aleppo highway.  on wednesday, army advances gained control of four villages there, further tightening the pocket, a military media unit run by lebanon s hezbollah said.  in raqqa, the u.s. backed syrian democratic forces alliance says it has taken about 65 percent of islamic state s former self declared syrian capital.  deir al zor lies along the southwest bank of the euphrates. the government enclave includes the northern half of the city and the brigade 137 military base to the west.  the army also holds an air base and nearby streets, separated from the rest of the enclave by hundreds of meters of is held ground and still cut off from the advancing army.         government forces will push toward the besieged airbase, the pro assad commander said.   instead of breaking the siege along the main road from palmyra, stretches of which remain in islamic state hands, the army reached the brigade 137 along a narrow salient from the northwest.  the corridor from the west into brigade 137 was only about 500 meters (yards) wide, the commander said.         the united nations has estimated that 93,000 civilians were living under is siege in deir al zor in  extremely difficult  conditions, with some high altitude air drops supplying them.  deir al zor s provincial governor told state run television that convoys loaded with food and medicine were on the way, along with ambulances and a mobile clinic. residents in the enclave had gone years without vegetables, fuel, and other necessities, mohammed ibrahim samra said.   despite all this, the schools kept running,  he said.  our people in deir al zor have suffered a lot ... and they still held on to their land.

" when the lawyer for the former campaign manager of president donald trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy, some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by u.s. special counsel robert mueller. paul manafort and his associate rick gates both pleaded not guilty on monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro russia former ukrainian president viktor yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts. in a court filing on thursday, manafort defense lawyer kevin downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20 year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former ukrainian leader.  downing did not respond to a request for comment. mueller spokesman peter carr declined to comment. the language of the filing and defiant statements downing made outside the courthouse following manafort’s arraignment on monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from mueller’s probe into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. the kremlin has denied meddling and trump has said there was no collusion. neither trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on monday. downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on friday. manafort’s virginia home was raided by federal bureau of investigation agents over the summer. the money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” according to the manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the u.s. foreign agent registration act (fara). though the money laundering statute includes fara violations, seattle tax lawyer john colvin said the charge against manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases. “it doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, colvin said. “it seems like a stretch to me.”  downing said in his thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating fara in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction. by pointing out the lack of previous fara prosecutions, former federal prosecutor mark lee, now a white collar defense lawyer in philadelphia, said downing was likely trying to suggest manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. the section cited by mueller requires the fara violation to be “knowing and willful.” successfully casting doubt on whether manafort intentionally violated fara could knock out the money laundering charge, lee said. “if you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said lee. former federal prosecutor michael padula, now a miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. that may be hard to show in the manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and range rovers for the conspirator’s personal use. but other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding fara would gain much traction. “the idea that somebody of mr. manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, i think, laughable,” said chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor patrick cotter. several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, mueller had strong charges based on the failure of manafort and gates to report their overseas accounts to the internal revenue service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. they also pointed out that mueller could add more charges at a later date. “it’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said padula of downing’s money laundering defense. “he’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”  ",0

" a man slipped a potentially lethal poison into food, including baby food, on sale in some german supermarkets in an extortion scheme aimed at raising millions of euros, police said on thursday. no cases of poisoning had been reported so far. police said the alleged perpetrator had alerted them by e mail after placing quantities of poison in products for sale in some southern german supermarkets earlier in september, and was now threatening to do so nationwide and elsewhere in europe unless given a pay off of many millions.  we are taking the threat very seriously,  uwe stuermer, deputy chief of police in the southern lakeside city of konstanz, told a news conference.  there is no reason for panic or hysteria,  he added, while warning consumers to be on the look out for packaging that had been tampered with when buying their groceries. police were looking for a suspect who could be seen in security video footage from one of the supermarkets in a town near konstanz and appeared to be a man of around 50. the footage was made public to help in the search. police said they had found some baby food spiked with ethylene glycol, a colorless, odorless liquid used in the manufacture of antifreeze, which can be deadly if consumed. authorities in the southwestern state of baden wuerttemberg said they would intensify checks of food on sale, but warned that identifying contaminated items would be a challenge.  the case is difficult because the blackmailer did not say which food will be targeted or what poison he will use,  a consumer protection official said.

" the 100 democratic women who packed into a suburban maryland conference room recently for a one day training on how to run for political office were more than activists eager to battle president donald trump and his fellow republicans. the teachers, students and business leaders were also a window into the future for a democratic party desperate for new blood, and into the booming effort to turn the left’s grassroots anti trump activism into a new wave of democratic officeholders. as thousands of potential first time candidates explore  political bids in what democratic veterans say is an unprecedented surge of activity, a broad but informal network of groups is beefing up efforts to train them for the task. the goal: turning neophytes into successful politicians who can win, giving the party a deep and diverse bench of up and coming progressive talent at all levels of government. “this era of trump has made everybody just want to run for office, and it’s not easy,” said josh morrow, executive director of 314 action, which since its founding last year has heard from about 6,000 scientists, engineers and mathematicians exploring  political runs and trained nearly 500 of them. “no matter how accomplished people are, they need help when they first run,” morrow said. the surge of interest has given dispirited democrats, long criticized as a top heavy party lacking fresh faces, hope for a renaissance at the local and state levels after repeated setbacks under president barack obama. building from the ground up, from the school board to the statehouse, is a party priority after losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats in the last eight years. republicans also control the white house, both chambers of congress and 33 governor’s offices, the most in nearly a century. “local offices matter, and as democrats we have sort of forgotten that,” said amanda litman, a staffer on democrat hillary clinton’s presidential campaign who founded the group run for something after the 2016 election to recruit and prepare millennials for office. for first timers, the initial enthusiasm for public service can quickly give way to worried questions about the logistics of building a fundraising list, utilizing social media and crafting a message. “i knew i had a steep learning curve,” said thereasa black, a lawyer and navy veteran running for the u.s. congress from maryland. she attended the rockville session run by emerge america, which prepares women for office. “this is a way to find people who are like minded and going through what you are, and can help you,” she said. a republican spokesman said democrats would need more than training and fresh faces to gain ground in next year’s midterm elections given the losses of first time democratic candidates in special congressional races in georgia and montana earlier this year. “the challenges that democrats face go much deeper and come down to fundraising and messaging,” said rick gorka, a spokesman for the republican national committee, which sponsored a training program for about 4,500 volunteer field staff and operatives last year. geoffrey dittberner, 30, said he had volunteered on campaigns before deciding to run for the minnesota legislature, but he was still unprepared for being a candidate before he was accepted into run for something’s training program. “there were so many things i didn’t know   fundraising, setting up a campaign organization   but they made it pretty easy,” he said. the group’s slack application gave him access to a variety of resources, from tutorials to mentors and peer networks, discussion groups and on call experts, he said. aside from new groups like 314 action and run for something, about a dozen established organizations that have long offered training to progressive candidates also have been flooded with interest since trump’s election. emily’s list, which for years has trained women candidates who favor abortion rights, has hired five more staffers this year for a reconstituted training unit. it already has heard from 16,000 women interested in becoming candidates this year, compared to 920 in 2016. emerge america has seen applications jump by 87 percent and added five new state chapters. the maryland state chapter, which ran the one day course in rockville, had trained 250 women by mid year. last year, it trained 55. at emerge’s rockville session, candidates were encouraged to listen more than they talk and delve into their own experiences to explain what motivated them to run. “when we tap into our own personal story, we relate better to people in our community,” diane fink, executive director for emerge maryland, told the class. she asked them to put together a three minute story that explains how they got started. while democrats nationally have battled over their core message, most of the training programs say they avoid telling candidates specifically what issues to emphasize. “first and foremost you should be talking about what matters to voters, not to you,” said veteran democratic strategist kelly dietrich, who founded the national democratic training committee last year to offer free online training for any democrat running for any office. so far, more than 6,000 have signed up.

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday will order a review of national monuments created over the past 20 years with an aim toward rescinding or resizing some of them   part of a broader push to reopen areas to drilling, mining and other development. the move comes as trump seeks to reverse a slew of environmental protections ushered in by former president barack obama that he said were hobbling economic growth   an agenda that is cheering industry but enraging conservationists. interior secretary ryan zinke told reporters on tuesday trump’s executive order would require him to conduct the review of around 30 national monuments and recommend which designations should be lifted or resized over the coming months. he said he would seek feedback from congressional delegations, governors and local stakeholders before making his recommendations. “i am not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be,” zinke said. rescinding or altering a national monument designation would be new ground for the government, he said. “it is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that,” zinke said. the monuments covered by the review will range from the grand staircase in utah created by president bill clinton in 1996 to the bears ears monuments created by president barack obama in december 2016 in the same state, covering millions of acres of land overlying minerals, oil and gas.  obama’s administration created the bears ears monument arguing that it would protect the cultural legacy of the navajo and four other tribes and preserve “scenic and historic landscapes.” but utah’s governor opposed the designation, saying it went against the wishes of citizens eager for development. the area lies near where eog resources (eog.n)   a texas based company   had been approved to drill. zinke said the broader aim of the order is to give states more input in the monument designation process, and “restore trust between local communities and washington.” while he acknowledged that national monuments could bring tourism, he said he thinks federal land should be managed for “multiple uses.”  conservation groups and native american tribal representatives slammed the looming order, suggesting it would be fought in court. “with this review, the trump administration is walking into a legal, political and moral minefield,” said kate kelly, public lands director for the center for american progress.  a summary of the forthcoming order, seen by reuters, said past administrations “overused” the antiquities act that allows presidents to create monuments.

" the most consequential legal challenge to u.s. president donald trump’s travel ban will proceed on two tracks in the next few days: in a u.s. appeals court vote in san francisco and the seattle courtroom of a federal judge. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals will vote on whether to reconsider an appeal in the case that was decided in the seattle court last week. that vote could reveal which judges disagree with their colleagues on the bench and support the arguments behind the new president’s most controversial executive order. in seattle, the state of washington will attempt to probe trump’s motive in drafting the jan. 27 order. in another case, in virginia, a federal judge on late monday halted enforcement of portions of the order against virginia visa holders or permanent residents, concluding that the travel ban likely violates the u.s. constitution’s protections for freedom of religion.  the rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the president’s power on matters of immigration and national security. traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts say. trump’s directive, which he said was necessary to protect the united states from attacks by islamist militants, barred people from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen from entering the country for 90 days. refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from syria, who were banned indefinitely. the ban was backed by around half of americans, according to a reuters/ipsos poll, but triggered protests across the country and caused chaos at some u.s. and overseas airports.  u.s. district judge james robart in seattle suspended the order nationwide after washington state challenged its legality, eliciting a barrage of angry twitter messages from trump against the judge and the court system. a three judge panel at the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals in san francisco upheld the ruling last week, raising questions about trump’s next step. in the virginia case, u.s. district judge leonie brinkema said there was a lack of evidence showing a national security purpose for the executive order and issued a preliminary injunction against parts of it.  while the ruling is not on the underlying merits of the case, brinkema noted, “the ‘muslim ban’ was a centerpiece of the president’s campaign for months.”  legal experts said no other judge has so fully considered the question of whether the order amounted to a discriminatory ban on muslims. according to brinkema, “the evidence indicates the government’s purpose was based on religion,” said nelson tebbe, a professor at brooklyn law school, adding that the ruling could influence other judges’ views on the matter. at a seattle court hearing on monday, robart said he would move forward with discovery in the case, meaning the request and exchange of information pertinent to the case between the opposing parties.  meanwhile, an unidentified judge on the 9th circuit last week requested that the court’s 25 full time judges vote on whether the temporary restraining order robart imposed on trump’s travel ban should be reconsidered by an 11 judge panel, known as en banc review. the 9th circuit asked both sides to file briefs by thursday. since judges appointed by democrats hold an 18 7 edge on the 9th circuit, legal experts say it is unlikely a majority will disagree with the court’s earlier ruling and want it reconsidered.  arthur hellman, a professor at the university of pittsburgh school of law who has studied the 9th circuit, noted that one of the three judges who issued the original ruling was appointed by president george w. bush.  even if the en banc vote fails, however, judges on the 9th circuit who disagree with last week’s ruling will be able to publicly express their disagreement in court filings, which could help create a record bolstering trump’s position. meanwhile, the government has signaled that it is considering issuing a new executive order to replace the original one. in that case, it could tell the 9th circuit later this week that it does not want en banc review, because the case would be moot. “you would think jeff sessions would do whatever he had to do to get this case ended as soon as possible,” hellman said, referring to the recently appointed u.s. attorney general.

" egyptian militant group hasm claimed responsibility on sunday for a small explosion at myanmar s embassy in cairo, saying it was in retaliation for that country s military crackdown on rohingya muslims. egypt s interior ministry has not commented on saturday s blast, which residents and media initially reported as probably the result of a faulty gas pipeline. two security sources told reuters that traces of explosives had been found at the scene.  this bombing serves as a warning to the embassy of murderers, killers of women and children in the muslim rakhine state, and in solidarity with the sons of this weakened muslim population,  hasm said in its statement. it was the first time that hasm, a group blamed for several attacks targeting judges and policemen around cairo since last year, has claimed an attack on a civilian target.  (we have used) utmost caution to ensure that there were no civilian casualties or innocent people (hurt) during the operation, or else you would have seen a burning hell you could not have stopped,  hasm said in the statement.  myanmar s government spokesman urged citizens abroad to be careful.  pls take care myanmar nationals around the world,  the spokesman, zaw htay, said on his twitter feed. the latest wave of violence in western myanmar s rakhine state began on aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. the myanmar military response has sent more than 410,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh, escaping what they and rights monitors say is a campaign aimed at driving the muslim population out of the majority buddhist country. egypt accuses hasm of being a militant wing of the muslim brotherhood, an islamist group it outlawed in 2013. the muslim brotherhood denies this. hundreds of egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting an islamist insurgency in sinai that has gained pace since mid 2013, when general turned president abdel fattah al sisi ousted mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.

" bangladesh plans to allocate more land for camps housing rohingya refugees as concerns grow over a possible outbreak of disease in crowded, makeshift settlements clustered at the country s southern tip. about 625,000 rohingya muslims have fled to sanctuary in bangladesh from violence, looting and destruction in neighboring myanmar after government forces launched a counter insurgency following attacks by rohingya militants on aug. 25. the swift exodus has taken the rohingya refugee population to 837,000, making bangladesh one of the world s largest, most crowded settlement of asylum seekers. more than 60 percent of the water supply in the camps is contaminated with bacteria as temporary latrines overflow into hastily built, shallow wells, a world health organization survey showed. faecal sludge in the settlements goes largely untreated.  there is a high risk of a public health event, not just cholera and acute watery diarrhea,  said naim talukder of the group action against hunger, who is coordinating the efforts of 31 groups and agencies to manage water, sanitation and hygiene. a reuters graphic uses satellite imagery to document the mushrooming spread of the refugee areas. data show the challenge of meeting international standards for water, sanitation and hygiene in the camps and spillover sites. click on the link for the reuters graphic   tmsnrt.rs/2aomiav most refugees live in flimsy bamboo and canvas shelters in an area crowded well beyond emergency standards, said graham eastmond, an official of the international organization for migration (iom).        you are talking a third of the international standard,  he said.  we need to decongest urgently and obviously, to do that, we need more land.  the iom is among the bodies that have urged bangladesh to free up more land and allow a wider spread of settlements.  the government already allocated 3,000 acres of land for the rohingya,  shah kamal, a disaster management official, told reuters. that figure is equivalent to 1,214 hectares.  considering the current situation, the government is planning to allocate 500 acres more land for them,  he added.   last week, bangladesh approved a $280 million project to develop an isolated and flood prone island in the bay of bengal to temporarily house 100,000 rohingya, despite criticism from rights groups. the overcrowding spells health and safety risks, eastmond added, from rapidly spreading water borne and communicable diseases to landslides and flooding, besides swelling the threat to vulnerable children and women. single women or children head about a fifth of households, preliminary findings of a population survey by the u.n. refugee agency and bangladesh show. by nov. 11, there were 36,096 cases of acute watery diarrhea since aug. 25, as infection rates climbed, the u.n. children s agency said last month.     bangladesh, in partnership with u.n. agencies and charities, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in responding to the crisis. new roads built by the army will open this month, boosting access for camp dwellers, said eastmond. yet just 23 percent of funding needs for water, sanitation and hygiene services are being met, talukder said.   bangladesh and myanmar vowed to begin the voluntary return of the rohingya to myanmar in the next two months. but the rohingya will have to present identity documents in order to be accepted, said myint kyaing, a myanmar labor and immigration ministry official. relief officials fear that few rohingya, a stateless and long persecuted minority in myanmar, carried such documents in their desperate scramble to leave. hundreds of rohingya villages have been razed, their land given to others and their crops harvested.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump, stung by a meager fundraising haul compared with that of democratic rival hillary clinton, predicted on friday his campaign would draw “staggering” numbers this summer. supporters have voiced concern he will not have enough money to finance his campaign for the nov. 8 presidential election. trump had $1.3 million in cash to start the month, compared with rival democrat hillary clinton’s $42 million war chest. “the numbers are going to be, i think, quite staggering, especially in july,” trump, a new york real estate developer, said at a news conference in turnberry, scotland, where he reopened a golf resort. he said he had only begun fundraising in earnest a few weeks ago and that the numbers, especially for small donations, had been “amazing.” steve mnuchin, trump’s top fundraiser, told cnbc on thursday that in the past week the campaign had raised about $10 million together with the republican party at fundraising events. he said trump also raised $6 million through online donations. [l1n19f0vd] trump said on friday the july report “will show you some pretty massive numbers.” trump also has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the white house. ",0
" the european union wants to launch and conclude free trade negotiations with australia and new zealand in the next two years, european commission president jean claude juncker said on wednesday, opening up a potential race with britain. if juncker s timeframe is achieved, the eu could nip in ahead of the uk, which is also courting both countries but cannot negotiate independent trade deals until it leaves the eu in march 2019. juncker said there was a good chance that the eu would agree the main elements of a new free trade with the mercosur countries of argentina, brazil, paraguay and uruguay and of an updated trade partnership with mexico by the end of this year.  and today, we are proposing to open trade negotiations with australia and new zealand,  juncker told eu lawmakers.  i want all of these agreements to be finalised by the end of this mandate. and i want them negotiated in the fullest transparency,  he added. the current commission s term of office runs until oct. 31, 2019. the eu is seeking to capitalize on new trade opportunities in response to a more protectionist  america first  stance from the united states under president donald trump.  we will not miss any opportunity to step in. whatever space the americans leave behind, the europeans will occupy,  a senior u.s. official said. juncker said, however, that while europe favored open commerce, it needed reciprocity from its trading partners.  we have to get what we give,  he said. the european union was not a group of  naive free traders  and would always defend its strategic interests. the european commission is now proposing that it should have the right to review foreign investment in important assets.  if a foreign, state owned, company wants to purchase a european harbor, part of our energy infrastructure or a defense technology firm, this should only happen in transparency, with scrutiny and debate,  juncker said. france, germany and italy jointly welcomed the proposal to give member states a tool to intervene. juncker did not mention any country, but most eu concern over reciprocity and investment has centered on china. china s cosco shipping [cosco.ul] already owns a majority stake in greece s biggest port, piraeus, and a share of a terminal at europe s largest port, rotterdam. china contributed to the european union s galileo satellite navigation program, which critics say led to a massive transfer of technology.

" a senior member of israel’s government welcomed on wednesday white house spokesman sean spicer’s apology for saying adolf hitler did not use chemical weapons, comments that overlooked the killing of millions of jews in nazi gas chambers. “since he apologized and retracted his remarks, as far as (i) am concerned, the matter is over,” intelligence and transport minister israel katz said in a statement, citing the “tremendous importance of historical truth and remembrance” of the victims of the holocaust. spicer made the assertion at a daily news briefing, during a discussion about the april 4 chemical weapons attack in syria that killed 87 people. washington has blamed the attack on the government of syrian president bashar al assad. “you had someone as despicable as hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” spicer said when asked about russia’s alliance with the syrian government. the nazis murdered six million jews during world war two. many jews as well as others were killed in gas chambers in european concentration camps. when a reporter asked spicer if he wanted to clarify his comments, he said: “i think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that assad is doing.” later on tuesday, spicer apologized and said he should not have made that comparison. “it was a mistake. i shouldn’t have done it and i won’t do it again,” spicer told cnn in an interview. “it was inappropriate and insensitive.” spicer’s assertion, made during the jewish holiday of passover, sparked instant outrage on social media and from some holocaust memorial groups who accused him of minimizing hitler’s crimes. katz, a member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s party, had tweeted late on tuesday that spicer’s comments at the news briefing were “grave and outrageous”, and he said the white house spokesman should apologize or resign. there was no immediate comment from other israeli leaders, during a passover holiday period when government business is largely at a standstill and many in the country are on vacation. it was not the first time the white house has had to answer questions about the holocaust. critics in january noted the administration’s statement marking international holocaust remembrance day, which omitted any mention of jewish victims. at the time, spicer defended that statement by saying it had been written in part by a jewish staff member whose family members had survived the holocaust. despite these difficulties, relations between trump administration and the israeli government have been more cordial than under the obama presidency, although differences remain over the scope of israeli settlement building.

" t shirts inspired by republican presidential candidate donald trump’s “such a nasty woman” comment on democrat hillary clinton in wednesday night’s debate were flying off internet retailers’ shelves, offering a possible hint on the nov. 8 election result.  sellers said on thursday that demand came swiftly and was unrivaled minutes after the final debate ended. “i have had nonstop orders since last night,” pennsylvania part time graphic designer naheed snyder said of her t shirt, designed simply with the words “nasty women vote,” selling on etsy. “it’s unbelievable how well this one has done... there’s no comparison.”  merchandise retailers typically see a profit boost during election season as voters on both sides seek to wear support for their candidates, particularly around conventions, voting and this year, debates.  traffic to teespring.com, a website that allows users to create, sell and buy personalized t shirts, spiked 40 percent during the second presidential debate and 120 percent in the third debate, the company said.  merchandise promoting the republican candidate was steadily higher earlier in the race, said maheesh jain, co founder of online customizable merchandise retailer cafepress. some of the most popular items included the slogans “i am a deplorable” and “hillary for prison.”  at a fundraiser in september, clinton said trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate, and that “you can put half of trump’s supporters into what i call the ‘basket of deplorables.’” the following day she said she regretted saying “half” and that she had been “grossly generalistic.”  in the last two weeks, after the release of trump’s 2005 lewd remarks toward women and an onslaught of women accusing him of sexual harassment or assault, the items have declined in popularity, jain said. trump has apologized for the remarks and denied the accusations. “right now, we’re definitely seeing a lot more hillary merchandise selling than trump merchandise,” said jain. sales of pro clinton merchandise last week were 53.5 percent higher than for trump, jain said. after the third and final presidential debate on wednesday, trump’s “nasty woman” comment gave life to a new merchandise line aimed at assailing him. “if hillary clinton is a nasty woman for being most likely our next president, maybe that’s not such a bad thing,” said amanda brinkman, who runs the online feminist centered accessory shop google ghost. “maybe that’s something you should wear as a badge of honor.” brinkman’s “nasty woman” t shirt, featuring the phrase with a heart around it, sold more than 6,000 times since she designed and posted it during wednesday’s debate. the second most popular item in her store’s history, a pen, at its peak garnered 25 sales in a single day. brinkman, from new orleans, said she is donating half of the proceeds to reproductive healthcare provider planned parenthood, which trump opposes because it offers abortions. “i thought it only made sense to use his own words to sell a product that would then benefit planned parenthood,” brinkman said. in past elections, jain said, her company had seen a direct link between the most merchandise sold and the candidate that won the election. “typically, whoever is winning in the sales column will win the election,” jain said. “right now, we’re seeing clinton winning the election.” ",0

" the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation would spin off its flagship health project into a “completely independent” charity if hillary clinton were to win the u.s. presidency in november, the charity announced on wednesday. the clinton health access initiative, which has focused on reducing the cost of hiv medicine in sub saharan africa, currently accounts for about two thirds of the foundation’s annual income and expenses, according to disclosures online.  the promise to carve it out of the foundation aims to quash concerns that donors might try to seek special access in a clinton white house.  bill and chelsea clinton, hillary clinton’s husband and daughter, would step down from the health project’s board and the project would no longer use the clinton name and instead would go by its acronym, chai, if the family returned to the white house next year, the announcement said. clinton has defended her family’s philanthropic organizations against accusations by donald trump, her republican rival, and others that wealthy donors, abroad and at home, might expect favorable treatment from the u.s. government. she has said no donor ever received inappropriate favors, but her staff have said she recognizes reorganization would be necessary to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interests.  on tuesday, new york state attorney general eric schneiderman said his office had opened an inquiry into the donald j. trump foundation to ensure the republican presidential nominee’s charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. the inquiry followed reports by the washington post regarding trump’s foundation and his contributions to the charity. he has refused to release his tax returns, which would show charitable giving. long time clinton associates bruce lindsey, ira magaziner and maggie williams would also step down from chai’s board, and the remaining board members would replace all five in consultation with global health experts, the charity said.  magaziner, who has been friends with bill clinton since they were students at oxford university, would remain as the project’s chief executive. the board would draft a “succession plan” by the end of the year, the announcement said. “if secretary clinton is elected president, the changes outlined here will be implemented and chai would become an organization completely independent of the clinton foundation,” the statement said. bill clinton set up the foundation as he prepared to leave the white house in 2001. hillary clinton joined its board after  leaving the u.s. state department in 2013 but stepped down last year to seek the presidency.  the foundation announced last month that it would no longer accept donations from foreigners or corporations for its other work besides chai, and said it would close overseas fundraising arms in sweden and the united kingdom.

" negotiators from rival palestinian factions fatah and islamist group hamas will discuss security in the gaza strip at unity talks in cairo on tuesday, including a proposal that would see fatah security personnel deployed to hamas dominated territory. the plan for 3,000 fatah security officers to join a gaza police force over the course of a year, part of a unity deal mediated by egypt in 2011, would restore much of the influence of fatah leader president mahmoud abbas in gaza and further loosen hamas  grip. the deal was never implemented. the western backed mainstream fatah party lost control of the enclave to hamas, considered a terrorist group by the west and israel, in fighting in 2007. the loss damaged abbas  credibility in the eyes of the west and israel, after years of being their main palestinian diplomatic counterpart. but under egypt s mediation, major steps have been made toward narrowing rifts since hamas handed administrative powers in gaza to a fatah backed government last month. the move was a major reversal for hamas and was partially prompted by the group s fears of potential financial and political isolation after its main donor qatar suffered a major diplomatic crisis with key allies.  the sides will discuss the security issue, especially in gaza, in the way that serves the home front, enforces the rule of law in a professional and national way and is not factional,  said hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum. under the deal, hamas would still have the most powerful armed palestinian faction, whose estimated 25,000 well equipped fighters have fought three wars with israel since 2008.  the issue of arms of resistance is not up for discussion,  hamas official sami abu zuhri told reuters. israel s enmity with hamas means greater unity with fatah is unlikely to help any future efforts for a peace deal with israel. but both sides hope that the deal s proposed deployment of security personnel from the fatah led palestinian authority to gaza s borders will encourage egypt and israel to ease their tight restrictions at border crossings, a badly needed step to help gaza revive its economy and improve the living standards of its two million residents.  officials said that apart from the implementation of the 2011 agreement and security, the cairo talks would also cover issues such as setting a date for presidential and legislative elections and reforming the palestine liberation organization, which is in charge of long stalled peace efforts with israel.  what happened in the past days is something like a declaration of principles while the two sides have postponed final status issues to the talks in cairo,  said gaza political analyst akram attallah. abbas has pledged there would be  one authority, one law, one administration, one weapon  in the gaza strip, a statement seeming to challenge hamas  continued security dominance. but tayseer nasrallah, a member of the fatah revolutionary council, told reuters:  there are difficult challenges and it will take time to overcome them. outstanding issues include the fate of 40,000 to 50,000 employees hired by hamas over the past 10 years and its demand abbas lift economic sanctions he imposed in recent months to try to pressure the group to compromise.

" a hindu man in india tried to raise money for a campaign against minority muslims by issuing an appeal for donations with a video he took and posted online showing him killing a muslim, police said on thursday. the killing last week is the latest to roil india s minority muslims who have faced attacks from mobs who accuse them of killing cows, which hindus consider sacred. hindu fringe groups also campaign against muslim men marrying hindus. the hindu man, shambu lal regar, has been arrested on suspicion of hacking and burning a muslim laborer in the western state of rajasthan, police said. regar had posted a video of the attack along with his bank details for donations to finance his anti muslim campaign, police officer anand shrivastava said. more than 700 people from across india deposited 300,000  rupees ($4,665) into the account.  the accused wanted to become a hindu hero after killing a muslim man, his main aim was to collect money after committing the hate crime,  said shrivastava. regar s video went viral on social media before authorities took it down. police investigators had frozen the bank account and were tracking down donors, shrivastava said. shrivastava said the video had showed regar claiming to be a proud hindu trying to stop  love jihad    a term used by hindu hardliners who accuse muslim men of entrapping hindu women and girls on the pretext of love in order to convert them to islam. the government of prime minister narendra modi, who leads the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party, has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop attacks on muslims. the government rejects that. modi has condemned violence in the name of protecting cows. muslims account for 172 million of india s 1.32 billion citizens and modi s critics say hindu groups linked with his ruling party are trying to marginalize them. the bjp denies any bias against muslims  ",0
" germany is best suited to host a new nato military logistics command, the top u.s. army general in europe said on tuesday. nato allies this month backed plans for two new military headquarters   an atlantic command and a logistics command   to help protect europe in the event of a future conflict. lieutenant general ben hodges told the berlin security conference that germany   already host to many u.s. troops   was well placed to take on the logistics role given its geographical location in the heart of europe, and its existing capabilities.  i can t imagine any other country being better suited than germany to take on that responsibility, from a geographical standpoint, a capability standpoint,  hodges said. diplomats have said that germany is eager to host the logistics command but no decisions have been made. hodges, who is due to retire next month, has repeatedly pushed for increased focus on improving the ability to move troops and equipment across europe in the event of a future conflict. nato began beefing up its defenses after the 2014 annexation by russia of ukraine s crimea peninsula, deploying troops to the baltic states and poland, strengthening its presence in the black sea and starting to modernizing its forces. the kremlin, which denies harboring any aggressive intentions toward europe, has condemned the moves as an attempt to encircle russia.

" the u.s. government, acknowledging its limited success in combating islamic extremist messaging, is recruiting tech companies, community organizations and educational groups to take the lead in disrupting online radicalization. the change in strategy, which took a step forward on wednesday when the justice department convened a meeting with social media firms including facebook inc, twitter and alphabet inc’s google , comes despite what critics say is scant evidence on the effectiveness of such efforts. the meeting was “a recognition that the government is ill positioned and ill equipped to counter isis online,” seamus hughes, deputy director of george washington university’s program on extremism, said after attending the event, using an acronym for the islamic state group. the federal government is not best placed to counter extremist online recruitment efforts with messaging of its own, said george selim, director of the department of homeland security (dhs) office that coordinates the government’s “countering violent extremism” (cve) activities.  the goal now, he said, is to help “communities and young people to amplify their own messages.” those messages stem from so called “counter narrative” programs underway at schools and community groups that have varying degrees of government support, according to government officials and private sector experts.   past campaigns by the administration of u.s. president barack obama to thwart extremist propaganda globally were widely regarded as too reliant on fear based rhetoric and graphic imagery to be effective.  but whether the new joint effort with the private sector will fare better remains unclear, say experts in countering extremism.  the obama administration has had an uneasy relationship with silicon valley in recent years. twitter and other tech firms have been reticent to appear too cozy with authorities on how they manage their content, though most have cautiously drifted toward being more compliant over the past year.   facebook last year partnered with british research group demos to examine the impact of “counter messaging” against hate speech in four european countries. the study, released in october, concluded it was “extremely difficult to calculate with any degree of precision” whether such efforts have a real impact on long term attitudes or offline behavior. “you don’t necessarily know if something is going to change the way someone thinks offline, but we can measure whether somebody shares that content or interacts with it,” monica bickert, facebook’s head of global policy management, told reuters. one of the new programs, funded partly by facebook and multiple government agencies, underwrites “peer to peer” (p2p) college courses that teach students to create their own anti militant messaging.  facebook declined to say how much it was investing in the program, though selim described facebook’s overall investment in cve initiatives as “very significant.” fatemah yousef, a student at kuwait gulf university for science and technology student, flew to washington this month to join a facebook event showcasing counter messaging projects created by students. yousef, 23, exhibited a blog that encourages kuwaiti students to denounce violent extremism on social media. another p2p finalist, a group from the university of arkansas, produced a video showing graphic islamic state executions set to heavy metal band black sabbath’s “war pigs.” half way through, the video switched to bob dylan’s “the times they are a changin’” as captions urged viewers to “raise a flag” against extremism. after viewing the video, a judge in the contest told the students that “probably about 90 to 95 percent” of the images in the video had been used in violent extremist recruitment videos. “we’ve had this problem in other places where people try to instill fear in target audiences by showing all this mayhem, but it actually does the reverse with some,” said the judge, quintan wiktorowicz, a former white house director for community partnerships. another effort is underway at worde, a muslim educational organization in maryland, which last week launched a campaign that aims to refute islamic state messages through catchy videos and live broadcasts of discussions about mainstream islam.  worde plans to use software or survey questions to gauge the impact of its new counter messaging campaign, said hedieh mirahmadi, the group’s president. “everybody creates stuff but doesn’t really care about whether it’s connected to the science of evaluations,” mirahmadi told reuters.  democratic new jersey senator cory booker told reuters that he is working on two bills — one of which has already passed committee in the senate — that would give dhs the authority to fund more college classes and research on how to best counter islamic state’s slick propaganda campaigns. “government messages do not prove to have that type of virality,” booker said. the p2p program is the only private sector counter messaging initiative that acknowledges receiving training from the federal bureau of investigation, but a senior fbi official said the agency provides information to other non governmental groups whose cve related work may include counter messaging. some efforts avoid federal funding altogether.  mohamed magid, a virginia imam who has counseled several youth targeted by islamic state recruiters, leads an islamic foundation soliciting donations to create a 24/7 online operation that would answer each islamic state video with peaceful messages.  “if we say this is a government thing, it might not have legitimacy,” magid said. “we’re challenging the muslim community to say, on this, yourself, respond to the challenge.”

" saudi arabian banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom as part of the government s anti corruption purge, bankers and lawyers said on tuesday. they added that the number is continuing to rise. dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain. since sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. the banker did not name the companies affected but said they included listed and unlisted firms across many sectors. he added that if the freezes stayed in place for long, they could start to hurt day to day business activities such as paying staff and creditors or making other transactions. a second banker said, however, that most of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals rather than companies, and that banks were being allowed by the regulator to continue to fund existing commitments. a central bank spokesman was not available to comment. among top business executives detained in the probe are billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal, chairman of investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se; nasser bin aqeel al tayyar, founder of al tayyar travel 1810.se; and amr al dabbagh, chairman of builder red sea international 4230.se. the stocks of all three companies, which have issued statements saying they continue to operate as normal, plunged between 9 and 10 percent on tuesday. one of the bankers speaking to reuters said the central bank had met with some foreign banks this week to reassure them that the freezing of accounts targeted individuals, and that firms linked to those people would not be damaged.

" a truck carrying relief supplies for rohingya muslim refugees  skidded off a hilly road in bangladesh and plunged into a paddy field on thursday, killing nine people and injuring 10, police and aid workers said. the accident happened in a district near the myanmar border where refugees have been arriving since late last month to escape a myanmar military offensive against insurgents that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing.  six died on the spot while three died on the way to hospital,  a. k. m. jahangir, a senior official with the red crescent relief group, told reuters. some of the injured were in critical condition, he added. the dead and injured were laborers, traveling in the truck to help distribute the aid supplies. about 422,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered the myanmar army offensive in response. buddhist majority myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces are tackling rohingya terrorists.

" burundi said on friday it will refuse to cooperate with an international criminal court (icc) investigation into war crimes  prosecutors suspect were committed by forces loyal to president pierre nkurunziza s government against their political opponents. the court ordered a formal investigation on thursday into crimes committed between april 2015 to october 2017. but experts say it will be hard for icc prosecutor fatou bensouda to gather evidence without support from burundi s government, which last month became the first to withdraw from the hague based court amid waning support from african nations. an earlier icc case in kenya fell apart due to opposition from the government of president uhuru kenyatta. like burundi, kenya and south africa have threatened to withdraw from the court, arguing that it disproportionately targets africans.    the government rejects that decision (to investigate) and reiterates its firm determination that it will not cooperate,  said burundi s justice minister aimee laurentine kanyana.   unrest has gripped burundi since nkurunziza said in april 2015 he would seek a third term in office, triggering protests and a crackdown by security forces. he won re election that july but opponents boycotted the vote, saying his decision to stand violated the constitution and the terms of a peace agreement that had ended a war in the central african country. the icc says that under international law it still has jurisdiction over crimes committed while burundi was a member.    judges said bensouda should investigate whether crimes against humanity were committed including murder, torture, rape and persecution. government forces are suspected to have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 400,000 during the crackdown. human rights groups say the number killed could be far higher. human rights groups and opposition politicians in burundi welcomed the court s decision. charles nditije, the exiled head of burundi s opposition platform cnared, called the move  a victory for justice .... for those who want the return of peace and rule of law to burundi.  armel niyongere, a burundian lawyer representing families of the victims, said he would assist bensouda s investigation.  legal experts said bensouda may be unable to bring any suspects to the hague as long as nkurunziza remains in power.  i suspect that it will be very challenging for the icc to access ... evidence in burundi  said berlin based international criminal justice lawyer angela mudukuti. bensouda s decision was courageous and she will likely seek to use evidence obtained by interviewing refugees who have fled to neighboring tanzania and rwanda, said karine bonneau, a senior official at the paris based international federation for human rights.  she had very little choice but to open an investigation given the gravity of the crimes,  she said. others said the prosecution was largely symbolic. bensouda s job is in part to deter future crimes, said thijs bouwknegt, an africa expert at the netherlands  institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies.  if she acts like some super human rights watchdog and names and shames people i think this may be effective,  he said.

" japan has detected radio signals suggesting north korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals are not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity, a japanese government source said on tuesday. after firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since april, north korean missile launches paused in september, after it fired a rocket that passed over japan s northern hokkaido island.  this is not enough to determine (if a launch is likely soon),  the source told reuters. japan s kyodo news agency reported late on monday that the japanese government was on alert after catching such radio signals, suggesting a launch could come in a few days. the report also said the signals might be related to winter military training by the north korean military. north korea is pursuing its nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of u.n. security council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. it has fired two missiles over japan. south korea s yonhap news agency, citing a south korean government source, also reported that intelligence officials of the united states, south korea and japan had recently detected signs of a possible missile launch and have been on higher alert. south korean unification minister cho myoung gyon told reporters on tuesday there have been  noteworthy  movements from the north since its last missile launch in mid september, but there was no hard evidence of another nuclear or missile test.  north korea hasn t been engaging in new nuclear or missile tests but recently we ve seen them persistently testing engines and carrying out fuel tests,  said cho at a media event in seoul.  but we need some more time to see whether these are directly related to missile and nuclear tests.  asked about the media reports, pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning told reporters the united states continued to watch north korea very closely.   this is a diplomatically led effort at this point, supported by military options,  he said.  the republic of korea and u.s. alliance remains strong and capable of countering any north korean provocations or attacks.  two u.s. government sources familiar with official assessments of north korean capabilities and activities said that while they were not immediately familiar with recent intelligence suggesting that north korea was preparing to launch a new missile test, the u.s. government would not be surprised if such a test were to take place in the very near future. other u.s. intelligence officials noted north korea has previously sent deliberately misleading signs of preparations for missile and nuclear tests, in part to mask real preparations, and in part to test u.s. and allied intelligence on its activities. south korea s cho said north korea may announce the completion of its nuclear programme within a year, as it is moving more faster than expected in developing its arsenal. north korea defends its weapons programmes as a necessary defence against u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which stations 28,500 troops in south korea, a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, denies any such intention.

" jacob zuma s spokesman said on friday there was no basis for reports that the south african president would axe his deputy cyril ramaphosa, speculation about which has weighed on the currency and bonds. the ruling african national congress (anc) party, of which zuma is leader and ramaphosa deputy, has been riven by bitter infighting ahead of a party conference in december at which a new leader will be chosen.      it s rumors and gossip, and we don t comment on them at all,  zuma s spokesman bongani ngqulunga told reuters. ramaphosa, a trade unionist turned business tycoon, is viewed as the most likely rival candidate to nkosazana dlamini zuma, the former chairwoman of the african union, who is zuma s pick for the leadership and is the president s ex wife.  he has recently stepped up criticism of zuma s scandal plagued government. asked in parliament on thursday whether he might be sacked, ramaphosa said only that he would accept the president s decision if he lost his job. on friday, a spokesman for the deputy president said:  we are aware of the speculation, but it is just speculation.      trade union federation cosatu and the south african communist party (sacp), both partners in the anc s ruling alliance, have endorsed ramaphosa, 64, for the leadership. south africa will elect a new president in 2019, and whoever the anc picks in december is likely to take over from 75 year old zuma as the country s leader. zuma is under pressure to step down before then, with a recent south african court ruling that nearly 800 corruption charges against him should be reinstated prompting more calls for the president to go. zuma reshuffled his cabinet for the second time in seven months on tuesday, irking some within the ruling alliance by sacking a minister belonging to the sacp and appointing a close ally to oversee an opaque nuclear deal.  analysts say zuma may make further changes before december to strengthen his hand going into the anc s elective conference. speculation that he might remove ramaphosa, who was the anc s chief negotiator during the 1990s transition from apartheid, weighed on the rand and bonds, which underperformed emerging market peers on friday versus a firmer dollar.  other emerging markets are weaker but not as much as the rand. that s because of lingering political uncertainty, especially these rumors about zuma axing ramaphosa,  said currency dealer at treasuryone wichard cilliers. ramaphosa told parliament on thursday that  if (zuma s) decision is to remove me, i will accept that as a decision that will be taken by the president and i will continue serving the people of south africa in one form, shape or another . speaking on friday, ramaphosa returned to the subject of corruption within the government and state owned companies, which is expected to be a main theme of his leadership campaign.   our state has been captured by people who ... want to milk the state, who want to rob our country of the money that belongs to the people,  ramaphosa told members of the national education health & allied workers  union (nehawu) in cape town.     our state is now being talked about in the rest of the world in the most negative terms, captured by certain interests, by certain families, by certain individuals.  wealthy friends of zuma, the guptas, have been accused by anc and opposition politicians of using their close relationship with the president and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  zuma and the guptas have denied any wrongdoing and the indian born south african businessmen and their companies have not been charged with any crime in south africa.  regulators in the united states and britain are looking into links between the gupta family, the south african government, and banks they may have used to move money as a corruption investigation escalates. in a statement on friday, dlamini zuma denied she had any links to the gupta family.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions refused to answer questions on thursday during a closed congressional hearing about whether president donald trump ever instructed him to hinder the justice department’s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election, according to democratic lawmakers who attended. sessions testified behind closed doors for several hours   before the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee. representative adam schiff, the committee’s top democrat, told reporters he was troubled by sessions’ refusal to answer what he believes are essential questions. “i asked the attorney general whether he was ever instructed by the president to take any action that he believed would hinder the russia investigation and he declined to answer the question,” schiff told reporters after the hearing. “there is no privileged basis to decline to answer a question like that. if the president did not instruct him to take an action that would hinder the investigation, he should say so. if the president did instruct him to hinder the investigation in any way, in my view that would be a potential criminal act,” schiff said. representative mike quigley, another democratic committee member, said on msnbc that sessions “is one of the most forgetful persons who works out of washington, d.c., or he’s being less than candid with the american public.” sessions declined to comment to reporters as he left the secure hearing room.  the panel is among several congressional committees, along with the justice department’s special counsel robert mueller, investigating allegations that russia sought to influence the  u.s. election and potential collusion by trump’s campaign. moscow has denied any meddling and trump has said there was no collusion. another source familiar with his testimony said that sessions said he could not remember the answers to many important questions, and the answers he did provide concerning meetings with russians tracked statements he had previously made in other congressional hearings. a spokeswoman for sessions said he has consistently declined to discuss his communications with trump in the past, and that he has also previously said he was never instructed to do anything illegal or improper.  when he was a republican u.s. senator, sessions was an early supporter and close adviser to trump during his run for the white house. democrats have accused sessions of repeatedly changing his sworn testimony throughout several prior congressional hearings about meetings and contacts between the trump campaign and russian officials. schiff said committee members asked sessions questions during the closed hearing about his prior testimony and about “interactions the campaign had with russia.” the intelligence committee also met for more than three hours on thursday with erik prince, who founded the private military contractor blackwater and was a supporter of trump’s presidential campaign. one focus of thursday’s interview was expected to be a meeting prince had in the seychelles islands in january, which some news reports later described as an effort to connect the incoming trump administration with moscow. prince’s sister, betsy devos, is trump’s secretary of education, and he has said the seychelles meeting had nothing to do with trump. schiff told reporters there were some “unresolved issues” after prince’s testimony. prince complained that the hearing had wasted time and taxpayer dollars on a “meaningless fishing expedition.” a spokesman for prince later issued a statement saying prince had volunteered to answer questions. “as we have said throughout, mr. prince has never acted on behalf of president trump, the transition team or his administration regarding russia.” the republican led committee is planning to publicly release the transcript of prince’s closed hearing, described as “public in a closed setting” within about three days. there is no plan to release a transcript from sessions’ testimony.

" canadian prime minister justin trudeau said on thursday he had urged u.s. president donald trump not to withdraw from the north american free trade agreement because it would cause a lot of pain on both sides of the border. the white house said earlier that trump told the leaders of canada and mexico in separate calls on wednesday that he would not terminate the nafta treaty at this stage, but would move quickly to begin renegotiating it with them. trump, who says nafta has been a disaster for american workers, has threatened several times to walk away from the three nation pact unless major changes are made. mexico is the third member. “he (said on the call) he was very much thinking about canceling and i highlighted quite frankly ... that a disruption like canceling nafta, even if it theoretically eventually might lead to better outcomes, would cause a lot of short and medium term pain,” said trudeau. “that’s not something that either one of us would want so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve nafta,” trudeau told a televised news conference in gray, saskatchewan. any move to break up nafta would cause great economic damage to canada, which sends 75 percent of all its exports to the united states. trump’s administration has yet to formally advise the u.s. congress of its intention to open negotiations. a canadian source familiar with the matter said trudeau had added in his comments to trump that pulling out of nafta would be counter productive. canadian officials have so far taken a largely restrained attitude to trump’s harsh language on nafta, describing it as a negotiating tactic ahead of the talks. that said, government ministers have made clear canada could slap sanctions on the united states if it decided to impose protectionist measures such as a border tariff. trudeau, asked about possible trade retaliation, said canada preferred to work with the united states constructively but added: “there’s no question there’s a broad range of options and paths available to us that we’re looking at.” he did not give details but the trump administration on monday moved to impose tariffs on imported canadian lumber that mostly feeds u.s. homebuilding.

" seoul and beijing on tuesday agreed to move beyond a year long stand off over the deployment of a u.s. anti missile system in south korea, a dispute that has been devastating to south korean businesses that rely on chinese consumers. the unexpected detente comes just days before u.s. president donald trump begins a trip to asia, where the north korean nuclear crisis will take center stage, and helped propel south korean stocks to a record high. the installation of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system had angered china, with south korea s tourism, cosmetics and entertainment industries bearing the brunt of a chinese backlash, although beijing has never specifically linked that to the thaad deployment. beijing worries the thaad system s powerful radar can penetrate into chinese territory.  both sides shared the view that the strengthening of exchange and cooperation between korea and china serves their common interests and agreed to expeditiously bring exchange and cooperation in all areas back on a normal development track,  south korea s foreign ministry said in a statement. before the thaad dispute, bilateral relations flourished,  despite beijing s historic alliance with north korea and seoul s close ties with washington, which includes hosting 28,500 u.s. troops. china is south korea s biggest trading partner.  at this critical moment all stakeholders should be working together to address the north korea nuclear challenge instead of creating problems for others,  said wang dong, associate professor of international studies at china s peking university.  this sends a very positive signal that beijing and seoul are determined to improve their relations.  as part of the agreement, south korean president moon jae in will meet chinese president xi jinping on the sidelines of the summit of asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) countries in vietnam on nov. 10 11. south korea recognized china s concerns over thaad and made it clear the deployment was not aimed at any third country and did not harm china s strategic security interests, china s foreign ministry said. china reiterated its opposition to the deployment of thaad, but noted south korea s position and hoped south korea could appropriately handle the issue, it added.  china s position on the thaad issue is clear, consistent and has not changed,  chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a daily briefing in beijing. the thaw is a big relief for south korean tourism and retail firms as well as k pop stars and makers of films and soap operas, which had found themselves unofficially unwelcome in china over the past year. in south korea, a halving of inbound chinese tourists in the first nine months of the year cost the economy $6.5 billion in lost revenue based on the average spending of chinese visitors in 2016, data from the korea tourism organization shows. the spat knocked about 0.4 percentage points off this year s expected economic growth, according to the bank of korea, which now forecasts an expansion of 3 percent. the sprawling lotte group, which provided the land where the thaad battery was installed and is a major operator of hotels and duty free stores, has been hardest hit. it faces a costly overhaul and is expected to sell its chinese hypermarket stores for a fraction of what it invested. a spokesman for holding company lotte corp expressed hope that south korean firms  activity in china would improve following the announcement. an official at seoul s presidential blue house, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter, said improvements for south korean companies would come slowly. shares in south korean tourism and retail companies rallied nonetheless, with asiana airlines gaining 3.6 percent and lotte shopping up 7.14 percent. the benchmark kospi index hit a record for a third straight day, gaining 0.9 percent. china has grown increasingly angry with north korea s ongoing pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of united nations sanctions, even as it chafes at u.s. pressure to rein in its isolated ally. the recent deterioration in ties between china and north korea may have contributed to tuesday s agreement, the blue house official said. pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing program in recent months, as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early september, as it seeks to develop a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states. the head of nato on tuesday urged all united nations members to fully and transparently implement sanctions against north korea.  north korea s ballistic and nuclear tests are an affront to the united nations security council,  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said in tokyo, where he met japanese prime minister shinzo abe. separately, a south korean lawmaker said north korea probably stole south korean warship blueprints after hacking into a local shipbuilder s database last april. expectations had been growing for a warming in the frosty bilateral ties following this month s conclave of china s communist party, during which xi cemented his status as china s most powerful leader after mao zedong. earlier this month, south korea and china agreed to renew a $56 billion currency swap agreement, while chinese airlines are reportedly planning to restore flight routes to south korea that had been cut during the spat. tuesday s agreement came after high level talks led by nam gwan pyo, deputy director of national security of the

" the pace of approvals for nuclear reactor restarts in japan, where most plants remain shut following the fukushima disaster, is unlikely to pick up in the coming years, the new head of japan s nuclear regulator said in an interview on tuesday. the comments from nuclear regulation authority (nra) chairman toyoshi fuketa suggest japan may not make headway in meeting its electricity generation targets. by 2030, the country was expecting nuclear to power about one fifth of its generation. however, utilities are having difficulty grappling with tougher rules on protecting reactors from natural disasters in the earthquake prone country. following the fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, the world s worst since chernobyl in 1986, the nra was set up in 2012 to draft new safety standards that have been described as among the world s toughest. since then, 12 reactors at six nuclear plants have passed the safety requirements needed to restart, but only four reactors are currently operating. one more reactor that resumed operations after meeting the requirements has been shut down for scheduled maintenance.  most of the approvals have been for reactors in western japan and not on the east coast where tokyo electric power co s fukushima daiichi station was located. the plant suffered multiple reactor meltdowns after an earthquake on the northeast coast caused a tsunami that swamped the site.  we have accumulated experience in safety reviews, but comparatively speaking, many of the plants in eastern japan that we are reviewing now have difficult natural conditions,  fuketa, 60, said in the interview.  it s doubtful the pace of approvals would quicken.  a majority of japanese oppose nuclear power after fukushima and restarts are a delicate political issue rather than just a matter of meeting technical safety requirements. when asked if he could place a number of how many reactors may be approved for a resumption of operations in the next five years, fuketa said:  i honestly do not know.  about a dozen other reactors are going through safety checks as part of a relicensing process under the new rules. fuketa is known for taking tough positions during safety reviews of reactors and has been instrumental in directing the clean up of the wrecked fukushima plant. japan s government set an energy mix plan in 2015 that forecasts relying on nuclear power to generate between 20 to 22 percent of the country s electricity in 2030. that requires having about 30 reactors operating by then. japan s nine regional power utilities and a wholesaler, japan atomic power co, have 42 nuclear reactors for commercial use, with a total generating capacity of 41,482 megawatts.

" the united states on wednesday called the myanmar military operation against the rohingya population  ethnic cleansing  and  threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for what it called  horrendous atrocities.   the situation in northern rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against the rohingya,  u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said in a statement, using a term he avoided when visiting myanmar, also known as burma, last week.  the united states will also pursue accountability through u.s. law, including possible targeted sanctions  against those responsible for the alleged abuses, which have driven hundreds of thousands of rohingya into neighboring bangladesh, he said. the united states shifted its stance in part to raise pressure on myanmar s military and civilian leaders, who have shared power for the past two years under an uneasy arrangement after decades of military rule, to address the crisis. rights monitors accused myanmar s military of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson, against the stateless rohingya during so called clearance operations after rohingya militants  aug. 25 attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled rakhine state in buddhist majority myanmar, mostly to neighboring bangladesh, since the crackdown, which followed the insurgent attacks.      these abuses by some among the burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes have caused tremendous suffering and forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to flee their homes,  tillerson said. while repeating u.s. condemnation of the insurgent attacks, he added:  no provocation can justify the horrendous atrocities that have ensued.  myanmar s 2 year old government, led by nobel peace prize laureate aung san suu kyi, has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals with whom it shares power.  it s not a situation that is completely under her authority, but certainly we are counting on her to show leadership and also to work through the civilian government with the military to address the crisis,  a senior u.s. official told reporters in a conference call. the term  ethnic cleansing  is not defined in international or u.s. law and does not inherently carry specific consequences, a second senior u.s. official said on the call. murray hiebert, a southeast asia analyst with the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington, said the state department s use of the term and threat of sanctions  will likely have limited to no impact on the ground.   it is likely to create more distrust between the united states and myanmar s military and government and push them closer to china, russia, and its more authoritarian neighbors in southeast asia,  he added.  the u.s. move came the same day as a u.n. tribunal convicted former bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for massacres of bosnian muslims and ethnic cleansing campaigns, and imprisoned him for life. the second u.s. official said washington was analyzing whether genocide or crimes against humanity had occurred in myanmar, which would violate international law, but has made no determination on either and that this would take time to assess.  in the end it s a court that has to decide that, as we ve just seen with the verdict against mladic,  he said. a top u.n. official in september described the military actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing,  but the united states until wednesday had avoided the term.  washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian government in myanmar, where it competes for influence with china, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses. u.s. officials also worry that the mistreatment of the rohingya muslim minority may fuel radicalism. the first u.s. official said washington would work with bangladesh and myanmar to encourage the voluntary repatriation of rohingya.  we have focused on the issue of voluntary returns,  the official said.  we don t want people to be forced to return to a situation in which they feel uncomfortable.   congressional pressure for a tougher u.s. response to the rohingya crisis mounted before president donald trump s first visit to asia this month to attend a summit of southeast asian countries, including myanmar, in manila. u.s. government sources told reuters in october that officials were preparing a recommendation for tillerson that would define the military led campaign against the rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions. in early november, u.s. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials. rights group amnesty international called for a comprehensive arms embargo against myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior myanmar military officials.

" at a town hall in his conservative florida district this week, u.s. representative ted yoho drew applause for defying his own republican party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was president donald trump’s first major legislative initiative. far from paying a price back home, as trump has threatened they would, yoho and some of the other far right members of the house freedom caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two week congressional recess. a handful of house freedom caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month’s defeat of trump’s effort to repeal and replace obamacare, which was also rejected by some republican moderates. many supporters made clear they expect them to work with trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation’s health care system. “i want it done,” said bob white, 74, after questioning yoho on the issue during a town hall on tuesday night in rural putnam county, florida. “wield that big stick.”  the rebellious faction of conservatives in the house of representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by trump to rewrite obamacare, president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. trump has singled out the group for blame. many caucus members refused to back the republican leadership’s bill because they considered parts too similar to obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. at town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs. the reception for yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of congress, said matthew green, an associate professor of politics at catholic university of america, who studies congressional parties and leaders. “the freedom caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents ‘good job,’” he said. “or if they don’t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.” michigan representative justin amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a white house adviser called on twitter for trump supporters to defeat him in a primary. but in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker kellogg co, the four term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in battle creek, michigan on tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending. “if i had to choose between justin and trump, i’d go with justin for sure,” said construction worker eric smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found trump lacking conservative principles. “at this point, i’d give donald trump a d.”  retiree cliff ward, 72, told amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions. “now we need you to work with trump and the other republicans to get this done,” he added.     living in georgetown, florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, trump voter melvin shebester knew little about the house freedom caucus. the faction of small government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream republican leadership in the house, including an attempt to push out former republican house speaker john boehner. the 84 year old shebester was impressed that his congressman, yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed. “it takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,” said shebester, attending yoho’s town hall on tuesday night at a government center in palatka, florida with his son and grandson. “we can’t go up there and tell trump he’s wrong,” added his son, steven shebester, 56, who lives nearby.      many republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.  but yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. his event in gainesville, a college town, on monday was crowded by left leaning activists who at times shouted him down. on tuesday night in palatka, a small town in yoho’s sprawling district in north central florida lined with oaks and spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd. he told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. and a phone survey of constituents found the republican plan was as unpopular as obamacare itself. he said constituents gave him a clear message: “stay the course.” (this version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph) ",0

" the prospect of running for re election with donald trump at the top of the republican ticket was worrying some party lawmakers as they huddled for an annual retreat, where a few forecast trouble if trump becomes the party’s presidential nominee. “heaven help us,” representative peter roskam said when asked about it by a reporter. but the illinois republican quickly added, “i’m not going to comment on the presidential candidates at this point.” that reticence was shared by many lawmakers asked about running on trump’s coattails during an event in baltimore where senate and house of representatives republicans gathered to talk through their priorities for a coming year whose highlight is the november election. some were not reluctant to express concerns. trump would not help republicans if he topped the ticket, despite his appeal to americans fed up with politicians, said representative justin amash, a favorite of the conservative tea party movement who has endorsed kentucky republican senator rand paul for president. “he does appeal to the anger,” amash said of trump, the outspoken real estate mogul who is front runner to be the party’s presidential nominee. but he said trump’s “policy prescriptions will take us in the wrong direction, and it won’t be long before many of those people are angry at him and angry at republicans again.” the idea of trump capturing the republican nomination seemed highly unlikely just months ago, but it was sinking in as an actual possibility this week across the republican party. in addition to voting for a new president, americans will elect members of the senate and the house on nov. 8. in u.s. politics, a party’s presidential nominee has a big impact on  the campaigns of candidates for both chambers of congress. at the party gathering, republican leaders were keen to talk policy, not presidential politics. “what happens above us on the presidential ballot, you really don’t control,” senator john thune, a senior party leader from south dakota, told reporters. house speaker paul ryan, of wisconsin, said: “we are not sitting here thinking about who the nominee is going to be. we don’t have time to think about that.” but in the hallways of the retreat, at a hotel on baltimore’s restored waterfront, trump was often the hot topic. he is leading national opinion polls ahead of the feb. 1 iowa caucus, the first step in the nominating process. representative jason chaffetz said it was important to have a presidential nominee who will not “embarrass” the rest of the party’s candidates as they defend the republican majorities in both congressional chambers. chaffetz, who is from utah, has endorsed marco rubio, a republican senator from florida. polls show rubio in third place behind trump and texas senator ted cruz in iowa. “marco rubio is not going to embarrass us ... he’s not as sensational in his comments as the others, but there’s a good quality to that, and i think that’s also something you look for in a president,” chaffetz said. among other proposals, trump has called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and a wall along the u.s. border with mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. representative tom cole said republicans’ fate will be linked closely to the republican nominee, whoever it is.  trump would be a wild card, said cole, of oklahoma. “i don’t know what he (trump) will do. i can see a situation where he could be a great asset, because i do think he will bring some people out (to vote) who have not been brought before.” representative peter king of new york agreed that trump is “more of a gamble” at the top of the ticket. “the conventional wisdom is that he would hurt more than he would help,” said king, who was unable to attend the retreat but spoke by telephone. “but on the other hand, he is tapping into something (among voters) out there.”  (editing by kevin drawbaugh, caren bohan and frances kerry) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" cambodian prime minister hun sen said on thursday he was suspending cooperation with the united states to find the remains of americans killed in the vietnam war in the latest ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries. hun sen has accused the united states of plotting treason with opposition leader kem sokha, an accusation rejected by the u.s. embassy, which has called for the release of the prime minister s main rival.  the search cooperation is postponed until a number of issues are resolved between cambodia and the united states,  hun sen said according to pro government website fresh news. hun sen said that a total of 80 american soldiers had gone missing in cambodia during the war in neighboring vietnam and that half of them had been found. hun sen said the suspension will be lifted after cambodia u.s. ties are restored. washington announced on wednesday that it would stop issuing some visas after cambodia refused to accept cambodian citizens deported from the united states after being convicted of crimes there. hun sen said the policy of deporting them back to cambodia  break them up as families, as parents and children, and it s an inhumane (situation) in which some have committed suicide . the vietnam war that ended in 1975 remains an emotive issue in cambodia.  hun sen says the united states has never apologized for its role in bombing his country to try to kill vietnamese communist guerrillas and should forgive debts built up by a pro u.s. junta that ruled until it was ousted by the genocidal khmer rouge. on a separate issue, cambodia s foreign affairs ministry said it would accept deportees from the united states. the u.s. embassy in phnom penh declined to comment.

" “the french never vote like the americans,” a politician told a rally for presidential favorite alain juppe on wednesday as france wondered if it would be the next country to prove the opinion polls wrong. juppe, mayor of the southwest city of bordeaux and a former prime minister, has topped the polls for months. surveys predict he will win both a primary later in november to be the center right’s candidate and the presidential election in six months. but after pollsters failed to predict u.s. voters would make donald trump their country’s 45th president, like their british colleagues who got the united kingdom’s vote to leave the eu wrong, france has started bracing for a possible surprise next year. “juppe is ahead in polls and he will also win. the french are not like the americans, we’re not crazy,” juppe supporter mbacoye balde, 35, told reuters at the bordeaux rally. nearby, another juppe supporter carried a banner reading “ne vous trumpez pas” a french play on words with trump’s name  that meant “don’t make a mistake.”  “we’ve always been cautious about polls, we’ve always said one should not get carried away and it was not in the bag,” virginie calmels, juppe’s deputy in bordeaux and one of his campaign spokespersons, said of his strong ratings.     but she added: “it’s not quite the same in france and in the united states.” unlike in the united states for the trump vote, pollsters in france have recently tended to overestimate support for the anti immigration national front (fn), she said. the far right party won no region in last year’s local elections, despite forecasts it would get at least one.  but its leader marine le pen is another strong candidate in the presidential election and is expected to be one of the two contestants to make it into the runoff round   possibly against juppe himself. juppe told the rally that, if elected, he would “obviously be available for dialogue with president trump” but spent much of his speech warning against populism, saying inclusiveness and hope were the answer.   juppe is campaigning on a moderate platform more to the center than the law and order strategy of main rival nicolas sarkozy, who was france’s president in 2007 2012 and has courted controversy with his hard line on immigration and islam. without mentioning sarkozy by name, juppe said: “beware the false answers and bad solutions ... i say ‘no’ to divisiveness, ‘no’ to demagoguery that pit the french against one another.”  “i want the optimistic france to lift up the sad france,” he said, just days ahead of the two round primary on november 20 and 27 where he will compete against sarkozy and five other candidates for the center right’s nomination.

" two u.s. senate democrats on tuesday called for government wide investigations into the trump administration’s use of secretive messaging phone applications and whether officials are ignoring or delaying responses to some congressional oversight requests. delaware senator tom carper and missouri senator claire mccaskill, both influential members of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, asked the inspectors general at 24 executive agencies and departments to investigate whether officials are using apps for work that make it hard to trace communications. the apps encrypt messages and automatically delete them after they are read, which could run afoul of laws on preserving government records, the senators wrote. while republicans control both the senate and the house of representatives, democrats in congress can still request that inspectors general, neutral investigators who check up on various federal offices, look into specific matters.  they also asked the inspectors general if officials in the administration of republican president donald trump are directing employees of government agencies to ignore requests for information from democrats in congress. members of both parties objected after the administration said agencies do not have to honor requests made by senior democrats on congressional committees. democrats and public interest groups are worried that the trump administration is hiding important information about possible wrongdoing and stonewalling potential critics. they are also worried about social media, where trump has tweeted and then later deleted posts. the office of the department of justice’s inspector general, michael horowitz, who also chairs the council of federal inspectors general, declined to comment on the letter.  the white house did not respond to a request for comment. the federal government has strict laws on preserving records, which can be used to uncover and prosecute public corruption and collusion. inspectors general themselves often rely on archived emails and text messages in investigations. since trump’s inauguration in january many washington insiders have embraced messaging apps that promptly destroy chats, encrypt texts and phone calls, and leave no trace of communication on smartphones. concerns about information security have grown in the wake of the hack of the democratic party’s emails, criticism of candidate hillary clinton’s use of a private server and laws that count communications from non government accounts as federal records. journalists and officials now frequently communicate via the encrypted signal or confide messenger apps. confide is so popular that the company hosted a media and technology event during this year’s white house correspondents dinner weekend.

" an islamic state evacuation convoy trying to reach is territory in east syria has split in two, with some buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government held areas, a u.s. led coalition fighting the group said on sunday.  the syrian government and lebanon s hezbollah group offered the convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and about 300 family members safe passage a week ago in return for islamic state surrendering an enclave on the syria lebanon border.  however, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering islamic state territory in east syria, near the border with iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges, saying it opposes the evacuation deal as being  not a lasting solution .   one group remains in the open desert to the north west of al bukamal and the other group has headed west towards palmyra,  the coalition said in an emailed statement. on saturday hezbollah said all but six of the buses had safely crossed out of syrian government territory and were no longer the responsibility of it or the syrian government. it warned the united states that the buses in the desert included elderly people, pregnant women and casualties, and accused it of stopping humanitarian aid reaching the convoy. the coalition said it had contacted russia to deliver a message to the syrian government that it would still not let the convoy pass, and that it had offered suggestions on how to save the civilians in it from suffering.   food and water have been provided to the convoy,  it said, without giving further details.  the coalition has said it will not target the convoy directly while it contains civilians, but said in its statement it had struck about 85 is fighters near the convoy.  it had also struck about 40 is vehicles near the convoy including a tank, an artillery system, armed vehicles and transport vehicles seeking to help move the fighters in the convoy into its territory, it said.

" the united states is encouraged by china’s efforts to restrain north korea but washington will not accept beijing’s militarization of islands in the south china sea, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on saturday. the comments by mattis, during the annual shangri la dialogue, show how u.s. president donald trump’s administration is looking to balance working with china to restrain north korea’s advancing missile and nuclear programs while dealing with beijing’s activities in the south china sea. u.s. allies have been worried by trump’s actively courting chinese president xi jinping to restrain north korea, fearing washington might allow china a more free rein elsewhere in the region. some allies have also expressed concern that washington’s withdrawal from the trans pacific trade partnership and the paris global climate accord signals the united states is diluting its global leadership role. speaking at the dialogue, asia’s premier security forum, mattis said the united states remained fully engaged with its partners.  “like it or not, we are a part of the world...what a crummy world if we all retreat inside our borders,” he said.  “once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the americans will do the right thing,” mattis added, paraphrasing a quotation by british wartime leader winston churchill. “so we will still be there and we will be there with you.” nevertheless, reversing or slowing north korea’s nuclear and missile programs has become a security priority for washington, given pyongyang’s vow to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. the trump administration has been pressing china aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor, warning all options are on the table if north korea persists with its weapons programs. “the trump administration is encouraged by china’s renewed commitment to work with the international community toward denuclearization,” mattis said.  “ultimately, we believe china will come to recognize north korea as a strategic liability, not an asset.” however, mattis said seeking china’s cooperation on north korea did not mean washington would not challenge beijing’s activities in the south china sea. the u.n. security council on friday expanded targeted sanctions against north korea after its repeated missile tests, adopting the first such resolution agreed by the united states and china since trump took office. in another sign of increased pressure on north korea, japan’s navy and air force began a three day military exercise with two u.s. aircraft carriers in the sea of japan on thursday. japanese defense minister tomomi inada, speaking at the singapore forum, said tokyo backed the united states using any option to deal with north korea, including military strikes, and was seeking a deeper alliance with washington. but she also said she was concerned about the situation in the south china sea and in the east china sea.    china’s claims in the south china sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes each year, are contested by brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam. china and japan both claim islands in the east china sea. low key china, which sent only a low key delegation to the forum,  said its ties with the united states were vital for the region. “i believe that if china and the united states can ensure no conflict, as well as maintain mutual respect, cooperation and trust, it will contribute greatly to security in the asia pacific and the world,” lt gen he lei, the head of beijing’s delegation, told reporters.     allies around the world have been concerned about the commitment of the united states since trump took office on jan. 20 because of his “america first” rhetoric and expectations that he would concentrate on a domestic agenda. “we are still trying to figure out his (trump’s) policy in our region,” said malaysian defense minister hishammuddin hussein. “i would like to know very clearly what are the true intentions of the new administration.”    mattis sought to ease concerns for allies in the asia pacific, saying the region was a priority and the primary effort was alliance building. he added, however, that countries must “contribute sufficiently to their own security.” in a sign of the u.s. commitment to the region, mattis said that soon about 60 percent of overseas tactical aviation assets would be assigned to the region and he would work with the u.s. congress on an asia pacific stability initiative. mattis said the united states welcomed china’s economic development, but he anticipated “friction” between the two countries. “while competition between the u.s. and china, the world’s two largest economies, is bound to occur, conflict is not inevitable,” mattis said.  while eager to work with china in dealing with north korea, mattis said the united states did not accept china placing weapons and other military assets on

" saudi arabia s king salman bin abdulaziz said on wednesday his government was determined to confront corruption with  justice and decisiveness , signalling continued support for a crackdown on sleaze involving mass arrests of top saudis including royals. in a televised speech to the country s consultative shura  council, salman also said the world s largest oil exporter will work to enable the private sector to become a partner in the kingdom s economic diversification drive away from petroleum. saudi security forces rounded up hundreds of members of the political and business elite, including princes and tycoons, in early november: riyadh said it was a crackdown on corruption but the move was also widely seen as helping crown prince mohammed bin salman tighten his grip on power. the purge has caused concern about damage to the economy, especially among foreign investors the kingdom is seeking to attract. but the government has insisted it is respecting due process and that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally. in a speech focused on economic issues, salman said the kingdom was pushing ahead with its  vision 2030  economic reform plan to find new sources of revenue for the opec powerhouse. but he said that corruption was one of the main threats to economic development.  we have decided, with god s help, to confront it (corruption) with justice and decisiveness so that our country can enjoy the renaissance and development that every citizen aspires for,  he said. signaling his support for the campaign of arrests, he said that he had ordered the formation of a higher committee against corruption headed by the crown prince.  thanks be to god that those are a few (people),  he said, referring to the number of arrestees. the public prosecutor said last week that most of those detained in the anti corruption campaign have agreed to settlements to avoid prosecution, while the rest could be held for months. salman said the restructuring the kingdom was undertaking did not contradict its islamic values, which he said were based on moderate islam.  there is no place among us for an extremist who sees moderation as deviation, or who would exploit our benevolent faith to achieve his goals,  he added. salman also reiterated saudi arabia s condemnation of president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and move the u.s. embassy to the city. in an apparent reference to arch foe iran, salman also said saudi arabia was working with its allies to confront any  tendency for external interference in the internal affairs and fan the flames of sectarian sedition, and undermine regional security and stability . he did not elaborate.

" zimbabwe s ruling party accused the head of the armed forces of treason on tuesday as troops took up positions around the capital in an escalation of a dispute with 93 year old president robert mugabe over political succession. just 24 hours after military chief general constantino chiwenga threatened to intervene to end a purge in the ruling party, a reuters reporter saw six armored personnel carriers on major thoroughfares on the outskirts of the capital. aggressive soldiers directing traffic told passing cars to keep moving through the darkness.  don t try anything funny. just go,  one soldier said on harare drive. the presence of troops, including the movement of at least six armored personnel carriers from a barracks northwest of harare, sparked rumors of coup against mugabe, although there was no evidence to suggest zimbabwe s leader of the last 37 years had been toppled. the lead item on the zbc state broadcaster s evening news bulletin was an anti military rally by the youth wing of mugabe s zanu pf party. the southern african nation has been on edge since monday when chiwenga, commander of zimbabwe defence forces, said he was prepared to  step in  to end a purge of supporters of a sacked vice president. the unprecedented statement represents an escalation of a rumbling political struggle over who will succeed mugabe, who has been in power since the country gained independence from britain in 1980. mugabe chaired a weekly cabinet meeting in the capital on tuesday. afterwards, zanu pf said it stood by the  primacy of politics over the gun  and accused chiwenga of  treasonable conduct... meant to incite insurrection.  mugabe fired vice president emerson mnangagwa last week. the veteran of the 1970s liberation war was popular with the military and had been seen as a likely successor to mugabe. the army views his removal as part of a purge of independence era figures to pave the way for mugabe to hand power to his wife grace mugabe. a reuters witness saw two armored vehicles parked beside the main road from harare to chinhoyi, about 20 km (14 miles) from the city. one, which was pointed in the direction of the capital, had come off its tracks. witnesses said they saw four armored vehicles turn before reaching harare and head towards the presidential guard compound in a suburb on the outskirts of harare.  there were about four tanks and they turned right here, you can see markings on the road,  one witness on the chinhoyi highway said, referring to the armored vehicles. he pointed to a road that links to the guard compound. the troop movements raise tension on a continent where for decades armies regularly overthrew civilian governments. neither the president nor his wife responded in public to the general s remarks and state media did not publish chiwenga s statement. the herald newspaper posted some of the comments on its twitter page but deleted them. the head of zanu pf s youth wing accused the army chief of subverting the constitution. grace mugabe has developed a strong following in the powerful youth wing.  defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for,  kudzai chipanga, who leads the zanu pf youth league, said at the party s headquarters in harare. grace mugabe s rise has brought her into conflict with the independence era war veterans, who once enjoyed a privileged role in the ruling party under mugabe, but who have in recent years been banished from senior government and party roles. decades ago, zimbabwe had one of africa s promising economies due in part to its agricultural exports. the country is currently struggling to pay for imports due to a dollar crunch, which is also sparking rampant inflation only 10 years after it suffered a financial implosion caused when the central bank began to print money. martin rupiya, an expert on zimbabwe military affairs at the university of south africa in pretoria, said the army appeared to be putting the squeeze on mugabe.  there s a rupture between the executive and the armed forces,  rupiya said. alex magaisa, a british based zimbabwean academic said it was premature to talk about a coup.   a military coup is the nuclear option. a coup would be a very hard sell at home and in the international community. they will want to avoid that,  magaisa said.

" democrats in the u.s. house of representatives opposed to republican legislation that would repeal major sections of the dodd frank financial reform law on tuesday made multiple efforts to delay the bill. the house financial services committee was due to consider representative jeb hensarling’s sweeping bill to rework the 2010 law. in addition to eliminating large portions of dodd frank   enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis   it would put new handcuffs on regulators charged with writing and enforcing its rules. the partisan maneuvering to slow work on the bill demonstrated how divided the two parties are regarding rules for the financial sector, casting doubt on congress’s ability to revisit them significantly despite republican president donald trump’s vow to “do a number” on existing regulations. first, democrats ordered a vote on whether the committee even wanted to actually consider the bill. that amendment passed with support from only the republican majority. then, democrats ordered that all 589 pages of the law be read out loud by the committee clerk. the reading of legislative language is almost always waived by committee members when considering a bill. after about 3 1/2 hours of the bill being read to a largely empty committee room, democrats agreed to shelve that request and proceed to the amendments they wanted to offer. democrats had drawn up roughly 140 amendments they wanted to offer to change the bill, according to a house aide. but that number is expected to shrink as the two parties work out a path forward. hensarling announced on tuesday that despite earlier plans to vote on amendments to the bill throughout the day, no votes would be held on the bill until wednesday morning at the earliest. the procedural obstacles were all aimed at a bill that is not expected to actually become law, as the sweeping rewrite of dodd frank is not expected to garner enough support in the senate, which the republicans hold by a slim majority.  but it is expected to pass the republican led house, and the skirmish over it was a clear indication of how much democrats are willing to dig in on measures that would make life easier for the financial sector. “this is one of the worst bills i’ve seen in my time in congress,” said representative maxine waters, the committee’s top democrat, as the committee began debate on the measure. “the bill is rotten to the core, and simply carries water for trump and his buddies on wall street.” hensarling’s bill would allow large banks to avoid most dodd frank rules if they agree to establish a 10 percent capital ratio, and also scraps several powers given to regulators after the financial crisis to more closely scrutinize some of the nation’s largest institutions. it also makes several changes to the consumer financial protection bureau, severely limiting its power and giving congress and the white house more direct control over its operations and funding.

" rohingya insurgents declared a month long unilateral ceasefire, starting on sunday, to enable aid groups to help ease a humanitarian crisis in northwest myanmar. nearly 300,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh and 30,000 non muslim civilians have been displaced inside myanmar after the military launched a counter offensive following attacks by the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) insurgents on 30 police posts and an army base on aug. 25.  arsa strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period,  arsa said in a statement.   the impact of the move is unclear. the group does not appear to have been able to put up significant resistance against the military force unleashed in myanmar s northwestern rakhine state. in the last two weeks, thousands of homes have been burned down, dozens of villages uprooted and thousands of people are still on the move toward the border with bangladesh. the wave of hungry and traumatized refugees pouring into bangladesh has strained aid agencies and local communities already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in myanmar. in its statement, arsa called on the military to also lay down arms and allow humanitarian aid to all affected people. myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against arsa, which the government has declared a terrorist organization. rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say the army and rakhine buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the muslim population. on friday, the united nations in bangladesh found tens of thousands of refugees who had not been counted before, raising the count to 270,000 from some 164,000 the day before. on saturday, that jumped by another 20,000 to 290,000. on saturday, thousands of rohingya were milling on the road near the camp of kutapalong, carrying bamboo and tarpaulin to build shacks. children and women flocked to every stopping vehicle, begging. aid workers say a serious humanitarian crisis is also unfolding on the myanmar side of the border. red cross organizations are scaling up their operations in rakhine after the united nations had to suspend activities there following government suggestions that its agency had supported the insurgents. the united nations evacuated non critical staff from the area. thousands of displaced people in rakhine have been stranded or left without food for weeks. many are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach bangladesh.   the u.n. and ingos have not been very welcome in rakhine and...they are not able to operate and ensure the safety and security of their staff and volunteers,  said joy singhal of the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc). the government had invited the red cross to assist them, he said. aid workers worry many rohingya had been left without food since mid july, when the world food programme (wfp), which had been providing food and cash assistance, was unable to operate. the government said it would set up camps for internally displaced people in rakhine but the move could draw opposition from u.n. humanitarian experts.

" president donald trump said on friday that he was disappointed that a conservative faction in the house of representatives blocked his healthcare legislation and said “we learned a lot about loyalty” from the effort. speaking in the oval office after a stunning political setback, trump said the healthcare effort was a victim of stalwart democratic opposition and any future healthcare legislation would likely need democratic support. he also said he was surprised and disappointed by the opposition from the house freedom caucus, a group of conservatives who prevented republicans from using their majority in the house to pass the legislation. asked if he felt betrayed by the freedom caucus, trump said he did not. “no, i’m not betrayed. they’re friends of mine. i’m disappointed because we could have had it. so i’m disappointed. i’m a little surprised, to be honest with you,” trump said. “we really had it. it was pretty much there, within grasp. but i’ll tell you what’s going to come of it is a better bill...because there were things in this bill that i didn’t particularly like. if both parties could get together and do real healthcare, that’s the best thing,” he said. trump, a new york businessman who won election nov. 8 based in part on promises to get big deals through congress, cast the failure as a learning experience. “we all learned a lot. we learned a lot about loyalty,” trump said. “we learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the senate and the house.” trump also expressed confidence in house speaker paul ryan, who was seen as the main backer of the legislation. ryan personally delivered the news earlier in the day to trump that there were not enough votes to pass it. “i like speaker ryan. he worked very, very hard. a lot of different groups. he’s got a lot of factions. and there’s been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the republican party, long before i got here,” he said. “i’m not going to speak badly about anybody within the party.” trump has privately told confidants he wished he had done tax reform first instead of getting immersed in the difficult effort to overhaul president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, which passed without republican support in 2010. “we’ll probably be going right now for tax reform,” trump said, saying he wanted “big tax cuts and tax reform. that will be next.” ",0

" brazil s supreme court on wednesday decided to grant congress the final word on decisions to remove a sitting politician, conceding a victory to lawmakers fighting to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption. the narrow 6 5 decision will allow the senate to vote next week to revoke a top court ruling that suspended senator aecio neves who is being investigated in seven corruption cases. a majority of the justices decided to back off from confrontation with congress in the midst of brazil s biggest political corruption scandal, which has even implicated president michel temer and his inner circle of cabinet ministers. the lower house of congress is expected to vote later this month to shelve charges against temer in a corruption case involving meatpacker jbs sa, saving him from trial by the supreme court. more than 110 politicians are targeted by the sprawling car wash graft investigation that has uncovered since 2014 a massive network of bribes and kickbacks paid by companies seeking to win government contracts and influence legislation. congress has pushed back against judicial action by the supreme court since the justices ordered the removal of the former speaker of the lower house, eduardo cunha, who was  arrested last year, convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for corruption. one third of the politicians in brazil s congress   more than 230   including more than half of its senators, are being investigated for breaking the law and face trial by the supreme court, the only court that can try lawmakers and ministers. those being investigated include the presidents of the senate and the lower house, and many of the leaders of temer s governing coalition. in another gain for the political class, the supreme court ruled on tuesday that no one can be charged merely on the basis of plea bargain testimony by just one witness if no evidence is provided to back up the accusation. plea deals have been the main tool used by anti corruption prosecutors to track the network of political kickbacks and   dismantle graft schemes discovered at oil company petrobras and other state run enterprises. the ruling was part of a decision to throw out corruption and money laundering charges against senator renan calheiros, the former president of the senate who faces seven other graft investigations.
