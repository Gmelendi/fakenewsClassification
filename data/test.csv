" the number of refugees arriving in bangladesh from myanmar since aug. 25 has risen to 480,000, international aid bodies said on tuesday, adding that the figure had risen because 35,000 new arrivals had not been included in a previous tally. the refugees are fleeing a myanmar military offensive launched in response to about 30 coordinated attacks by rohingya muslim insurgents on aug. 25.  the change in the new arrivals figure ... is due, in large part, to the additional estimated 35,000 new arrivals settling in the two refugee camps, which was not reported in the last situation report,  the inter sector coordination group of aid agencies said in a statement.

" new zealand s labour party on thursday promised no surprise new taxes until 2020 and improved its position as frontrunner in a national election, with a poll showing its support edging up, threatening the national party s ten year grip on power. the result was at odds with a shock survey by another pollster this week that put the centre right national in the lead and underscored the unusually volatile nature of the race to the vote on sept. 23. backing for the labour party rose 1 point to 44 percent, the one news colmar brunton poll showed, while support for the national party also gained 1 point, putting it at 40 percent. in another positive sign for labour, its potential coalition partner, the green party, recovered, rising 2 points to 7 percent, comfortably above the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament.  the nationalist new zealand first party fell 3 points to 6 percent, making it less likely that labour would need the populist party to form a coalition government after the election. poll results have been swinging wildly and a separate newshub reid poll on tuesday had shown a surprise surge for national, giving it a robust lead of almost ten points. the national party has vowed to support free trade as global protectionism rises, in particular, by championing the trans pacific partnership pact, which labour has said it would renegotiate. an average of polls released by radio new zealand on wednesday, which included the results of newshub s shock poll, put the two parties at almost even support. thursday s poll was published on the same day labour moved to stem criticism of a plan to set up an expert panel to consider new levies, such as a capital gains tax.  to avoid any doubt, no one will be affected by any tax changes arising from the outcomes of the working group until 2021,  said labour finance spokesman grant robertson, in a statement. as rivalry has heated up, labour leader jacinda ardern on wednesday called national  desperate liars  in response to an advertisement saying the centre left party would bring in new taxes and subverting its slogan,  let s do this  into  let s tax this .  investors have been made jittery by the uncertainty over who will govern, but currency reaction to the latest poll was muted.  the new zealand dollar   the word s 11th most traded currency in 2016   softened slightly to $0.7240 from $0.7250 shortly before the poll results.

" republican donald trump could go down as the least well funded presidential candidate in recent campaigns   entering the final month of the election still without the cash to match the level of staff and advertising that has helped power the campaign of his democratic rival hillary clinton. with less than three weeks until the election, it is too late for trump to amass the amount of cash he would need to unleash a spending assault that might turn his hobbled campaign around. through the end of september, trump raised a total of $163 million   a far cry from clinton’s $449 million. trump, a new york real estate developer who has boasted about his wealth, pledged to use millions of his personal assets to fund his campaign. in addition to the $163 million raised, he put in $47.5 million during the primary and then added another $8.6 million. trump’s fundraising deficit has resulted from a series of campaign crises that made wealthy donors reluctant to contribute to his campaign and reflects that he does not enjoy working the fundraising circuit or calling large dollar donors to ask them to write checks. that’s a big disadvantage for trump. and it shows in how he has been outspent trying to win the nov. 8 election for the white house, particularly in the two largest spending categories: staff and television commercials. when it comes to staff, trump has spent $5 million, compared with clinton’s spending of about $38 million.  trump had 168 people on his payroll in september, more than doubling the 82 he had on staff in july. additionally, trump spent $5 million on field consultants, part time workers who are not part of the main staff. clinton had 815 people on her staff in september.  on advertising, trump has spent $48.7 million while clinton has spent $204 million   allowing her to blanket the airwaves with a deluge of advertisements. it has also allowed clinton to inject more money into states that have become closer as election day nears. earlier this week, clinton’s campaign announced it was spending an additional $2 million in arizona, a late game decision to try to win a traditionally republican state that now appears within her grasp. overall, trump has spent about $190 million by the end of september, compared with clinton’s $401 million.  trump and clinton can collect donations up to $5,400 from a single individual, but can also collect larger checks that are then divided between the campaign and joint fundraisers with the national and state parties.  the funds that candidates raise for the national and state political parties are still used for the common effort of hiring staff and getting voters to turn out to the polls. but those funds cannot be used in the most direct parts of running a campaign, like buying television ads or hiring staff that report to the campaign manager. trump’s campaign struggled to get organized and build out the infrastructure that is needed to be competitive in the key battleground states. instead, trump has been dependent on the infrastructure built by the republican party. trump has raised $244 million through joint fundraising committees with the national parties, of which he got $71 million.  by comparison, clinton has raised $415 million through joint fundraisers, of which $117 million went to her campaign. since 2008, major party presidential candidates have stopped accepting public funding for their general election campaigns   which placed limits on the amount a candidate could raise and spend. but even the last candidate to accept public funds, senator john mccain in 2008, raised more that year than trump did this election. mccain raised more than $300 million. that same year, barack obama, in his first presidential race, raised $607 million. in 2012, mitt romney raised more than $337 million at this point in the campaign. and obama had raised $564 million.

" china expressed  strong dissatisfaction  with india on thursday over the recent crash of an indian drone in chinese territory, an incident that could cause more friction along their disputed border. indian and chinese troops confronted each other between june and august this year   at one stage even resorting to scuffling and throwing stones   on a remote plateau near the borders of india, its ally bhutan, and china, in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades. the nuclear armed asian giants have tried to develop their ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over their disputed border, which triggered war in 1962. china s defence ministry said in a statement the indian drone had crashed in  recent days  but it did not give a location.  this action by india violated china s territorial sovereignty. we express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,  zhang shuili, a military official in china s western battle zone command, was quoted as saying in a ministry statement.  china s border defence forces took a professional and responsible attitude in conducting an inspection of the device,  zhang said, adding that the military would  resolutely defend  china s sovereignty and security. the indian army said an unmanned aerial vehicle was on a training mission over indian territory when it developed technical problems and crossed a so called line of actual control separating the countries  militaries. indian border guards alerted their chinese counterparts about the drone soon afterwards, an indian army spokesman said. china had provided the indian army with details about where the drone came down and indian authorities were investigating, colonel aman anand said in a statement.  the matter is being dealt with in accordance with the established protocols,  anand said. china also lodged diplomatic  representations  with india, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular briefing.  china asks india to immediately stop its activities of using unmanned aircraft near the border, and to work alongside china to maintain the border area s peace and tranquillity,  he said. after the weeks of confrontation on the wind swept doklam plateau this year, the two sides agreed to an  expeditious disengagement  of troops about a week before chinese president xi jinping and indian prime minister narendra modi met in an effort to mend ties at a summit in china in september. but the mountainous border remains sensitive for both sides. in november, china criticised a visit by indian president ram nath kovind to the remote state of arunachal pradesh, which china claims, saying china opposed any activities by indian leaders in disputed areas.

" democrats on monday corralled enough support to hold up a senate confirmation vote on president donald trump’s supreme court nominee but republicans threatened to change the senate rules to ensure conservative judge neil gorsuch gets the lifetime job. the senate judiciary committee voted 11 9 along party lines to send gorsuch’s nomination to the full senate, setting up a political showdown this week between trump’s fellow republicans and the opposition democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long standing senate rules to allow his confirmation. democrats, portraying gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream, have amassed 42 senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super majority of 60 votes in the republican led, 100 seat senate to allow a confirmation vote. even before the panel voted, committee member christopher coons put the democrats over the threshold as the 41st senator backing the filibuster bid. (graphic   where senators stand on bid to block gorsuch vote tmsnrt.rs/2ov6ko0)  the senate’s republican leaders insist gorsuch will be confirmed on the senate floor on friday regardless of what the democrats do. republicans hold a 52 48 senate majority. in the face of the filibuster, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of supreme court justices, a move sometimes called the “nuclear option” that trump favors. senate democratic leader chuck schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said mcconnell should have the “vision and courage to see past this impasse” and not “go nuclear,” suggesting that trump replace gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with democrats. senate confirmation of gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine seat high court’s conservative majority, fulfilling one of trump’s top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. trump in january nominated gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from colorado. he could be expected to serve for decades. on the senate floor, mcconnell called the democratic strategy “a new low,” saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as gorsuch. he did not explicitly say he would use the “nuclear option,” but several republicans said that would happen. white house spokesman sean spicer said the decision would be mcconnell’s. republican senator john mccain, a long time opponent of senate rules changes, told reporters he would support the move. judiciary committee republicans blasted democrats for pursuing what they called the first “partisan filibuster” of a supreme court nominee   there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a democratic president’s nominee   and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change. but it was senate republicans who last year refused to even consider democratic former president barack obama’s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump has selected gorsuch to fill. “democrats, including me, are still furious at the way judge merrick garland was treated last year. but the traditions and principles that have defined the senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week,” coons said. gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the february 2016 death of conservative justice antonin scalia. democrats have accused gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of trump, evading questions on key supreme court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans. republicans control the white house and congress for the first time in a decade. the inability of senate republicans to coax enough democratic support to avoid the “nuclear option” reflected the intense partisan divide in washington and the trump administration’s failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party. senators dianne feinstein, the committee’s top democrat, and panel member patrick leahy, along with fellow democrats mark warner and ben cardin, also announced filibuster support on monday. spicer accused democrats of partisan obstruction that sets “a very dangerous precedent” and told a briefing that “we’re obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nation’s highest court.” the actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped. to date, four democrats oppose a filibuster, four short of the eight that republicans needed. with the failure of republican healthcare legislation in congress and with courts blocking the president’s ban on people from several muslim majority nations from entering the united states, winning confirmation for gorsuch has taken on even more importance for trump. the 60 vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. republican committee member lindsey graham said, “if we have to, we will change the rules, and it looks like we’re going to have to. i hate that. i really, really do.” while gorsuch’s opponents would fight a senate rule change, it was the democrats who in 2013 changed the senate rules to limit filibusters after republicans used the procedure against obama’s appeals court nominees.  the senate, then led by democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices. even if republicans do change the rules, legislation, as opposed to appointments, would still need to meet a 60 vote threshold.

" republican donald trump’s surprise defeat in iowa at the hands of u.s. senator ted cruz reflected shortcomings in his get out the vote operations and an over reliance on his celebrity status in a state where voters prefer the personal touch. the new york billionaire and former tv reality star generated much enthusiasm for his anti establishment message, but in the end he was out muscled by cruz’ more traditional ground game and saw some late deciding voters side with u.s. senator marco rubio. all signs had pointed to a trump victory in the first nominating contest in the race for the white house, with the des moines register’s influential poll giving trump the lead on the weekend before iowans went to caucus on monday.  the loss, while not by a large margin, raised questions about trump’s ability to perform as well in voting contests as he does in polls. prior to monday, trump had repeatedly boasted that he would easily win iowa, and he has been the front runner in most national polls since last summer.  sensing victory, trump had mocked cruz’s ground game in the hours before voters went to their caucus sites. “i hear they all have these great ground games, they’ve got people pouring in on buses and trucks,” trump said at a campaign rally. “they are spending all the money they have from special interests. for our country, i want the person who is going to spend the least amount and get the best results.” trump had relied on what iowa republican party chairman jeff kaufmann told reuters was a “stealth” ground effort. for some though, the specifics of trump’s plan for turning out his supporters on monday were questionable. instead of aggressively trying to convert any and all republicans to his cause as cruz did, trump relied mostly on signing up supporters from among those who attended his rallies.  the challenge trump faced was trying to persuade these people, many of whom had never participated in a caucus before, to show up. tana goertz, trump’s iowa campaign chair, was frequently an introductory speaker at trump events and would encourage attendees to make sure they knew where to go to caucus. leaflets were passed out reassuring voters that the ballot is secret and, “most caucuses take less than 1 hour.” “it’s new to a lot of these people who were supporting him,” said david mcneer, of newton, iowa, who steered his precinct into overwhelmingly voting for trump. “it may be at the end that some of them didn’t come out like they thought were going to come out.” trump’s bombastic style and flair for the dramatic may in the end have not helped as much as he would have hoped. as cruz and rubio went the more traditional route of talking to small groups of people at pizza parlors and hotel conference rooms, trump would make a dramatic entrance in his private jet, emblazoned with his name, and tear into his rivals at rallies attended by thousands. he made pandering comments like wanting to buy a farm in iowa and hoping his pregnant daughter would deliver her baby in the state. he did few small events. gary updegraff, an enthusiastic trump backer and precinct chairman in des moines, said he believed trump would adjust his style. “he’s a very smart man, he’s going to analyze this with his people, he’ll talk to his family probably about it. i think the genuineness of donald trump needs to come out a little bit more,” updegraff said. trump took some initial steps in this direction in the final days before the caucus. he appeared with evangelical leader jerry falwell jr., who asked trump friendly questions that played up the candidate’s contributions to charitable causes and pointed out he served cheeseburgers, not caviar, on his plane. at least some of his supporters think trump might have performed better if he had participated in a fox news debate last week instead of boycotting in opposition to anchor megyn kelly and a fox news release he felt had a biting tone. “i think a lot of things caught up to him here in the last couple of weeks,” said trump supporter brett ridge of des moines, speaking shortly after trump’s concession speech. “when it comes down to it, he should have been at the debate last week.” trump noted in his concession speech that some had argued he would never do well in the state. “iowa, we love you,” trump said in defeat. “you are very special. i think we might come back here and buy a farm.”  (additional reporting by ginger gibson, editing by paul thomasch and ross colvin) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0

" illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a bill passed by the democratic controlled legislature in april to spend nearly $3.9 billion on state services that have not been funded due to an ongoing fiscal 2016 budget impasse. the republican governor called the legislation “an empty promise.” “the bill purports to appropriate $3.89 billion, including more than $3 billion in general funds that the state does not have, for higher education and social service providers, but provides no source of funding,” rauner said in his veto message.  the political stalemate between rauner and democrats has left illinois as the only u.s. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget, operating instead on court ordered spending and a muddled patchwork of ongoing and stopgap appropriations. rauner called on lawmakers to pass complete balanced budgets for the current and next fiscal years, although the governor has proposed funding most fiscal 2017 services with a temporary spending plan and k 12 schools with a full year budget. illinois’ new fiscal year begins on july 1. the democrats’ spending bill passed with enough votes in the senate to override a veto, but fell short of that margin in the house. the measure would have sent money to cash starved state universities and colleges, covered tuition grants for low income college students, and funded health and human services that were not subject to court orders. the measure also appropriated about $63 million for unpaid wage increases owed to about 24,000 unionized state workers.

" the prospect of running for re election with donald trump at the top of the republican ticket was worrying some party lawmakers as they huddled for an annual retreat, where a few forecast trouble if trump becomes the party’s presidential nominee. “heaven help us,” representative peter roskam said when asked about it by a reporter. but the illinois republican quickly added, “i’m not going to comment on the presidential candidates at this point.” that reticence was shared by many lawmakers asked about running on trump’s coattails during an event in baltimore where senate and house of representatives republicans gathered to talk through their priorities for a coming year whose highlight is the november election. some were not reluctant to express concerns. trump would not help republicans if he topped the ticket, despite his appeal to americans fed up with politicians, said representative justin amash, a favorite of the conservative tea party movement who has endorsed kentucky republican senator rand paul for president. “he does appeal to the anger,” amash said of trump, the outspoken real estate mogul who is front runner to be the party’s presidential nominee. but he said trump’s “policy prescriptions will take us in the wrong direction, and it won’t be long before many of those people are angry at him and angry at republicans again.” the idea of trump capturing the republican nomination seemed highly unlikely just months ago, but it was sinking in as an actual possibility this week across the republican party. in addition to voting for a new president, americans will elect members of the senate and the house on nov. 8. in u.s. politics, a party’s presidential nominee has a big impact on  the campaigns of candidates for both chambers of congress. at the party gathering, republican leaders were keen to talk policy, not presidential politics. “what happens above us on the presidential ballot, you really don’t control,” senator john thune, a senior party leader from south dakota, told reporters. house speaker paul ryan, of wisconsin, said: “we are not sitting here thinking about who the nominee is going to be. we don’t have time to think about that.” but in the hallways of the retreat, at a hotel on baltimore’s restored waterfront, trump was often the hot topic. he is leading national opinion polls ahead of the feb. 1 iowa caucus, the first step in the nominating process. representative jason chaffetz said it was important to have a presidential nominee who will not “embarrass” the rest of the party’s candidates as they defend the republican majorities in both congressional chambers. chaffetz, who is from utah, has endorsed marco rubio, a republican senator from florida. polls show rubio in third place behind trump and texas senator ted cruz in iowa. “marco rubio is not going to embarrass us ... he’s not as sensational in his comments as the others, but there’s a good quality to that, and i think that’s also something you look for in a president,” chaffetz said. among other proposals, trump has called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and a wall along the u.s. border with mexico to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. representative tom cole said republicans’ fate will be linked closely to the republican nominee, whoever it is.  trump would be a wild card, said cole, of oklahoma. “i don’t know what he (trump) will do. i can see a situation where he could be a great asset, because i do think he will bring some people out (to vote) who have not been brought before.” representative peter king of new york agreed that trump is “more of a gamble” at the top of the ticket. “the conventional wisdom is that he would hurt more than he would help,” said king, who was unable to attend the retreat but spoke by telephone. “but on the other hand, he is tapping into something (among voters) out there.”  (editing by kevin drawbaugh, caren bohan and frances kerry) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" former u.s. senator and democratic vice presidential candidate joe lieberman has withdrawn from consideration to be the next director of the fbi, citing the potential for an appearance of a conflict of interest given president donald trump’s decision to retain an attorney who works at the same firm. lieberman works at a new york firm headed by marc kasowitz, who has been hired by trump to represent him amid probes by the justice department and congress into possible ties between trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and russia. “with your selection of marc kasowitz to represent you in the various investigations that have begun, i do believe it would be best to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest,” lieberman wrote to trump in a letter dated wednesday. a copy of the letter, which was first disclosed by the wall street journal, was provided to reuters on thursday. the white house did not respond to a request for comment on lieberman’s withdrawal. trump told reporters a week ago that he was “very close” to selecting a nominee to replace james comey as director of the federal bureau of investigation, and he said lieberman was a leading candidate.  trump fired comey on may 9, a decision that set off a political firestorm given comey’s central role in the fbi’s probe of russian meddling in the election and potential collusion between trump campaign associates and russian officials seeking to swing the vote in trump’s favor. the department of justice appointed a special counsel, former fbi director robert mueller, to lead an independent investigation into the russia matter. given kasowitz’s role, lieberman might not have been able to participate in the russia investigation for a period of two years without white house and justice department waivers, kathleen clark, a professor of legal ethics at washington university school of law told reuters on wednesday. a federal regulation restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm’s clients for one year, a period that was extended to two years under an executive order signed by trump in january. cnn, citing a unnamed senior administration official, reported on wednesday that trump wanted to renew the search for an fbi director after having interviewed a number of candidates, including lieberman. on thursday, citing unnamed sources, cnn said john pistole, a former deputy director at the fbi and a former head of the transportation security administration, was under consideration.

" the governor of colorado said on sunday he believes the cuban government wants to further improve relations with the united states under president donald trump, as he wrapped up a three day visit to the communist run island nation. “they seemed eager for the chance to build a relationship with president trump and have it be a constructive one,” governor john hickenlooper, a democrat, said of his meeting with cuba’s point person for u.s. relations, josefina vidal. he said in an interview that vidal, director of u.s. affairs at the cuban foreign ministry, and other foreign ministry officials “were cautiously optimistic.” “they realize they have to wait and that the new administration has a lot of things going on. they understand things could change in some ways, but i didn’t sense there was any fear or some sort of depression,” the governor said. hickenlooper, who traveled with a cultural and business delegation, was the highest ranking elected u.s. official to meet with vidal since trump assumed office last month. trump has said he wanted a better deal than that brokered by his predecessor, barack obama. on friday, white house press secretary sean spicer said a “full review” of america’s foreign policy toward cuba was underway. obama and cuban president raul castro stunned the world in december 2014 when they announced the two governments would restore diplomatic ties after more than 50 years of cold war hostilities and work to normalize relations. the colorado governor said the purpose of his trip was to view post fidel castro cuba and invite the country to his state’s biennial of the americas, which brings together the cultures, businesses and ideas of north and south america. hickenlooper said the cubans had enthusiastically accepted the invitation to attend the event in september. hickenlooper said he did not doubt many innocent people were hurt during the early years of the revolution, but most of those involved had passed away. “the younger people seem eager to build a relationship with the united states,” he said. the governor, a former entrepreneur and restaurant owner, spent a day meeting with small business owners and said he had visited five private eateries. “i was surprised. one has this vision of everyone being downtrodden, and there was so much optimism and positive energy,” he said. “some of the business people did say if you see president trump please tell him to let us keep the beginnings of this new inspiration,” he said.

" china has shut down or “dealt with” thousands of websites for sharing “harmful” erotic or obscene content since april, the state’s office for combating pornography and illegal publications announced on thursday. the office said 2,500 websites were prosecuted or shut down and more than 3 million “harmful” posts were deleted in eight months up to december during a drive to “purify” the internet in china and protect youth, the official xinhua news agency reported. the government has tightening its grip on chinese cyberspace in recent months, in particular placing new restrictions on the fast growing live streaming industry. the state has a zero tolerance approach to what it considers lewd, smutty or illegal content and has in past crackdowns removed tens of thousands of websites in a single year. two popular news websites were also punished for spreading “illegal” content, xinhua reported. it did not elaborate. aside from live streaming, the office worked alongside the ministry of public security, the ministry of industry and information technology and the cyberspace administration of china to target cloud storage, chat apps and “vulgar” videos. social media platforms have become a key tool for spreading illegal content and mobile pay platforms including alipay and wechat pay have allowed individuals to make big profits, the office said.

" mexican authorities on wednesday arrested a former high ranking official of president enrique pena nieto s party in a corruption investigation in the northern state of chihuahua, the state s governor said. the arrest extends a streak of corruption allegations dogging the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri), with four former governors arrested on such charges this year. entrenched corruption is expected to be a key issue in the runup to mexico s next presidential election in 2018. alejandro gutierrez, who was the adjunct secretary to the presidency of the pri, was arrested in a joint operation by state and federal police, chihuahua governor javier corral wrote in a post on facebook. the chihuahua prosecutor s office accused gutierrez of participating in a  sophisticated scheme  to divert public funds of 250 million pesos ($13 million) earmarked for educational programs in 2016. gutierrez will present himself before a judge early thursday, the office said in a statement. this week, mexican newspaper reforma published reports on an alleged chihuahua corruption scheme to funnel the money into the pri s campaign fund, through avenues such as fake contracts for workshops for parents and expensive software. the reports were based on testimony to prosecutors by former state finance minister jaime herrera that the paper obtained.  gutierrez  arrest took place in coahuila. this week, he rejected allegations against him in an interview with mexican newspaper vanguardia, saying he was considering suing for defamation.  i am thinking, i will have to look into it, if i initiate some legal proceeding,  he said.  i do not know, i repeat to you, i did not know not even one official, nor ex official, of finances... i see things that are absolutely false.  gutierrez  arrest  contributes to the clearing up of the crimes of political corruption that have been attributed to the former governor, c sar duarte j quez,  said corral, of the national action party.   the government is determining whether others should be held responsible for the funneling of funds to pri coffers in 2016, corral added. in march, a mexican judge issued an arrest warrant for duarte on suspicion of embezzlement. corral has said he is a fugitive from justice. a spokesman for the pri did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the pri was routed in 2016 regional elections, losing several of its bastions, including the states of veracruz, tamaulipas and quintana roo, as voters expressed discontent over a series of graft scandals.

" the white house is vetting federal appellate judge jane kelly for a possible u.s. supreme court nomination to replace the late justice antonin scalia, the new york times reported on wednesday, citing a person with knowledge of the process. the fbi has been conducting background interviews on kelly, the times said, citing the unnamed source. scalia, a long serving conservative justice, died on feb. 13. the white house declined to comment on the report. kelly, a white woman and former public defender, has served on the st. louis based 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals since april 2013. she was confirmed to the post by the senate on a 96 0 vote.  she had been mentioned by legal experts as a potential nominee in part because her earlier nomination to the appeals court was supported by iowa republican senator chuck grassley, the chairman of the senate judiciary committee that would review any supreme court nomination. grassley said at the time that kelly was “well regarded in my home state of iowa” and that he was “pleased to support” her nomination.  kelly, 51, served as a clerk for now retired judge david hansen, a friend of grassley who served on the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals. republican leaders have so far rebuffed president barack obama’s appeal to hold confirmation hearings and a vote on a nominee, including in a face to face meeting on tuesday at the white house that failed to budge them from their vow to block anyone he offers for the job. republicans say the decision on who to nominate should be left to the next president, who takes office next january after the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. republicans hope to win back the white house then. under the u.s. constitution, the president nominates supreme court justices and the senate must confirm them. without scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. nevada governor brian sandoval, a moderate republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the supreme court last week, a day after his name surfaced in connection with the scalia vacancy.

" u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday that the trump administration has no desire to get into trade wars, but  certain trade relationships need to be re examined to make them fairer for u.s. workers. at a news conference with german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble, mnuchin said that president donald trump views trade as important for economic growth. but when asked whether the group of 20 finance ministers should explicitly reaffirm their past vow to resist protectionism, mnuchin repeated his view that some u.s. trade relationships need to be re examined to make them fairer and more reciprocal.  “it is not our desire to get into trade wars,” mnuchin said. “the president does believe in free trade but he wants free and fair trade.” differences over trade could become a sticking point for  g20 finance officials at a meeting in the spa town of baden baden, germany this weekend. schaeuble told reuters in an interview that it was unclear whether the anti protectionism language would remain in the g20 statement to be issued at the meeting’s close on saturday.  given that trump’s “america first” agenda, trade issues could be set aside for g20 leaders to tackle at a summit in july, schaeuble said. but both schaeuble and mnuchin both said they had a constructive discussion ahead of the g20 meeting and pledged to work together through differences to promote growth. “it was a good start,” schaeuble said of the meeting, adding that it was a positive sign for international cooperation and the g20 process. “we have found a good basis to talk openly about issues where we don’t have the same stance from the outset,” schaeuble said. mnuchin said the ministers agreed that they should fight currency manipulation. the us treasury chief declined to comment specifically on the euro’s current value, but in a shift away from criticism by white house national trade council director peter navarro that germany has benefited unfairly from the euro’s weakness, mnuchin acknowledged that the euro is used by many countries and is affected by many factors.  “it is different than a single currency controlled by a single country,” mnuchin said of the euro. he also said that for trade, he views the european union as both a single bloc as well as individual countries. regarding the u.s. dollar, mnuchin reiterated his view that a strengthening dollar was good for the long run, but declined to comment on short term movements in the dollar. in recent weeks, he has said that short term dollar spikes can be negative for the u.s. economy. “i believe that in the long term best interests, the strengthening of the dollar is a good thing and i think that the long term strengthening of the dollar is a sign of confidence in the reserve currency,” he said.

" u.s. president elect donald trump sowed more doubt about his position on nuclear proliferation on friday, reportedly welcoming an arms race even as his spokesman insisted that an atomic weapons build up was not likely to happen. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, caused alarm on thursday on twitter, saying the united states “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” on friday, he had an off air phone conversation about the tweet with msnbc tv host mika brzezinski, who said trump told her: “let it be an arms race. we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.” msnbc did not play his comments on air. but trump spokesman sean spicer said in a round of television interviews on friday that trump’s comments were meant to send a general message of strength to countries like russia and china rather than indicate the united states planned to build up its nuclear capabilities. “he is going to do what it takes to protect this country and if another country or countries want to threaten our safety and sovereignty, he is going to do what it takes,” spicer said on cnn. “if another country expands theirs (nuclear capability), the united states will act in kind ... but i do believe that it won’t happen because i think what they have seen, domestically and internationally, is this is a man of action,” spicer said. russian president vladimir putin, at his annual news conference in moscow on friday, said he saw nothing new or remarkable about trump’s tweet on thursday, and made clear he did not see the united states as a potential aggressor.  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on friday that russia has never initiated an arms race and never will, the ria news agency reported. in an apparent attempt to calm any tensions about his nuclear comments, trump said in a statement on friday that he had received “a very nice letter” from putin earlier this month calling for stronger relations between the two countries.     a nuclear arms race is diametrically opposed to decades of republican orthodoxy that has called for cuts in u.s. nuclear weapons since the ronald reagan white house. trump’s tweet prompted analysts to question whether trump was threatening to abrogate the 2011 new start treaty, which limits deployed warheads and delivery systems   or would begin deploying other warheads. the united states is one of five nuclear weapons states allowed to keep a nuclear arsenal under the nuclear non proliferation treaty. the others are russia, britain, france and china. the united states is in the midst of a $1 trillion, 30 year  modernization of its aging ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land based missiles, a price tag that most experts say the u.s. cannot afford. russia, also bound by the treaty limits, is also carrying out a modernization program but is not expanding its warhead stockpile. twitter is trump’s communication method of choice. but its 140 character limit does not lend itself well to talking about complex geopolitical issues like nuclear proliferation fraught with risk, analysts charged. “he must have leaders around the world trying to guess what he means,” daryl kimball, the executive director of the arms control association, said on thursday.  shares of uranium producers and a nuclear fuel technology company have jumped on trump’s comments with uranium resources inc, uranium energy corp, cameco corp and lightbridge corp all trading higher on friday.

" public sector unions triumphed before the u.s. supreme court on tuesday when the justices preserved a vital source of cash for organized labor, splitting 4 4 on a conservative challenge that had seemed destined for success until justice antonin scalia’s death last month. the case brought by non union public school teachers in california had targeted fees that many states force such workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities. a loss in this case would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout. the outcome illustrated the impact on the court of the feb. 13 death of scalia, the long serving conservative justice who almost certainly would have cast a decisive vote against the unions. but by virtue of splitting 4 4, the justices affirmed a 2014 lower court ruling that allowed california to compel non union workers to pay the fees.  “the death of justice scalia has proved a disaster for public sector workers who have their paychecks raided by unions,” said iain murray, vice president for strategy at the competitive enterprise institute, a conservative think tank in washington.  the court, evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives, left intact a 1977 legal precedent that allowed such fees, which conservatives have long abhorred. conservatives for years have tried to curb the influence of public sector unions, which typically back the democratic party and liberal causes. “the u.s. supreme court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession,” said lily eskelsen garcia, president of the national education association teachers union. the case reached the high court after a washington based conservative group, the center for individual rights, sued on behalf of lead plaintiff rebecca friedrichs, an elementary school teacher in anaheim, and nine other teachers. they argued the fees infringed upon the free speech rights of non union workers under the u.s. constitution. during jan. 11 oral arguments in the case, scalia was still on the bench, giving the court a majority of five conservatives. the conservative justices during the arguments voiced support for the non union teachers. it is the second case in which the court has split 4 4 since scalia died, with more likely in the coming months, perhaps including major cases on abortion, voting rights and contraception insurance coverage. it remains unclear when scalia will be replaced. senate republicans have vowed to block confirmation of president barack obama’s nominee to replace scalia, centrist appellate judge merrick garland. republicans fear garland’s confirmation would tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. at issue in the case decided on tuesday were so called agency fees equivalent to union dues, currently mandatory for non union workers under laws in about half the states including california. the decision means the status quo remains, with the unions able to collect fees from non union workers. california’s non union teachers pay the union, which has 325,000 members, around $600 annually in mandatory fees for collective bargaining. the non union teachers’ lawyers said they plan to ask the court to rehear case. “with the death of justice scalia, this outcome was not unexpected,” said terry pell, president of the center for individual rights. the split decision means there is “ongoing doubt about the constitutionality of its forcible collection of millions of dollars in dues,” pell added. about 5 million public sector employees are subject to union contracts that include mandatory fee provisions, according to the national right to work legal defense foundation, which backed the non union teachers. organized labor had expressed worries that a ruling throwing out the fees would give employees less incentive to join public sector unions because they would get all the benefits of collective bargaining undertaken by unions without having to pay for it. the teachers who filed the lawsuit in 2013 asked the justices to overturn the 1977 abood v. detroit board of education supreme court ruling that allowed laws that permitted public sector unions to collect fees from workers who were not members as long as the money was not spent on political activities. agency fees are already banned in 25 states that have so called right to work laws. in those states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower. federal employee unions also cannot collect such fees. the ruling comes as a relief to organized labor because unionized civil servants in states without right to work laws comprise its main power base. the court last week also split 4 4 split in a loan discrimination case. last month, dow chemical co opted to settle a class action case pending before the court for $835 million, citing scalia’s death as a reason. scalia was seen as a reliable vote for class action defendants.

" as u.s. defense secretary jim mattis peered into north korea from a lookout post on friday, he was given a blunt reminder by his south korean counterpart of the vast amount of north korean artillery within range of seoul.  above the faint sound of north korean propaganda music being blasted from across the border, south korean defense minister song young moo suggested that u.s. and south korean missile defenses simply could not stop all of them.   defending against this many lras (long range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,  song told mattis, citing a need for strategies to  offensively neutralize  the artillery in the event of a conflict.  mattis replied:  understood.   the brief exchange at the inter korean demilitarized zone (dmz)   where u.s .president donald trump may visit in coming days   spoke volumes about the risks of any miscalculation as tension soars over pyongyang s rapidly advancing nuclear weapon and missile programs.  last week, cia chief mike pompeo said north korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the united states with nuclear weapons, a scenario trump has vowed to prevent.  u.s. intelligence experts say pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get pyongyang to willingly denuclearise.  but, as the dmz trip highlighted, north korea s conventional weaponry poses such a risk to south korea that any attempt to denuclearize the north by force could easily escalate into a devastating conflict.  mattis was keen to emphasize efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, including at the dmz, as he addressed reporters with his back to the dividing line between north and south.   our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula,  mattis said, as north korean soldiers kept watch.  mattis said he and song also made clear their mutual commitment  to a diplomatic solution to address north korea s reckless, outlaw behavior,  when they met this week at a gathering of asian defense chiefs in the philippines.  he carried that same message after his helicopter flight back to seoul, where he addressed a small group of u.s. and south korean soldiers.  ""it comes down to you to make it work, my fine young troops ... and we'll buy time for our diplomats to solve this problem,"" he said.  the emphasis on diplomacy came before trump departs next week on a trip to asia. he has declined to say whether he will visit the dmz when he stops in south korea, telling reporters on wednesday:  you ll be surprised.   trump, in a speech last month at the united nations, threatened to destroy north korea if necessary to defend the united states and its allies. kim has blasted trump as  mentally deranged.   the bellicose verbal exchanges have stoked fears of a military confrontation, but white house officials say trump is looking for a peaceful resolution.  at the same time, the u.s. and south korean militaries are looking for ways to deter pyongyang, and bolster its defenses.  as mattis at one point met some of the roughly 28,000 american forces stationed in south korea, he said the role of u.s. and south korean troops was essential.   we re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can. but ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, so they speak from a position of strength,  he said.   so thanks for standing watch, for holding the line.

" the united states is ready to confront china should it continue its overreaching maritime claims in the south china sea, the head of the u.s. pacific fleet said on wednesday, comments that threaten to escalate tensions between the two global rivals. china claims most of the resource rich south china sea through which about $5 trillion in ship borne trade passes every year. neighbors brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam also have claims. the united states has called on china to respect the findings of the arbitration court in the hague earlier this year which invalidated its vast territorial claims in the strategic waterway. but beijing continues to act in an “aggressive” manner, to which the united states stands ready to respond, admiral harry harris, head of the u.s. pacific command, said in a speech in sydney. “we will not allow a shared domain to be closed down unilaterally no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the south china sea,” he said. “we will cooperate when we can but we will be ready to confront when we must.” the comments threaten to stoke tensions between the united states and china, already heightened by president elect donald trump’s decision to accept a telephone call from taiwan’s president on dec. 2 that prompted a diplomatic protest from beijing. asked about harris’s remarks, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the situation in the south china sea was currently stable, thanks to the hard work of china and others in the region. “we hope the united states can abide by its promises on not taking sides on the sovereignty dispute in the south china sea, respect the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability in the south china sea region and do more to promote peace and stability there,” he told a daily news briefing. the united states estimates beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of land on seven features in the south china sea over the past three years, building runways, ports, aircraft hangars and communications equipment. in response, the united states has conducted a series of freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea, the latest of which came in october. the patrols have angered beijing, with a senior chinese official in july warning the practice may end in “disaster”. harris said it was a decision for the australian government whether the u.s. ally should undertake its own freedom of navigation operations, but said the united states would continue with the practice.     “the u.s. fought its first war following our independence to ensure freedom of navigation,” said harris. “this is an enduring principle and one of the reasons our forces stand ready to fight tonight.” ",0
" students at an islamic school that indonesian authorities have linked to islamic state returned home after villagers nearby demanded its closure, a school spokesman said on sunday. a reuters investigation published this month found at least eight staff and four students from the ibnu mas ud school in sukajaya, west java either traveled or tried to travel to syria to join the jihadist group between 2013 and 2016. spokesman jumadi told reuters the school was empty after the local police chief said failure to comply with the closure demands would lead to a  big demonstration  by residents from five surrounding districts. the school denies it supports is, or any other militant groups. it also says it does not advocate a violent or extreme version of islam. jumadi, who goes by only one name, said the police warning prompted the school to call parents to pick up the roughly 250 students. police could not be immediately reached for comment. one of the four students, hatf saiful rasul, left for syria when he was 11 and died fighting with is a year later in september 2016. his father, imprisoned militant syaiful anam, wrote that his son was inspired to travel by teachers and students of the school who had joined is. during the school s decade of operation in depok, outside jakarta, and then at sukajaya, at least another 18 people with links to it have been convicted or are now under arrest for militant plots and attacks in indonesia, reuters reported. they include former students, teachers, parents, founders and donors. during its investigation, reuters reviewed court documents, deeds of entitlement and interrogation reports, and interviewed counter terrorism police, donors and former militants. school head agus purwoko told reporters last week it only taught pupils  how to read and memorize the koran.    so ibnu mas ud, in a way, is a childcare. there are also parents who send their kids here because they are divorcing, going to jail, or facing other problems.  sukajaya village chief wahyudin sumardi told reuters in july that residents had been concerned about activities at the school for years. local resentment ignited when a member of the school s staff allegedly burned a red and white banner in the village celebrating indonesia s independence day on aug. 17. irate residents rallied outside the school, according to police, village chief wahyudin and school spokesman jumadi. jumadi agreed the next day to move or close the school in a month. but school head agus and some rights activists said he signed documents under duress and the school should not be closed on the basis of minor damage to patriotic bunting.  we asked the police to prevent the mass protesters taking the law into their own hands and to separate the activities of the children from allegations of involvement in terrorism,  said usman hamid, director of amnesty international indonesia. hamid said the school s closure would increase the students  chances of being radicalized.

" senior saudi arabian prince miteb bin abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, has been freed after agreeing to pay over $1 billion to settle corruption allegations against him, a saudi official said on wednesday. miteb, 65, son of the late king abdullah and former head of the elite national guard, was among dozens of royal family members, high officials and senior businessmen rounded up this month in a crackdown on graft that has strengthened the power of crown prince mohammed bin salman. the official, who is involved in the crackdown and spoke on condition of anonymity, said miteb was released on tuesday after reaching  an acceptable settlement agreement . the official said he believed the agreed sum to be the equivalent of over $1 billion.  it is understood that the settlement included admitting corruption involving known cases,  the official said, without giving details. according to the official, prince miteb was accused of embezzlement, hiring ghost employees and awarding contracts to his own firms, including a deal for walkie talkies and bulletproof military gear. prince miteb is the first senior figure known to be released among those detained. around 200 people in total have been questioned in the crackdown, authorities said earlier this month. the allegations, which include kickbacks, inflating government contracts, extortion and bribery, could not be independently verified. saudi authorities, who estimate they could eventually recover around $100 billion of illicit funds, have been working on reaching agreements with suspects detained at riyadh s luxurious ritz carlton hotel, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom. apart from miteb, the saudi official said that at least three other suspects had finalised settlement agreements and that the public prosecutor had decided to release several individuals.  the prosecutor has decided to put at least five people on trial, the official said without disclosing their identities. the fate of billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal, chairman of investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se and one of saudi arabia s most prominent international businessmen, was not known.  kingdom issued a statement earlier this month saying it was continuing to operate normally but has not responded to queries about his status since he was detained early this month. two saudi sources told reuters that prince alwaleed has so far refused to reach a settlement and had asked for access to his lawyer in order to fight allegations against him. relatives, his lawyer and officials in his office could not be contacted to comment.   saudi arabia s stock market .tasi, where many investors have been alarmed by the corruption probe, rose after news of the settlements by prince miteb and others. the main index was trading 0.4 percent higher around midday on wednesday. the settlements may mean authorities can soon wind down parts of the probe, reducing the risk of damage to the economy through the freezing of hundreds of bank accounts, and easing the danger that firms linked to detainees could be affected. officials from prince miteb s office could not be reached for comment about his release, and it was unclear if he was able to move freely or whether he would be put under house arrest. an acquaintance of the family said earlier on his twitter account that prince miteb was receiving brothers and sons at his palace in riyadh.  the arrests of royals and top businessmen have been welcomed by many saudis who are frustrated by corruption, but the crackdown is also seen by many people as a pre emptive step by prince mohammed to remove any possible challenge to his control over the world s top oil exporting country. the round up follows a meticulously planned palace coup in june through which prince mohammed ousted his elder cousin prince mohammed bin nayef as heir to the throne. prince miteb, as overlord of the 100,000 strong national guard, represented the last great competing power center left after the toppling of prince mohammed bin nayef. in september, religious and intellectual critics of the government were jailed.

" brazil s supreme court has suspended a decree issued by president michel temer s government changing the definition of slavery that was widely condemned as a reversal in the fight against forced labor. in her decision taken on monday and made public on tuesday, justice rosa weber said the decree s reduction of the scope of what is considered slave labor violated the constitution. weber also argued that the measure could hurt brazil s trade relations since other countries could complain that slave labor was a form of unfair competition. faced with an outpouring of criticism, the government said on friday that it would pull the decree and issue a new one. in brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern day slavery. this includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. human rights campaigners said the decree issued by the labor ministry on monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. the decree, supported by brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery like conditions since 1995, federal prosecutors and labor inspectors said. temer opponents said he bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in congress on wednesday to block corruption charges against him.  in exchange for support to escape a criminal trial, temer promised the farm lobby goods he cannot deliver,  said lawmaker alessandro molon of the leftist sustainability network, the party that asked the court to stop the decree. molon called the slave labor decree one the most  abject bargains  in the country s history.

" a bipartisan delegation of u.s. senators visiting afghanistan on tuesday called for a new strategy from the trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong taliban insurgency and end the longest war in u.s. history. the delegation led by senator john mccain was in kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighboring pakistan. the visit preceded an expected trump review later in the month of the strategy for the united states’ longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last year’s presidential campaign. since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, afghanistan’s u.s. backed government has lost ground to a taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made afghanistan the second ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind syria. mccain said in a kabul press briefing on tuesday at nato coalition headquarters that “none of us would say that we are on a course to success here in afghanistan”. “that needs to change and quickly,” added mccain, a sharp critic of trump within their republican party.   mccain was accompanied by u.s. senators lindsey graham, elizabeth warren, sheldon whitehouse and david perdue on the regional tour. warren, a massachusetts democrat, said she came to get “the view on the ground about what is happening” in afghanistan. “we need a strategy in the united states that defines our role in afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there,” warren said. u.s. officials have told reuters that defense secretary jim mattis will present trump with strategic options for  afghanistan by mid july.  last month, trump gave mattis the authority to set american troop levels in afghanistan, but as commander in chief trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war. u.s. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000 5,000 troops for still inexperienced afghan security forces, while also tracking down al qaeda, islamic state and other global islamist militants based in afghanistan.  the commander of u.s. and nato forces in afghanistan, general john nicholson, has said “several thousand” more foreign troops – mostly trainers    are needed to break a military stalemate with the taliban. in 2001, a u.s. backed military intervention in afghanistan toppled the taliban regime, whose ultra hardline interpretation of sharia (islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough. more than 15 years later, about 13,000 u.s. and allied troops remain in afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory. several thousand more american troops operate under a counterterrorism mission aimed at groups like islamic state and al qaeda.

"it was only a matter of time we can t keep our borders open to anyone who cares to cross over, offer them immunity from the law in sanctuary cities that basically give criminals the ability to move around freely and expect a positive result. we asked for it when most american citizens sat back and allowed obama to bully our border agents into submission, while shaming our government officials and law enforcement agencies for daring to demand stricter immigration controls. there s a good reason donald j. trump rose to the top of the packed gop presidential field when he mentioned building a wall on our southern border and clamping down on the insane flow of unvetted immigrants and refugees into the united states.hillary is on the same team as obama when it comes to unchecked illegal immigration. brentwood, n.y.   four dead teenagers. two weeks. one town. and a ruthless gang, the authorities say, was most likely responsible for the toll. again.on sept. 13, nisa mickens, 15, and her best friend, kayla cuevas, 16, were murdered, their battered bodies found near an elementary school here. a week later and just two miles away, the skeletal remains of two more teenagers   identified as oscar acosta, 19, and miguel garcia-moran, 15   were found in the woods near a psychiatric hospital. oscar had been missing since may, miguel since february. their deaths have been ruled homicides.brentwood, a hardscrabble town of nearly 60,000 on long island, 40 miles east of manhattan, has reached another crisis point. for nearly two decades, ms-13, a gang with roots in los angeles and el salvador, has been terrorizing the town, the authorities say, especially its young people. since 2009, its members have been accused of at least 14 murders, court and police records show.school officials are scrambling. police officers are searching. students are frightened. parents are anguished. it s so hard, i m hurting,  eveylyn rodriguez, the mother of kayla, said last week.  i wish i could hold my daughter again. in her first interview since kayla s funeral, ms. rodriguez spoke measuredly about how her daughter had been bullied by gang members inside and outside of her high school. to me, it s worse than it was before; it s everywhere,  said ms. rodriguez, a 1987 graduate of brentwood ross high school, where her daughter was a student.  this is ridiculous,  she added.  we need some type of assistance to help our police officers here and see if they can come together to figure out a plan to make things better for the kids now. the path to such a plan, however, runs through a fractured suffolk county. its former police chief is headed to jail, its district attorney is under federal investigation and a justice department settlement mandated changes in the police department in 2013 after findings of bias against latino residents.tensions simmer here because some residents say they believe an increase in central american migrants to town has led to the increase in gang violence. according to 2014 census figures compiled by queens college, brentwood s population is 68 percent latino or hispanic, with more than 17,000 residents claiming to be from el salvador.brentwood has 4,400 high school students divided into two schools, and administrators say the environment is safe. gang members rarely present themselves in the schools,  richard loeschner, the principal of brentwood ross high school, said.  if they do, we take care of that pretty quickly. but ultimately, he said, after acknowledging that the administration knew of about 20 to 25 students in the district with possible gang affiliations, there is only so much they can do. we can t exclude a kid because we suspect they are in a gang,  mr. loeschner said.  that s state and federal law that they are entitled to an education. even before the girls  murders, students were subject to random screenings with metal detectors, which have increased over the past few weeks, he added. there are no detectors at the entrances of either high school, however.some parents were concerned that the school s response to the violence was not proactive enough. dr. levi mcintyre, the school superintendent, sent an email to parents warning their children not to wear royal blue, the color identified with ms-13, or clothes displaying the salvadoran flag. a student on the way to school, he wrote, recently had his blue shirt torn off by gang members and burned.ms-13 formed in los angeles in the 1980s by immigrants from el salvador escaping civil war. the abbreviation stands for mara salvatrucha, which roughly translates to  salvadoran street posse. authorities say it has been in suffolk county since around 1998, and is organized in cliques bearing names like the brentwood locos salvatruchas. leaders gather to discuss their lines of business   extortion, prostitution, robbery, drug dealing   and to authorize the killings of chavalas, or members of rival gangs like the bloods and crips, court papers say.the recent murders have exacerbated disputes in the town over immigration policy, which donald j. trump, the republican candidate for president, fueled during last week s debate by saying that the gangs roaming the streets were made up of illegal immigrants. there s been a huge influx, to be honest with you,  said ray mayo, the president of the brentwood association of concerned citizens, who added that he was upset over undocumented immigrants crowding rental properties.  it seems like a whole new set of gang members who have stirred the pot up. two law enforcement authorities, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing murder investigation, said that over the last several years the gang has sought to enlist recent immigrants from central america because they are often more vulnerable to recruitment. for entire story: nyt s ",1
" an australian mother of three escaped the death penalty on wednesday after a malaysian court found her not guilty of drug trafficking.  maria elvira pinto exposto, 54, was found with more than 1 kg of methamphetamine in her backpack while in transit in kuala lumpur enroute to melbourne from shanghai in december 2014. under malaysian law, anyone found guilty of possessing more than 50 grams of illegal drugs is considered a trafficker and faces a mandatory death penalty.  the law was amended last month to do away with the mandatory death sentence, allowing judges to use their own discretion. but the changes have not yet come into effect. exposto s lawyers said she was the victim of an internet romance scam and was lured into carrying a bag containing drugs unknowingly by a friend of her online boyfriend, who claimed to be a u.s. soldier serving in afghanistan.   i agreed with the defense s argument that the accused had no knowledge of the drugs that were in her bag,  judge ghazali cha said on wednesday.  exposto s conduct during her arrest showed  she was naive and her behavior was that of an innocent person,  he said.  the judge referred exposto to malaysia s immigration department for deportation.   i m happy now that i m free,  exposto said in brief comments to reporters.  three australian nationals have been executed by malaysia for drug trafficking: kevin barlow and brian chambers in 1986, and michael mcauliffe in 1993.

"this ex-ice agent reminds us of how ridiculous jill stein s  cherry-picked  3 state vote recount effort really is. meanwhile, the left and the leftist media completely ignore states like ca, where illegal aliens rioted against trump and anyone who supported him, before and after the election over fear of deportation or loss of taxpayer funded benefits. ca was largely responsible for hillary s slight edge in the popular vote. without california s lopsided votes for hillary, trump would have won the popular vote by a large margin.a california state bill was just signed in to law in october, 2015, by gov. jerry brown, that registers and allows illegal aliens to vote in us elections. the motor voter act (a.b.1461) automatically registers residents of california to vote at the dmv. according to the law and a report by the washington times, the new motor voter act automatically registers to vote all eligible voters when they obtain or renew their drivers licenses at the department of motor vehicles instead of requiring them to fill out a form. the goal is to ease barriers to voting, but election-integrity advocates warn that the measure could inadvertently add millions of illegal voters to the rolls given that california allows undocumented aliens to obtain drivers licenses.   california state officials are praising the law and alex padilla, california s secretary of state says,  citizens should not be required to opt in to their fundamental right to vote.  we do not have to opt in to other rights, such as free speech or due process.  the right to vote should be no different.  state assemblywoman lorena gonzalez from san diego said,  this bill will lead to millions more registered california voters, which means more people we can talk to. critics of the law have called it for what it really is.  absolute and complete voter fraud and corruption on a grand scale.  stephen frank from california political review issued a statement saying,  a.b. 1461 assures corruption of our elections.  our elections will look like those of mexico and other corrupt nations and honest people will stop voting, since illegals will out vote them.   linda paine of the elections integrity project says,  citizens must oppose this treasonous attempt to turn california into a form of government that gives control to non-citizens. -raw conservativewhen trump tweeted about illegal aliens affecting the outcome of the vote, specifically in ca, politfact was quick to accuse him of being dishonest:grabbing the attention of the golden state, president-elect donald trump claimed in a recent tweet there was  serious voter fraud  in three states won by hillary clinton during the general election, including california.trump made this claim on sunday during a flood of tweets about voter fraud. the president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for  the millions of people who voted illegally.  politifact national examined that claim and rated it pants on fire.we decided to fact-check trump s eye-opening claim about  serious voter fraud  in california.our researchtrump offered no evidence about california voter fraud in his series of tweets. his allegations are completely unfounded,  california secretary of state alex padilla said in an interview.  i think it s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. if anything, a message back to mr. trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. but as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades. padilla s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it s received for this and past general elections.hillary clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over trump as of nov. 28, a margin that s grown substantially as california continues to count the state s many absentee ballots. broad brush allegations dean logan, president of the california association of clerks and election officials and the top elections official in los angeles county, said in a statement responding to trump s tweets, that the state has  a history of accurate and accountable elections. logan described trump s voter fraud claims as  broad brush allegations. logan added in an email to politifact california that:  quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track.  that alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other. he added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter s eligibility. but none were used before or after the election, he said. and i think that sort of goes to the point that there s nothing to back up those allegations,  logan said.trump s unsupported claim about voter fraud in california may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: ab 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver s licenses; and the new motor voter act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver s license.  politifact ca",1
" egypt summoned several western ambassadors on sunday in protest against a statement criticizing the country s detention of a human rights lawyer who was helping investigate the case of a murdered italian student.  germany, italy, the netherlands, britain and canada issued a statement late on friday critical of the detention of ibrahim metwaly, who was helping investigate the murder of giulio regeni. the phd student s body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the egyptian capital in 2016 showing signs of extensive torture. an egyptian foreign ministry statement said the german, dutch and italian ambassadors had been summoned and that procedures to summon the british and canadian ambassadors were ongoing.  the ministry said the criticism from the five western countries was  a blatant and unacceptable interference in domestic affairs and the work of the judiciary.        it is unfortunate that such a statement would be issued from countries that call for respecting rule of law and the principles of separation of powers,  it said.  metwaly founded the association of the families of the disappeared after his son disappeared four years ago. he was taken by airport security in september while heading to geneva to attend a u.n. conference on enforced disappearances, members of his group said.  they later said a state prosecutor had ordered his detention.  judicial sources told reuters on saturday that metwaly was detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre trial detention was in accordance with the law. rights activists say egyptian authorities kidnap dissent and keep them in secret jails without charges. egypt denies the accusations.

" puerto rico’s federally appointed financial oversight board said on friday it will institute a two day per month work furlough for government employees, but a defiant governor ricardo rossello rejected the measure out of hand. the plan, which originally envisioned a four day per month furlough, is set to begin on sept. 1 and last throughout the 2018 fiscal year in an effort to achieve $218 million in savings. it excludes frontline law enforcement personnel. rossello openly challenged the board’s authority to impose the belt tightening measure on the bankrupt u.s. territory, however. the furloughs are part of the board’s efforts to implement fiscal changes and achieve $880 million in savings for “right sizing” the government this fiscal year and ensuring the island’s long term economic viability. natalie jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said the government had offered a number of ideas for achieving savings. speaking during a webcast of the board’s ninth public meeting, she said the government had fallen short of meeting required money saving goals, however. furloughs could be scaled back or eliminated early if sufficient savings are achieved per the government’s fiscal plan, the board said. rossello, in a televised address late on friday, said the furloughs were unjustified and unnecessary. he also highlighted, in a statement released by his office, public sector cutbacks and budgetary savings that resulted in higher than expected financial reserves. “i do not accept nor will i execute the furlough submitted today by the financial oversight and management board,” rossello said. the board was created by the federal puerto rico rescue law known as promesa. rossello said section 205 of the promesa law means the board can make “recommendations” but not impose changes. furloughs would represent a $340 million hit to the economy  in the current fiscal year, he said. puerto rico’s treasury secretary, raul maldonado, told reuters on wednesday that preliminary tax collections in july, the first month of fiscal 2018, were running $20 million to $30 million ahead of forecast. but board member andrew biggs spoke of the commonwealth’s current state of affairs in stark terms during the meeting. “the simple fact is that the government of puerto rico has run out of money,” he said. he added that “the difficult steps of raising taxes and cutting spending” were something that the board and government alike “have no choice but to do.” puerto rico is seeking to restructure roughly $72 billion in debt and another near $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities while it struggles with the flight of residents to the u.s. mainland and a 45 percent poverty rate. reforms of the pension system were among the measures discussed at friday’s board meeting. they would include a 10 percent cut in benefits. for an adrift in debt interactive, click: here for a graphic on the mutual funds' puerto rico bankruptcy tangle, click: here ",0
" iran s continued detention of jailed iranian british aid worker nazanin zaghari ratcliffe is unacceptable, british trade minister liam fox said on tuesday, adding that she should be released as soon as possible. zaghari ratcliffe is serving a five year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment, and was brought into court on saturday accused by a judge of  spreading propaganda against the regime,  the thomson reuters foundation, a charity organization for which she works, said.  this is a very very aggressive, unacceptable way to treat a uk citizen,  fox said on bbc radio.  this detention is completely unacceptable to the british government, it is completely, in our view, illegal, and she should be released as soon as possible.  fox had earlier defended foreign secretary boris johnson after johnson last week said that zaghari ratcliffe had been training journalists in iran, which the foundation said was incorrect. the charges against zaghari ratcliffe are denied by her family and the foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of reuters news.

" american tourist nicholas burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. the problem is, the destination was north korea and a u.s. state department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on friday. burkhead, a 35 year old resident of virginia, was among the last american tourists to leave north korea, landing on thursday in beijing.  i was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to beijing from the north korean capital, pyongyang, before the u.s. travel ban kicks in.  it was very relaxing   beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. burkhead arrived in beijing on north korea s state owned air koryo after visiting pyongyang as well as the city of kaesong near the heavily armed border with south korea. his five day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). other americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as jamie banfill, 32, who had led tours to north korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the north for a decade, said the travel ban short sighted.  it s an extremely complex situation on the korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. the united states last month announced a ban on u.s. passport holders from traveling to north korea, effective sept. 1. journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous u.s. restrictions on travel to iraq and libya. heidi linton, director of christian friends of korea, who has been working in north korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  we started a hepatitis b program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    it was not immediately clear how many americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in north korea. an official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of u.s. citizens there. north korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern japan. the u.s. ban on travel to north korea followed the death of u.s. college student otto warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the united states in a coma in june and died six days later. the circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in pyongyang.    i was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  burkhead said. the state department declared u.s. passports invalid for travel to, in or through north korea. the restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. north korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. north korea is currently holding two korean american academics and a missionary, as well as three south korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  this month, north korea released a canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. hundreds of americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 western tourists who visit north korea annually, according to u.s. lawmaker joe wilson.

" turkey s parliament has approved the government s 2018 budget, which includes increased spending on defense and projects a rise in the fiscal deficit to 65.9 billion lira ($17.28 billion). the 2018 budget, approved by parliament late on friday, introduces changes in tax regulations, such as tax increases for companies and motor vehicles, to help pay for increased security. in 2017, turkey s budget is expected to show a deficit of 61.7 billion lira, more than twice the 2016 budget deficit of around 30 billion lira. turkey s 2018 budget also projects tax income of 599.4 billion lira, up some 15 percent from estimates for 2017, and a 5.8 billion lira primary surplus. over the past two years, turkey s current account deficit has widened due to increasing government incentives to boost the economy and defense spending. next year s budget deficit to gross domestic product ratio is expected to be 1.9 percent. the government says the additional defense spending is urgently needed to modernize the military, the second largest in the nato alliance, and meet the costs of domestic and foreign security operations. turkey s economy has rebounded from a downturn that followed an attempted coup last year, helped by a series of government stimulus measures. gdp grew 11.1 percent year on year in the third quarter, its fastest expansion in six years, according to official data.

" white house spokesman sean spicer said on wednesday he had let down president donald trump with his “inexcusable and reprehensible” comments comparing the use of poison gas by syria’s president to the atrocities of adolf hitler. “i made a mistake. there’s no other way to say it. i got into a topic that i shouldn’t have and i screwed up,” spicer said during an event at a museum in washington. “on both a personal level and a professional level that will definitely go down as not a very good day in my history,” he added. spicer triggered an uproar at a white house briefing on tuesday while discussing chemical weapons use by the government of syrian president bashar al assad, saying that even hitler did not use chemical weapons during world war two. the comments drew sharp criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that the nazis killed  millions of jews and others in gas chambers. eighty seven people, including children, were killed in last week’s chemical weapons attack in syria.  offered a chance to clarify his remarks during tuesday’s briefing, spicer attempted to draw a distinction between the two different uses of deadly chemicals. later on tuesday, he apologized for his handling of the topic, which came on the jewish holiday of passover and as christians prepare to celebrate easter. on wednesday, spicer said the comments were “inexcusable and reprehensible” and all the more painful because they were made at a time sacred to jews and christians. he said it also was disappointing from a professional standpoint, especially after what he said were “an unbelievable couple of weeks” of trump’s presidency. he noted that trump had bombed a syrian air base in a forceful response to chemical weapons use by assad’s government and said trump’s hosting of chinese president xi jinping last week had produced “tremendous progress.” “your job as the spokesperson is to help amplify the president’s actions and accomplishments,” spicer said. “and when you’re distracting from that message of accomplishment ... it’s disappointing because i think i’ve let the president down.” ",0
" president elect donald trump laid out a u.s. military policy on tuesday that would avoid interventions in foreign conflicts and instead focus heavily on defeating the islamic state militancy. in the latest stop on a “thank you” tour of states critical to his nov. 8 election win, trump introduced his choice for defense secretary, general james mattis, to a large crowd in this city near the fort bragg military base, which has deployed soldiers to 90 countries around the world. “we will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn’t be involved with,” trump said. “instead, our focus must be on defeating terrorism and destroying isis, and we will.” trump’s rhetoric was similar to what he said during the election campaign when he railed against the war in iraq. in fayetteville, he vowed a strong rebuilding of the u.s. military, which he suggested has been stretched too thin. instead of investing in wars, he said, he would spend money to build up america’s aging roads, bridges and airports. even so, trump said he wants to boost spending on the military. to help pay for his buildup, trump pledged to seek congressional approval for lifting caps on defense spending that were part of “sequestration” legislation that imposed cut spending across the board. “we don’t want to have a depleted military because we’re all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldn’t be fighting in. it’s not going to be depleted any longer,” he said. trump said any nation that shares these goals will be considered a u.s. partner. “we don’t forget. we want to strengthen old friendships and seek out new friendships,” he said. he said the policy of “intervention and chaos” must come to an end. while u.s. armed forces are deployed in far flung places around the globe, they are only involved currently in active combat in the middle east, specifically iraq and syria for the most part. “we will build up our military not as an act of aggression, but as an act of prevention,” he said. “in short, we seek peace through strength.” trump described mattis as the right person for the job and urged congress to approve a waiver to let him take on the civilian position. under u.s. law a military leader must be retired for seven years before becoming eligible to become defense secretary. speaking to the crowed, mattis said, “i look forward to being the civilian leader as long as the congress gives me the waiver and the senate votes to consent.” “we’re going to get you that waiver,” trump said, returning to the microphone. “if you don’t get that waiver there are going to be a lot of angry people.” ",0
" three judges in hong kong s court of appeal are set to decide the fate of a former british banker who was jailed for life last year for the murder of two indonesian women he tortured and raped after his appeal hearing closed on wednesday.    rurik jutting, 32, a former bank of america employee, had denied murdering sumarti ningsih, 23, and seneng mujiasih, 26, in his luxury apartment in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders. the cambridge educated jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the asian financial hub. during the one and a half day appeal hearing in the former british colony, jutting s lawyers said the judge who presided over the gruesome trial last year had misdirected the jury. defence lawyer gerard mccoy argued that the judge had narrowed down the scope of the defence case by conflating an abnormality of mind with a psychiatric disorder. jutting s defence is that while a disorder can cause an abnormal mind, his mental state can be abnormal without a disorder. mccoy said jutting showed severe traits of psychiatric disorders, far beyond the normal range and was therefore not in control of his actions, said mccoy.  abnormality of mind is absolutely not confined to a disorder or a disease. here the judge locks it down, reinforcing to the jury it is disorder,  he said. jutting, dressed in a navy blue shirt and thick squared glasses, watched animatedly throughout the hearing and occasionally chuckled, particularly during the presentations by prosecutor john reading. reading stated that the previous judge had  exercised considerable care in crafting his directions on the law in consultation with both sides . judges michael lunn, andrew macrae and kevin zervos are to return judgement on the appeal which may include granting jutting the opportunity for a new trial, but they did not give a time frame.  deputy high court judge michael stuart moore said in strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial last year that the case was one of the most horrifying the chinese ruled territory had known. he described jutting as the  archetypal sexual predator  who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that it was possible he would murder again if freed. the jury unanimously found jutting, the grandson of a british policeman in hong kong and a chinese woman, guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in november 2016. jutting s defence team had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse, as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism, had impaired his ability to control his behavior. the prosecution rejected this, stating jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self control before and after the killings, filming his torture of ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies. in previous high profile murder cases such as that of nancy kissel, an american woman serving a life sentence for the  milkshake  murder of her merrill lynch banker husband, retrials have been given.  kissel lost her final appeal against her conviction in 2014.

" kansas sought on wednesday to avoid a court ruling that could force the cash strapped state to increase school funding by more than $1 billion. lawyers for the state and for public school districts faced off before the kansas supreme court in the latest chapter of a decades long battle over equitable and adequate funding. stephen mcallister, the state’s solicitor general, argued that while kansas may be spending less on education than some other states, student achievement is improving. “kansas is making excellent use of resources to do pretty well compared to the nation,” he told the justices. the state spends about $4 billion on schools, but lawyers for the four districts suing the state claim another $430 million to $1.4 billion would be required to meet the state constitution’s requirement for adequate funding.  “we’re falling short and we’re leaving massive numbers of kids behind,” said alan rupe, an attorney for the districts. he asked the court to declare the system unconstitutional and give the state legislature some direction on achieving constitutionality and a full legislative session to come up with a new system. the justices did not indicate when they might rule. the adequacy question comes after the court ruled in june that kansas had complied with its order to resolve inequities in educating students. kansas’ budget is feeling the effects of actions taken by republican governor sam brownback and the legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes in hopes of helping the state compete with bordering missouri and other states for business development and jobs. the state’s fiscal woes led standard & poor’s to downgrade kansas’ credit rating by one notch to aa minus in july.

" egypt defended on thursday a new law on non governmental organizations that three u.s. republican senators have called “draconian” and a sign of “a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent”. un high commissioner for human rights zeid ra’ad al hussein also criticized the law, saying it “effectively hands administration of ngos to the government”.     the law, issued on monday after being ratified by president abdel fattah al sisi, restricts ngo activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non compliance. egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. the government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. cairo’s foreign ministry denied the law aimed to restrict ngos and said some of them “have gotten used to working outside the law ... to defame the image of civil society in egypt”. in washington on wednesday, senators john mccain and lindsey graham said in a joint statement: “president al sisi’s decision to ratify the draconian legislation ... that regulates the work of non governmental organizations is the latest sign of a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent in egypt.”  mccain, who is chairman of the senate armed services committee, and graham said the u.s. congress should in response “strengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on u.s. assistance for egypt.” that sentiment was echoed by senator marco rubio, a member of the senate foreign relations committee, who said the law would have a “terrible impact” on egypt’s ability to make reforms and would have implications for u.s. egypt relations. “this law is a direct attack on independent civil society in egypt,” rubio said in a statement. the un human rights chief zeid said on thursday that the new law makes rights defenders even more vulnerable than before. “the crucial function of these ngos – to hold the state accountable for its human rights obligations – has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. this new law further tightens the noose,” he said in a statement. in egypt’s response, foreign ministry spokesman ahmed abu zeid said: “it is important to be vigilant about the intention of some civil society entities that have gotten used to working outside the law, and that were harmed by the issuing of the new law, to defame the image of civil society in egypt.”  egypt is one of washington’s closest allies in the middle east, receiving $1.3 billion in u.s. military aid annually. u.s. president donald trump praised sisi after a meeting in saudi arabia last week, saying the egyptian leader had “done a tremendous job under trying circumstance.” ",0
" white house adviser sebastian gorka, who was closely aligned with a nationalist faction led by ousted senior strategist steve bannon, no longer works for president donald trump, the white house said on friday. “sebastian gorka did not resign, but i can confirm he no longer works at the white house,” a white house official said in a statement. the official did not elaborate, but the statement suggested that gorka had been fired. gorka had reportedly feuded with national security adviser general h.r. mcmaster and was unhappy with the decision trump announced this week   backed by mcmaster and the u.s. military   to reorient u.s. policy in afghanistan. gorka, who frequently appeared on cable news shows to tout trump’s policies, was a divisive figure within the  administration, seen by veteran intelligence professionals and diplomats as an ideologue with little real world experience. he is the latest in a string of hawkish or nationalist advisers to leave the national security council and other parts of the white house in recent weeks, suggesting that in the battle among trump’s foreign policy advisers, internationalist voices such as those of mcmaster, defense secretary jim mattis and secretary of state rex tillerson are prevailing. earlier, the conservative federalist news outlet, citing multiple sources familiar with the situation, said gorka, a counterterrorism expert, had quit. in a letter of resignation, gorka expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the trump administration, the federalist said. “as a result, the best and most effective way i can support you, mr. president, is from outside the people’s house,” gorka was quoted as saying in the letter.  trump fired bannon a week ago in the latest white house shake up, removing a far right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti globalization agenda. “regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will ‘make america great again,’ have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. this was made patently obvious as i read the text of your speech on afghanistan this week,” he said in the letter. a u.s. citizen born in britain with hungarian parents, gorka worked as national security editor at bannon’s breitbart news website, where he often warned of islamic terrorism.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday said he is pushing to extend expiring healthcare benefits for retired coal miners by including a provision in a spending bill congress hopes to pass this week. in a statement on the senate floor, mcconnell, a republican from kentucky, said that in conversations with house of representatives speaker paul ryan he has insisted that the continuing resolution include “a provision to address that issue so these retirees don’t lose their healthcare benefit at the end of this year.” the fate of the united mine workers’ health care and pension funds is up in the air as congress weighs legislation to provide financial support for the soon expiring benefits, which are at risk of default as coal companies grapple with bankruptcies. although the senate finance committee in september passed a bill to provide funding for those benefits senior lawmakers are looking for ways to include the provision in the spending bill that has to be passed before existing government funding expires on dec. 9. democratic senators of coal producing states   bob casey of pennsylvania, sherrod brown of ohio, mark warner of virginia and joe manchin of west virginia   said they would block must pass legislation until congress takes action on the so called miners protection act. “there’s going to be 16,500 retired miners that are losing their healthcare benefits. there will be another 4,000 the first of next year,” said manchin on the senate floor on tuesday. “we’re fighting for those people that we promised, that we believe in, that have powered this nation, that have given us the country we have and now we’re turning our backs on them,” manchin said. manchin is due to meet with president elect donald trump later this week to discuss a potential role in the republican’s cabinet. trump had repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to put coal miners back to work. his spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on trump’s views on protecting miners’ pensions and health care benefits. grassroots group kentuckians for the commonwealth plan to deliver a 10,000 signature petition to mcconnell tuesday to call on him to pass the miners protection act, as well as reclaim, a bill that would offer financial support to help coal communities diversify their economies, before congress leaves for recess.

" czech president milos zeman has thrown his support behind a bid by ivana trump, the ex wife of u.s. president elect donald trump, to become the next ambassador to the country of her birth. “they could not send a better u.s. ambassador to prague,” zeman told her in a telephone call on wednesday, the president’s office said in a statement. ivana trump told the new york post last week she would suggest to her ex husband that she become ambassador to the czech republic. the 67 year old socialite, born in zlin in what was then czechoslovakia, told the paper the country was “where i’m from and my language and everybody knows me”. her suggestion, reported by czech media over the weekend, has been welcomed by other politicians but most enthusiastically by the president’s office, whose spokesman said on twitter it was a great choice. it was another sign of a sharp pro american u turn by the czech presidential administration. zeman was one of the few european politicians who vocally backed trump in his campaign for the u.s. presidency. after the real estate billionaire won the election in a surprise victory a week ago, zeman held a rare press briefing in which said he was “very happy” with trump’s victory and that the two shared opinions on immigration and terrorism. like trump, the outspoken czech president has often railed against “elites” critical of his leadership and has warm views towards russian leader vladimir putin. unlike trump, zeman is very keen on deepening ties with china. despite his country’s nato membership, zeman has often repeated the russian line on the conflict in ukraine and was not invited to the white house under president barack obama.  he has had an open feud with current u.s. ambassador to prague, andrew schapiro. in 2015, he “closed the door” of prague castle to the envoy for a time, after he made comments perceived as critical of the czech president’s decision to attend a world war two commemoration in moscow. the president’s spokesman, jiri ovcacek, tweeted last week that “a beautiful gift for my january birthday will be the exit” of the current ambassador.

" indian police are investigating whether 30 infants died for lack of oxygen in a northern state run hospital, the second case within a month in which medical supply shortages have been blamed for the deaths of dozens of children. an underfunded, poorly managed public health system is in the spotlight after more than 60 children died in august in a public hospital in northern uttar pradesh, amid accusations that oxygen supplies ran out because of unpaid bills. police launched an investigation on sunday in the latest case after a government report blamed the chief medical officer and doctors at another institution in the northern state, ram manohar lohia hospital, for the deaths of 30 children.   the infants died of  perinatal asphyxia  at the newborn care unit of the hospital in the state s farrukhabad district between july 21 and aug. 20, police said.  the probe officer was told by mothers that the hospital did not insert oxygen pipes (into infants  windpipes) after birth, and proper medication was also not given,  police said in the complaint, quoting the government report.  the investigation suggested that 30 of a total of 49 children died of perinatal asphyxia, police added in the complaint, seen by reuters. this condition is caused by a reduced level of oxygen in infants just before, during or after delivery, depriving them of the ability to breathe freely. a district magistrate on wednesday ordered the inquiry into the deaths of the infants, after media reports linked some deaths to oxygen shortages. he also ordered action against all the doctors involved in the deaths.  the district s chief medical superintendent, dr akhilesh agarwal, denied there had been any lack of oxygen.  the hospital saved 121 of the 145 infants admitted in critical condition following their birth elsewhere, he added.   the rest died since their conditions were critical,  he told reuters. nineteen more babies were born dead in the government hospital, and the six remaining, from the tally of 49 in the government report, died of unspecified causes, he added, without elaborating. india spends about one percent of its gdp on public health, among the lowest in the world.  successive governments have faced criticism for not reforming the overburdened public health system which is still plagued with a shortage of doctors and dilapidated infrastructure. in recent years, prime minister narendra modi s government has increased health spending and vowed to make healthcare more affordable.

" pakistan s electoral commission on wednesday barred from contesting elections a new political party that is backed by an islamist with a $10 million u.s. bounty on his head, a government official said. haroon khan, a spokesman for the commission, said a four man panel rejected the registration of milli muslim league (mml) as an official political party. khan said muhammad raza khan, chief of the election commission of pakistan (ecp), told mml s lawyer at the final hearing of the registration that the new party has links with militant groups and as such  we can t enlist you.  the ecp spokesman said the commission cited an interior ministry recommendation that the mml was  affiliated  with lashkar e tayyeba (let), a militant group blamed for the 2008 mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, and that such groups could breed violence and extremism in politics.   the united states has designated let founder hafiz saeed a terrorist and offers a $10 million reward for information leading to his conviction.  saeed, currently under house arrest, heads the jamaat ud dawa (jud) islamict charity, which washington says is a front for let. pakistan s reluctance to press charges against him has been a sore point in relations with washington and india over the past decade.  saifullah khalid, the head of mml, said his party would challenge the decision.  an attempt is being made to keep patriotic forces away from politics,  he said. the party is likely to continue operating unofficially, as it did last month when one of its leaders contested a by election in the eastern city of lahore as an independent candidate. the candidate, yaqoob sheikh, won several thousand votes, though officials from mml and jud ran his campaign. saeed s portraits adorned posters promoting sheikh. the move to bar the party appears at odds with what political and former military sources told reuters was a plan by the military s inter services intelligence (isi) spy agency to integrate militant linked organizations by bringing them into politics as part of a de radicalization drive. pakistani army spokesman major general asif ghafoor also said last week the integration of militants into the country s politics would be based on seeking a constructive role for the militant linked groups, although he did not comment on the military s role in any such strategy.   it is in my knowledge that the government has started some discussion over it, that is, how do we mainstream them,  ghafoor said.  neighbors india and afghanistan accuse pakistan s military of backing and using militant groups such as let as proxies, a charge the army denies. the mml is actively running a campaign for its candidate contesting another by election on oct 26., to be held in the northwestern city of peshawar.

" russia dismissed on wednesday as groundless a u.s. media report that said members of donald trump’s presidential campaign had contacts with russian intelligence officials.  the report, from the new york times, has boosted concerns about russia’s role in influencing the outcome of the united states’ election. u.s. intelligence agencies have already accused russia of being behind the hacking of democratic party emails in order to help trump, a republican, to win. u.s russia relations are under particular scrutiny following the inauguration of trump, who pledged in his campaign to improve ties with the kremlin after they deteriorated to their worst level since the cold war under the obama administration. the new york times, citing four current and former u.s. officials, reported on tuesday that phone records and intercepted calls show that members of trump’s campaign and other trump associates had repeated contacts with senior russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. “let’s not believe anonymous information,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters, noting that the newspaper’s sources were unnamed. “it’s a newspaper report which is not based on any facts.” in a rare comment to media, russia’s foreign intelligence service told the tass news agency the report consisted of “unsubstantiated media allegations”. russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova denied there had been any inappropriate contact between trump representatives and russian state agencies during the campaign. she told a daily news briefing the latest allegations looked like part of a domestic u.s. political tussle that russian officials have suggested is designed to damage the chances for better u.s. russia ties.  “we’re not surprised by anything anymore. this information once again proves that a very deep political game is playing out within the united states,” said zakharova.  the prospect of a swift rapprochement between russia and the united has lessened since trump’s inauguration due to scandals including the resignation on monday of national security adviser michael flynn, who was seen in moscow as a leading advocate of softer u.s. policy towards russia.

" president donald trump said on saturday he will move quickly to nominate a new fbi director, after he sparked a political firestorm by firing the man investigating possible collusion between russia and the trump presidential campaign. trump told reporters he might even be able to make his decision on who should succeed james comey to lead the federal bureau of investigation before he leaves on his first foreign trip on friday. “even that is possible,” trump said, speaking on air force one before departing for lynchburg, virginia, where he delivered a commencement address. “i think the process is going to go quickly,” he said, adding that the candidates under consideration were mostly well known. “they’ve been vetted over their lifetime essentially. but very well known, highly respected, really talented people. and that’s what we want for the fbi.” critics have assailed trump for abruptly dismissing comey, who was leading the agency’s investigation into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election, and possible ties between moscow and the trump campaign.. russia denies the claims and the white house says there was no collusion. trump made the remarks to reporters prior to speaking to about 50,000 people at liberty university in lynchburg, where he did not mention comey or the controversy his dismissal on tuesday caused. it was trump’s first public event outside the white house since comey’s ouster. a white house official had said 11 people were under consideration   including acting fbi director andrew mccabe, republican senator john cornyn, new york appeals court judge michael garcia and former assistant attorney general alice fisher   to replace comey as fbi chief. two new names, however, emerged on saturday: fbi special agent adam lee and u.s. district judge henry hudson. a source familiar with the process said attorney general jeff sessions and his deputy, rod rosenstein, had interviewed hudson, lee and five others on saturday. the fbi agents association, which claims more than 13,000 active and retired agents as its members, on saturday endorsed another candidate: former representative mike rogers, who had also worked as an fbi agent. at liberty, the nation’s largest christian college, trump peppered his remarks with the kind of anti establishment rhetoric that fueled his maverick presidential campaign, telling graduates to challenge “entrenched interests.” he thanked the crowd for their support and repeatedly invoked his own unlikely election victory.  “relish the opportunity to be an outsider,” trump said. “the more that a broken system tells you that you’re wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.” he also had strong words that seemed aimed at his critics. “no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can’t be done,” trump said. “nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they’re people that can’t get the job done.”  liberty’s president, jerry falwell, jr., was a key early supporter of trump during his campaign and helped rally support among religious conservatives.  trump, who has been preparing for his first foreign trip   one that will take him to the middle east and europe   also will deliver the commencement address to the united states coast guard academy in new london, connecticut, on wednesday.

"if you re not okay with taxpayers paying for exorbitant medical costs, including transgender surgeries for military members, you ll want to remember these names in 2018 a majority in the house voted down a proposal to restrict funding for transgender members of the military, standing by social policy changes enacted by the pentagon under former president barack obama.rep. vicky hartzler, r-mo., succeeded in forcing a vote, arguing that obama s  transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.  the attempted rollback failed on a 209-214 vote, however, as 24 republicans joined a unanimous democratic caucus in opposing the proposal. the obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from members of congress, is ill-conceived and contrary to our goals of increasing troop readiness and investing defense dollars into addressing budget shortfalls of the past,  hartzler said in june.  by recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. her amendment would have barred the defense department from  provid[ing] medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition  to members of the military. proponents of transgender military service argued that her proposal  would reduce military readiness  by discouraging transgender americans from serving. it would have a negative impact on morale, a negative impact on retention and move us away from the merit-based system which we now have, where we have one set of rules applied to everybody,  rep. jared polis, d-colo., who co-chairs the lgbt equality caucus, said wednesday.hartzler maintained that her amendment would increase readiness, however.  the deployability of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery,  she said.  this recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation s wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. it makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve.   washington examinerhere s the list of 24 republicans who voted to keep obama s transgender policy for our military in place that was implemented without input from members of congress:justin amash (michigan)jack bergman (michigan)mike coffman (colorado)barbara comstock (virginia)paul cook (california)ryan costello (pennsylvania)carlos curbelo (florida)jeff denham (california)charlie dent (pennsylvania)john faso (new york)brian fitzpatrick (pennsylvania)darrell issa (california)john katko (new york)steve knight (california)leonard lance (new jersey)frank lobiondo (new jersey)tom macarthur (new jersey)brian mast (florida)tom reed (new york)dave reichert (washington)ileana ros-lehtinen (florida)bill shuster (pennsylvania)elise stefanik (new york)claudia tenney (new york)h/t truth division",1
" u.s. senator elizabeth warren criticized equifax inc (efx.n) on wednesday, saying it failed to protect customers adequately  after a massive data breach and stood to gain financially from a hack that exposed information on more than 140 million people. “the breach of your system has actually created more business opportunities for you,” warren, a democrat known for her consumer advocacy, told former equifax chief executive officer richard smith during his second congressional grilling this week. in addition to providing consumer credit reports, equifax offers products to protect people’s data from misuse.  warren said this business mix creates a conflict of interest by making equifax responsible for protecting consumer data while allowing it to profit from consumers’ attempts to mitigate the breach.  “equifax is making money, millions of dollars off its own screw up and meanwhile the potential cost to equifax are shockingly low,” warren told smith, 57, during the u.s. senate banking committee hearing. smith retired from the credit reporting company last week but led it during the time of the breach, which it disclosed last month. smith conceded the hack created an opportunity for fraud, and the company could profit from consumers seeking to protect their data. but he defended equifax’s social utility. the company gathers data on consumers which it then sells to banks to allow them to better assess a borrower’s creditworthiness.  “the company has been around for 118 years and for most of those 118 years has done good things,” smith said.  following the hearing, warren told reporters that equifax’s new product allowing individuals to “lock” and “unlock” their credit reports does not provide sufficient protection and only a change in law can fully shield people’s information. “it only applies to equifax. consumers are now vulnerable to the loss of their data and some thief going through one of the other credit reporting agencies. that’s why we need to change the law. we need to make it in place forever and make sure consumers have control over their own data,” she said. wednesday’s hearing was the second of four hearings for smith this week as lawmakers scrutinize the breach. several lawmakers on wednesday also questioned why equifax had been granted a contract with the internal revenue service to help verify taxpayer data. speaking before congress on tuesday, smith repeatedly apologized for the breach, saying it took weeks for the credit bureau to understand the extent of the intrusion.

" an israeli ex soldier who serves as a spokesman for a group that documents alleged abuses of palestinians has set off a legal tussle with the israeli authorities by saying he himself beat a detainee. after dean issacharoff, a former army lieutenant, spoke of the incident in a speech uploaded to youtube in april, the israeli justice ministry took the unusual move of launching an investigation, with him as a suspect. issacharoff, the son of a senior diplomat, belongs to breaking the silence, a circle of army veterans that has long angered israeli leaders by publicising abroad what it says are   confessions of war crimes in occupied palestinian territory. the group portrayed as another example of israeli military excess issacharoff s account of what he said was his own beating of a palestinian stone thrower in the west bank town of hebron while trying to handcuff him in 2014. but the justice ministry last week declared the case closed, saying questioning of the alleged palestinian victim showed the event had never happened and that issacharoff had made a  mendacious claim . on twitter, prime minister benjamin netanyahu celebrated the decision as  further proof breaking the silence lies and slanders our soldiers . issacharoff retorted on social media that the ministry had questioned the wrong palestinian   a man he had detained separately in hebron around the same time. breaking the silence issued what it said was video of the right incident, showing issacharoff frog marching a handcuffed man. the palestinian appears to have dark patches on his cheeks, which the group said were bruises from issacharoff having kneed him. issacharoff said he bloodied the palestinian, though no blood is seen on the detainee in the footage. achiya schatz, another breaking the silence spokesman,  accused the justice ministry of clearing issacharoff in order to discredit the group.  this was a politicised investigation, made to order for the elimination of opposition (voices),  schatz said. prosecutor nurit littman denied any bias and said  issacharoff s testimony had been too sketchy to produce corroboration.  we do not dabble in politics. we deal in evidence,  she told army radio, leaving open the possibility of a new investigation taking into consideration the new video.  interviewed on israeli television, the palestinian, faisal al natsheh, said he had been detained though he had not thrown stones, and had been beaten by troops. he could not confirm issacharoff was among them.  they didn t let me look at them, not even once,  he said.

" around 400,000 children are still displaced from the fighting for mosul, one year after the start of a military offensive to recapture the iraqi city from the islamic state, save the children said on monday. islamic state s self declared caliphate effectively collapsed in july, when u.s. backed iraqi forces re took mosul, the group s de facto capital in iraq, after a grueling nine month battle.  just because the fighting in mosul has stopped doesn t mean the humanitarian needs aren t great. if anything, children need our help now more than ever   those that are still displaced and those that are returning to see what s left of their homes,  said the london based charity s iraq country director, ana locsin.  large parts of mosul have been reduced to rubble; schools, homes, hospitals, roads, playgrounds and parks. i ve spoken to dozens of children haunted by their experiences, left with psychological scars that ll take years to heal,  locsin said in a statement. with the fall of mosul and other small towns in  the country s north and west, the only area still under control of islamic state in iraq is a stretch alongside the western border with syria, where the militant group is also in retreat.

" east timor president francisco  lu olo  guterres swore in the remaining members of the new cabinet on tuesday and urged the first minority government since independence to focus on improving living conditions and avoiding political upheaval.  the new administration led by prime minister mari alkatiri   faces pressure to lift flagging oil production in the nation of 1.3 million people, where unemployment and poverty remain rife. alkatiri, who was east timor s first prime minister after independence in 2002, stood down in 2006 following a wave of unrest sparked by the sacking of 600 soldiers. his fretilin party won the most votes in july s election but failed to get an outright majority.    guterres said in a speech at the presidential palace that the country expected good governance without waste.  the improvement of well being in our land isn t achieved with political upheaval. it s achieved with work, with the participation of everyone and with dedication,  said guterres.     dwindling output from existing oil and gas fields, compounded by weaker commodities prices, have hit the government s budget and crimped its ambition to develop manufacturing as an engine for economic growth. the former portuguese colony was invaded by neighboring indonesia in 1975. an often violent 24 year resistance movement took east timor to independence in 2002 and many of its key figures still feature prominently in running the country. alkatiri, who is a muslim in the predominantly roman catholic nation, spent several decades living in exile in mozambique during east timor s struggle for independence. nobel peace prize winner and former prime minister and president, jose ramos horta, was also sworn into the cabinet last month in a new post as minister of state and counsellor for national security. hernani filomena coelho da silva has been appointed to the important post of oil minister. he was foreign minister in the previous administration. australia and east timor reached a breakthrough agreement last month on a maritime border, ending a decade old row that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project. the dispute has led the owners of the greater sunrise fields   woodside petroleum, conocophillips, royal dutch shell and japan s osaka gas   to shelve the project. fretilin, which won 23 seats in the election, will join with the democratic party to control 30 seats in the 65 seat parliament.  fretilin, or the revolutionary front for an independent east timor, had been in a de facto coalition since 2015 with the national congress for timorese reconstruction, a party founded by former independence fighter xanana gusmao.

" republicans in the u.s. congress hope to convince president elect donald trump to support an untested strategy of using the tax code to promote exports while slashing corporate taxes, framing it as a way to fulfill his campaign promises to restore blue collar jobs. the plan would be one way to help republican lawmakers reconcile their long standing goal of tax cuts with the often populist campaign rhetoric of trump, who has attacked the north american free trade agreement (nafta) and other trade deals as bad for u.s. workers. critics say it risks running afoul of global trade rules and increasing costs for u.s. consumers. analysts also say that any export gains could be short lived if the strategy causes the dollar to strengthen, wiping out any price advantage for u.s. products in international markets. it is likely to undergo months of debate as part of a larger package of proposals offered in congressional republicans’ “a better way” economic plan, but at least one trump adviser already seems to have a favorable view of the export focused “border adjustability” strategy. “if we have a border adjustable tax system, that can solve a lot of these trade issues that trump is talking about,” economic analyst and trump adviser stephen moore said in an interview. “you’re going to tax what’s imported and not going to tax what’s exported. so we’re going to reduce the trade deficit and we’re going to have more companies come in here,” moore said. border adjustability’s details are not clearly explained in a summary of the “a better way” plan from house speaker paul ryan and house tax committee chairman kevin brady. but the tax foundation, a think tank that closely studies business tax policy, said the strategy would be implemented by making revenue from sales to non u.s. residents non taxable, while preventing importers from deducting the cost of goods bought from non residents. brady told reuters that border adjustability would “virtually eliminate” any tax incentive for u.s. companies to move operations overseas and encourage foreign investment to return to the united states. “we’ve got a great argument, i think,” he said. steven mnuchin, trump’s pick for u.s. treasury secretary and co author of the president elect’s tax plan, described tax reform on wednesday as “something that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency.” wilbur ross, trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, did not mention tax policy directly but said the trump administration’s aim would be to increase exports in part by getting rid of “non tariff” barriers. the perceived winners under a border adjustability approach would include u.s. manufacturers that export heavily, while large volume importers, such as u.s. retailers, could be hurt. that distinction was already dividing corporate lobbying groups.  while retailers support an overhaul of the tax code, “the tax on imports proposed in the house blueprint is cause for concern for retailers,” said christin fernandez, spokeswoman for the retail industry leaders association, a washington group. the industry group’s members include wal mart stores inc, home depot inc and target corp. some version of border adjustability could attract support from democrats. senator ben cardin, a maryland democrat who sits on the senate finance committee and the panel’s tax subcommittee, said he strongly favors the idea. but he called the emerging house plan “very, very questionable” because it would use tax on corporate income rather than a consumption tax. tax lawyers and other experts have said such an approach risks violating long standing world trade rules that allow countries to adjust their trading positions through indirect taxes, such as a sales tax, but not with direct taxes like the u.s. corporate tax.      “it would lead to uncertainty on how it would be treated internationally. and that’s bad for business,” cardin told reuters.      trump’s transition team and other trump advisors on the economy did not respond to requests for comment. brady has said border adjustability would pass muster with the world trade organization, which polices global trade. the wto declined to comment on the plan. border adjustability is only one component of the “a better way” blueprint. it would also slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent; repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax; and let businesses write off capital investments immediately. altogether, the house republicans’ corporate tax plan would reduce u.s. corporate tax revenues by about $891 billion over 10 years, estimated the non partisan tax policy center, perpetuating a long term decline in the corporate tax take. combined with an equally ambitious package of individual income tax cut proposals put forward in the “better way” package, the republican plan would boost the federal deficit by about $3.7 trillion over a decade, the center estimated. advocates of border adjustability note that u.s. trading partners including china use value added taxes to favor exports over imports and say the house proposal would level the playing field for u.s. companies.  but some tax experts have questioned how effective it would be. kyle pomerleau and stephen entin of the tax foundation wrote in june that the increased demand abroad for cheaper u.s. made goods would boost the dollar’s value and cancel out gains for exporters. still, supporters of the plan believe it could win the favor of the president elect, who has railed against u.s. companies that have shifted production abroad and scaled back u.s. operations. trump has already ruled out u.s. participation in the ambitious trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade deal and has vowed to renegotiate or quit nafta. “when trump understands how the blueprint works, particularly the border adjustability provision, which will create a huge incentive to make stuff in the united states, i think he’ll be delirious,” said ken kies, one of washington’s most influential corporate tax lobbyists. kies represents major firms including microsoft corp, general electric co, pfizer inc and caterpillar inc.  comparison of corporate tax plan: tmsnrt.rs/2fe6mvs ",0

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of a draft united nations resolution calling for the united states to withdraw its decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital.  they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. well, we re watching those votes. let them vote against us. we ll save a lot. we don t care,  trump told reporters at the white house. the 193 member u.n. general assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on thursday   at the request of arab and muslim countries   to vote on a draft resolution, which the united states vetoed on monday in the 15 member u.n. security council. the remaining 14 security council members voted in favor of the egyptian drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the united states or trump but which expressed  deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of jerusalem.  u.s. ambassador nikki haley, in a letter to dozens of u.n. states on tuesday seen by reuters, warned that trump had asked her to  report back on those countries who voted against us.  she bluntly echoed that call in a twitter post:  the u.s. will be taking names.   several senior diplomats said haley s warning was unlikely to change many votes in the general assembly, where such direct, public threats are rare. some diplomats brushed off the warning as more likely aimed at impressing u.s. voters.  according to figures from the u.s. government s aid agency usaid, in 2016 the united states provided some $13 billion in economic and military assistance to countries in sub saharan africa and $1.6 billion to states in east asia and oceania. it provided some $13 billion to countries in the middle east and north africa, $6.7 billion to countries in south and central asia, $1.5 billion to states in europe and eurasia and $2.2 billion to western hemisphere countries, according to usaid.  miroslav lajcak, president of the general assembly, declined to comment on trump s remarks, but added:  it s the right and responsibility of member states to express their views.  a spokesman for u.n. secretary general antonio guterres also declined to comment on trump s remarks on wednesday.    i like the message that nikki sent yesterday at the united nations, for all those nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the security council, or they vote against us potentially at the assembly,  trump said. trump abruptly reversed decades of u.s. policy this month when he recognized jerusalem as israel s capital, generating outrage from palestinians and the arab world and concern among washington s western allies. he also plans to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv. the draft u.n. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in jerusalem.  a senior diplomat from a muslim country, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of haley s letter:  states resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others.   responding directly to that comment on twitter, haley said:  actually it is when a country is tired of being taken for granted.  a senior western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, described haley s letter as  poor tactics  at the united nations  but pretty good for haley 2020 or haley 2024,  referring to speculation that haley might run for higher office.   she s not going to win any votes in the general assembly or the security council, but she is going to win some votes in the u.s. population,  the western diplomat said.  a senior european diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed haley was unlikely to sway many u.n. states.   we are missing some leadership here from the u.s. and this type of letter is definitely not helping to establish u.s. leadership in the middle east peace process,  the diplomat said. israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. palestinians want the capital of an independent palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  the first name that she should write down is bolivia,  bolivia s u.n. ambassador sacha sergio llorentty sol z said of haley s message.  we regret the arrogance and disrespect to the sovereign decision of member states and to multilateralism.

" robert mugabe would have rejected the role of world health organization goodwill envoy had he been formally asked, his spokesman said on tuesday, days after state media cheered the zimbabwean president s appointment. who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus named mugabe as a goodwill ambassador on wednesday at a conference in uruguay that both men were attending.  but the appointment was rescinded on sunday following a backlash from western donors, rights groups and opposition parties. last friday, the state owned herald celebrated the largely ceremonial appointment as a  new feather in president s cap , adding that mugabe, 93, had accepted the role. his spokesman told the same newspaper on tuesday that zimbabwe s sole leader since independence from britain in 1980 had only heard about the appointment via the media.  had anything been put to the president ... (he) would have found such a request to be an awkward one,  charamba was quoted as saying, citing zimbabwe s role as a tobacco producer.  the who cannot take back what it never gave in the first place, and as far as he is concerned, all this hullabaloo over a non appointment is in fact a non event.  charamba did not respond to calls seeking further comment. mugabe s critics were outraged by tedros  announcement, saying he was rewarding a man whose government had presided over the collapse of zimbabwe s health system. in geneva, who spokesman christian lindmeier told a u.n. briefing that there were  no fixed guidelines  for appointing a who goodwill ambassador, but that the director general or his deputies had the power to select them.  on tedros  decision to rescind mugabe s appointment, he said:  i think in terms of transparency we were pretty good. a, it was tweeted and b it appeared on the website with the statements immediately.  charamba said the fact that zimbabwe was a producer and exporter of tobacco, mostly to china, would have meant mugabe campaigning against a crop that underpins the economy. tobacco is zimbabwe s single largest foreign currency earner, bringing in an average $800 million annually in the last four years, according to official data.  to be seen to be playing goodwill ambassador in respect of an agency which has a well defined stance on tobacco growing and tobacco selling, that would have been a contradiction,  charamba said.  in other words, he was not going to oblige the invitation had it come his way anyway.  a western diplomat in geneva told reuters:  it was a mistake, apparently there were no preparations or consultations.   it seems the idea was cooked up in a small group in uruguay. he acted quickly to rescind it, some would have waited.  but it will be interesting to see what the damage is,  the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

" planned parenthood, the u.s. medical services provider that could lose federal funding under the republican controlled house of representatives’ healthcare overhaul bill, said it would hold dozens of demonstrations outside the local offices of members of congress across the country on friday and saturday. the protests will target some of the 217 republican representatives who voted to pass legislation on thursday that would repeal and replace the affordable care act, or obamacare, the healthcare law passed in 2010 under former president barack obama. “we’re standing together as women, people of color, immigrants, and as people of faith, and we’re fighting back to make sure that every single politician in america knows that we will not stand for ‘defunding’ planned parenthood,” kelly robinson, the national organizing director of the planned parenthood action fund, said in a statement.  the bill still needs approval by the u.s. senate. president donald trump, a republican, praised the bill’s passage in the house but acknowledged that some of its provisions may change before it becomes law. a part of the republicans’ proposed american health care act would prevent planned parenthood from being reimbursed for any of its services, including cancer screening and pre natal care, through the medicaid program for the poor. about 60 percent of the patients who use planned parenthood’s 600 or so clinics are on medicaid or other federal public health programs. republican congressional offices from coast to coast were targeted on friday, with protests planned at the offices of representatives rodney frelinghuysen in morristown, new jersey, kevin yoderice in shawnee mission, kansas, and darrell issa in vista, california, among others. many republicans oppose any funding for planned parenthood, citing religious grounds, because its services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law. the family research council, a christian advocacy group, and other conservative policy groups praised the house bill as a tool to help limit access to abortions. planned parenthood says the bill would harm 2.5 million people who rely on it for basic health services.

" a draft of the statement to be issued after a southeast asian summit makes no mention of the exodus of rohingya muslims from  myanmar s rakhine state following a military crackdown that has been described by the united nations as ethnic cleansing. one paragraph of the communique, seen by reuters on monday, mentions the importance of humanitarian relief provided for victims of natural disasters in vietnam and a recent urban battle with islamist militants in the philippines, as well as  affected communities  in northern rakhine state. the statement was drawn up by the philippines, current chair of the 10 member association of southeast asian nations (asean)   which includes myanmar   whose leaders met for a plenary session in manila on monday. the draft did not give any details of the situation in northern rakhine or use the term rohingya for the persecuted muslim minority, which myanmar leader aung san suu kyi has asked foreign leaders to avoid. the government in mostly buddhist myanmar regards the rohingya as illegal migrants from bangladesh and does not recognize the term. well over 600,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh to find shelter in refugee camps after military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by rohingya militants on security posts on aug. 25. the plight of the rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion suu kyi to be stripped of the nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the myanmar military s actions. in september, u.n. secretary general antonio guterres said the situation in rakhine was best described as ethnic cleansing. some members of asean, particularly muslim majority malaysia, have voiced concern. however, in keeping with asean s principle of non interference in the internal affairs of one another, the issue appears to have been put aside at the summit. in september, malaysia disavowed a statement issued by the philippines on behalf of asean s foreign ministers as misrepresenting  the reality  because it did not identify the rohingya as an affected community in rakhine state. suu kyi, who did not mention the crisis in a speech after arriving in manila on sunday, criticized asean s principle of non interference herself in 1999 when she was fighting for democracy in a country then ruled by a military junta.  this policy of non interference is just an excuse for not helping,  she wrote in an opinion column in the thai daily the nation at the time.  in this day and age, you cannot avoid interference in the matters of other countries.  roberto romulo, a former philippine foreign minister, told the philippine news channel anc that there appeared to be no discussion about the rohingya at the asean summit.  they re treating with a great deal of respect a discredited nobel peace prize winner like aung san suu kyi,  he said. amnesty international philippines representative wilnor papa told anc that the asean leaders would talk about  terrorism and peace and order ... but there are a whole lot of elephants in the room they won t be talking about, that people are trying to ignore.

" u.s. officials began taking fingerprints of asylum seekers in an australian run camp on the pacific island of nauru on monday, signaling that vetting of applicants for resettlement in what u.s. president donald trump called a “dumb deal” has restarted. australia agreed with former u.s. president barack obama late last year for the united states to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in much criticized processing camps on papua new guinea and nauru. in return, australia would resettle refugees from el salvador, guatemala and honduras. trump labeled the agreement a “dumb deal” in a tweet, but said he would stand by it. interviews with more than half a dozen detainees on nauru confirmed the u.s. homeland security officials arrived on saturday, with meetings with detainees beginning on monday. two asylum seekers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears of jeopardizing their applications to settle in the united states, told reuters by phone homeland security officials did not ask any specific questions. “it was not a normal interview, they just collected fingerprints and took my height and weight,” the iranian refugee told reuters. other refugees showed reuters appointment slips to meet u.s. officials. similar biometric data collection would begin at the australian run detention center in papua new guinea in early april, detainees were told by immigration officials last week. australia maintains a strict policy of not allowing anyone who tries to reach the country by boat to settle there, instead detaining them in the camps on nauru and png in conditions that have been harshly criticized by rights groups. some asylum seekers have spent years in the camps, with numerous reports of sexual abuse and self harm among detainees, including children. one 36 year old woman told reuters by phone from nauru she did not want to be too hopeful about resettlement. “for me, i really don’t believe anything (about) when i get out from this hell,” she said. “i heard too many lies like this in this three and half years.” a spokeswoman for australian immigration minister peter dutton declined to comment. the department of homeland security did not respond to a request for comment. the u.s. security interviews with asylum seekers on nauru were canceled last month amid uncertainty about what constituted “extreme vetting” trump promised to apply to the 1,250 refugees it agreed to accept.      some asylum seekers said the latest developments gave them hope. “i think the deal will happen, but the question we don’t know is how many people will be taken by the u.s.,” behrouz boochani, an iranian refugee held on png’s manus island for nearly four years, told reuters. with mounting international pressure, officials at manus island center are increasing pressure on asylum seekers to return to their home countries voluntarily, including offering large sums of money.

" u.s. president elect donald trump aims to replace obamacare with a plan that would envisage “insurance for everybody,” he said in an interview with the washington post published on sunday night. trump did not give the newspaper specifics about his proposals to replace democratic president barack obama’s signature health insurance law, but said the plan was nearly finished and he was ready to unveil it alongside the leaders of the republican controlled congress. the republican president elect takes office on friday. “it’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. we haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” trump told the post, adding he was waiting for his nominee for health and human services secretary, tom price, to be confirmed. the plan, he said, would include “lower numbers, much lower deductibles,” without elaborating. “we’re going to have insurance for everybody,” trump said. “there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. that’s not going to happen with us.” trump was also quoted as saying in the interview that he would target pharmaceutical companies over drug pricing and insist they negotiate directly with the medicare and medicaid government health plans for the elderly and poor. u.s. house republicans won passage on friday of a measure starting the process of dismantling the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, despite concerns about not having a ready replacement and the potential financial cost of repealing the law. with the vote, republicans began delivering on their promise to end obamacare, also a campaign pledge of trump, who has called the program a “disaster.” the law, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people, has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system. republicans have called obamacare federal government overreach and have sought to undermine it in congress and the courts since it was passed by democratic majorities in the house and senate in 2010. democrats say obamacare has allowed growing numbers of americans to get medical insurance and helped slow the rise in healthcare spending.

" the european union s executive may trigger a process on wednesday to begin to strip poland of its voting rights in the bloc, officials say, as months of tensions between brussels and warsaw come to a head. in what would be an unprecedented move, the european commission could invoke article 7 of the european union s founding lisbon treaty to punish warsaw for breaking its rules on human rights and democratic values.  unless the polish government postpones these court reforms, we will have no choice but to trigger article 7,  said a senior eu official before a commission meeting on wednesday, where poland s reforms are on the agenda.  poland s new prime minister mateusz morawiecki said in brussels last week that  the decision has already been made . the commission s deputy head frans timmermans warned in july that poland was  perilously close  to facing sanctions. such a punishment could still be blocked. hungary, poland s closest ally in the eu, is likely to argue strongly against it. but the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between warsaw and brussels since the socially conservative law and justice (pis) won power in late 2015.     the commission says poland s judicial reforms limit judges  independence. polish president andrzej duda has until jan. 5 to sign them into law.  if all eu governments agree, poland could have its voting rights in the eu suspended, and may also see cuts in billions of euros of eu aid.  the pis government rejects accusations of undemocratic behavior and says its reforms are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era mentality. following a non binding european parliament vote last month calling for article 7 to be invoked, the commission appears to have little leeway to grant warsaw more time to amend its legislation. the reforms would give the pis controlled parliament de facto control over the selection of judges and end the terms of some supreme court judges early. the council of europe, the continent s human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the soviet system.  the commission fears letting poland off the hook could weaken its hand, especially in the ex communist east, and risk damaging the eu s single market and cross border legal cooperation.

" u.s. president donald trump said on thursday that he and chinese president xi jinping would be focusing “very strongly” on the u.s opioid crisis, which he has declared a public health emergency. trump said shortly before arriving in beijing he would discuss as a “top priority” stopping the “flood of cheap and deadly” fentanyl “manufactured in china” when he meets xi. “every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” trump said in beijing, standing next to xi at the end of formal talks between the two. “today president xi and i discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,” he added. “a special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon   fentanyl   destroying lives by the millions. we’re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,” trump said, without elaborating. speaking later to reporters, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said trump and xi agreed to take new steps. “on the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the united states in order to save american lives,” tillerson said.  “the president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information,” he added, referring to xi. china’s drug control agency last week disputed trump’s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the u.s. opioid crisis was produced in china. opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. the centers for disease control estimated that 20,000 americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. american law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the united states, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from china. while chinese officials dispute these claims, beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.

" china s ruling communist party announced a new central committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies, at the closing session of the 19th communist party congress on tuesday, a course setting leadership reshuffle held every five years. the list provides clues to who will, or won t, fill top party positions during president xi jinping s second term. the party will announce its new politburo standing committee around midday (0400 gmt) on wednesday. the standing committee, which now includes seven members headed by xi and is the apex of power in china, is selected by the new central committee.  here are noteworthy names:   wang qishan, 69, the anti corruption tsar and current standing committee member, is not on the new central committee, ending months of speculation whether he would remain for another term and break an unofficial retirement rule of not taking a new position after age 68.  wang may still get a leadership role outside the standing committee, sources told reuters before the congress.   zhao leji, 60, head of the party s organization department, which oversees personnel decisions, made both the central committee and the central commission for discipline inspection committee lists, suggesting he may take over wang qishan s role as top graft buster.   vice president li yuanchao, who is on the cusp of retirement at the age of 67, is expected to retire from the 25 member politburo after he was not included on the 204 member central committee.   china s top diplomat, yang jiechi, 67, could keep his state councilor job or be further promoted to parliament or its advisory body after he made it back to the central committee.  if yang retires, foreign minister wang yi, 64 this month, and song tao, 62, minister of the party s international liaison department, are the top contenders for yang s job. both wang and song are central committee members.   veteran diplomat liu jieyi, 59, china s permanent representative to the united nations, was elected to the central committee and is expected to take over as minister of the taiwan affairs office, replacing zhang zhijun, who is retiring.   transport minister li xiaopeng, 58, the oldest son of former premier li peng, became a full member of the central committee. he was the lowest vote getter among alternate members of the central committee five years ago.   ten women made it onto the committee, 4.9 percent of the total, basically the same proportion as the previous central committee. there were also 16 delegates from ethnic minorities, three of whom are women.   china s top banking regulator guo shuqing, veteran banker jiang chaoliang and securities regulator liu shiyu, the three front runners to succeed zhou xiaochuan as central bank governor, were all voted onto the central committee. (this version of the story corrects the number of ethnic minority members to 16 from 15 in paragraph 12) ",0
" for months republican presidential candidates traded insults such as “dummy,” “jerk” and “loser.” then, party front runner donald trump repeated a supporter’s description of ted cruz as a “pussy.” with the contest for the party’s nomination moving into south carolina and the stakes rising, it is possible the most disparaging discourse of the nov. 8 election campaign is yet to come.  the epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. the harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the internet and on cable tv. trump, the billionaire former reality tv star, sent a new hampshire rally into a frenzy on monday when he repeated the term “pussy” shouted by a person in the crowd, effectively questioning cruz’s manliness. trump went on to win the state’s primary the next day, ahead of the third place cruz by a 3 to 1 margin. “it’s one of the reasons i won. you have to be yourself,” trump said in a television interview on nbc’s today show. trump later promised to clean up his foul language and to be more presidential.   history suggests the language could turn even more coarse in the run up to next saturday’s republican nominating contest in south carolina. it was there that u.s. senator john mccain of arizona was accused in 2000 of fathering an illegitimate african american child, and former massachusetts governor mitt romney in 2008 of supporting polygamy.  “these adults are acting like elementary children,”  leslie mcrobbie, a former fifth grade schoolteacher from new hampshire, said of this year’s republican contenders.   president barack obama, a democrat, this week spoke of the snark that characterized a republican race of the past when he recalled that ronald reagan was described by rivals as an “unshapely man” and a “yahoo” before his election as president in 1980. coming off the first nominating contests in iowa and new hampshire, the seven remaining candidates for the republican nomination are under pressure either to break away from the crowd or prevent others from doing so.  insults can foster that. former florida governor jeb bush, mocked more than once by trump as a “low energy” candidate, has since retaliated by tweeting that trump was “not just a loser,” but also a “liar and a whiner.” the put down was re tweeted nearly 3,000 times and “liked” by more than 4,000 users.   cruz, responding to trump’s decision to skip a fox news hosted republican debate, branded his rival “ducking donald” and sponsored a special edition filter on picture sharing app snapchat that featured a blond haired duck with an exaggerated pout meant to represent the real estate mogul. “when we create so much of the modern campaign around the characters that are running, and not on the subjects, the natural byproduct of that is calling people names,” said political scientist michael artime. artime said that while bickering and name calling have always existed in elections, this cycle has seen a notable uptick in the negative. “in the past, if somebody would’ve said what trump said the other night, that would have been a very damaging thing to their campaign,” artime said. “the kind of politics we get is kind of the politics we deserve,” he said.  while many have gleefully or indifferently watched as candidates hurled barb after barb, others have condemned it. “bullying can be highly instrumental and used for social climbing,” said bob faris, associate professor of sociology at university of california davis, who studies aggressive behavior in adolescents. “and it works,” he said, “provided that kids target the right kids.” for trump, perhaps the most blustery of the candidates, the target is constantly changing, his numbers remaining constant in the opinion polls while he assails rivals for being “stupid,” “weak” and “pathetic.” “he does look like a bully,” faris said. “donald is a whole new development. i can’t think of a candidate like him.” presidential historian mike purdy, however, cites a precedent in the late republican president theodore roosevelt. “roosevelt loved more than anything else to be the center of attention, and he had a huge, huge ego,” purdy said. “they both have a certain amount of ego. they both have trouble controlling their mouths,” purdy said, likening roosevelt to trump. purdy said roosevelt called his onetime ally william howard taft a “fathead” during the 1912 presidential campaign, and went on to say then rival taft, seeking re election at the time, had the “brains of a guinea pig.” neither won the race. purdy noted the attacks also came at the expense of substantive political discourse.  “they’re incredibly personal attacks, and they’re not just attacks just on somebody’s position, they’re attacks about personal characteristics,” he said. “that is part of the civility i think we need to recapture.” on friday, trump suggested he agreed. “i do this for effect,” trump said of his foul language in an interview with wor radio in new york. “as we get closer, you will be shocked at how presidential i will be. you will be very proud of me.”  (editing by richard valdmanis and howard goller) sap is the sponsor of this content. it was independently created by reuters’ editorial staff and funded in part by sap, which otherwise has no

" venezuela s opposition said on tuesday it will not join scheduled talks with president nicolas maduro s government, undercutting a dialogue effort that has been viewed with suspicion by many adversaries of the ruling socialist party. the government has eagerly promoted the talks amid global criticism that maduro is turning the country into a dictatorship, while the opposition has always insisted the talks should not distract from the country s economic crisis.  the two sides held separate exploratory conversations with the president of the dominican republic earlier this month. but the opposition said the government has not made enough progress on issues such as human rights to warrant full bilateral talks.  negotiation is not to go and waste time, to look at someone s face, but rather so that venezuelans can have immediate solutions,  opposition leader henrique capriles told reporters.   we cannot have a repeat of last year s failure,  he said, referring to vatican brokered talks in 2016 that fell apart after the opposition said the government was simply using them as a stalling tactic. the information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the opposition wants a date for the next presidential election, due by the end of 2018, with guarantees it will be free and fair. it is also calling for freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, a foreign humanitarian aid corridor and respect for the opposition led congress. with spain pushing for the european union to adopt restrictive measures against members of the venezuelan government, maduro may be hoping to dodge further sanctions. the united states has issued several rounds of sanctions against venezuela, primarily in response to the creation of an all powerful super body called the constituent assembly that was elected in a july vote the opposition labeled fraudulent. many countries have refused to recognize the assembly, which maduro insists has brought peace to the country of 30 million. he says opposition leaders are coup plotters seeking to sabotage socialism in oil rich venezuela under the guise of peaceful protests. amid a fourth straight year of recession, millions of venezuelans are suffering food shortages and rampant inflation, which the government blames on an  economic war  led by the opposition and fueled by recent sanctions.

" president michel temer said on friday that a bill overhauling brazil s costly pension system might not clear congress this year as planned, the first time that he has indicated that such a delay might happen. in an interview with poder360 news website, temer said the government had to again consult lawmakers in the government coalition, many of whom have already said they are doubtful the legislation will pass this year. the pension reform is crucial to temer s attempts to plug brazil s budget deficit and reduce the bloated pension system. but its provisions to increase the retirement age have made it unpopular with brazilians. temer put the delay down to charges in a corruption case that put his legislative agenda on hold for six months. the government is considering a watered down version of the bill, temer said, confirming previous statements from officials that it would be ready to settle for a bill that included at least the introduction of a minimum retirement age of 65 years for men, up from the current average age of 55. a diluted pension bill would also need to include a gradual transition to the new rules and parity between the public and private pension systems, he said. his chief of staff eliseu padilha, who also took part in the interview, said the government hoped a less extensive reform would still achieve 75 percent of the planned fiscal savings, assuming it included cuts to benefits for public sector employees. temer also said the government may issue a temporary decree to extend for a few weeks the refis program that allows companies and individuals to renegotiate delinquent tax payments.

" former fbi director james comey plans to confirm reports that president donald trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn’s ties to russia in congressional testimony, cnn said on wednesday, citing an unidentified source close to the issue. the senate intelligence committee said on may 19 that comey, who was fired by trump 10 days earlier, would testify before the panel publicly at some point after monday’s memorial day holiday. cnn said the testimony could come as early as next week. representatives of the committee would not comment on the report. after comey’s dismissal, news reports emerged that trump asked comey to end the flynn probe during a february meeting in the oval office the day after flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the russian ambassador. the account, first reported by the new york times, was based on a memo comey wrote after the meeting.  the comey memo caused alarm on capitol hill and raised questions about whether trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. cnn reported that comey has discussed the parameters of his congressional testimony with special counsel robert mueller, who has taken over the criminal investigation. it said comey planned to meet with mueller, a longtime colleague at the justice department and also a former director of the federal bureau of investigation, for a formal interview  after his public testimony. “the committee welcomes the testimony of former director comey, but does not have an announcement to make at this time,” said rebecca glover, spokeswoman for republican committee chairman richard burr.

" the u.s. congress passed a resolution late on tuesday calling on president donald trump to condemn hate groups after trump was criticized for his response to the violence at a white nationalist rally in charlottesville, virginia, a month ago. the u.s. house of representatives unanimously adopted the resolution, u.s. representative gerry connolly, a democrat from virginia, said in a statement. the senate approved the measure on monday. “tonight, the house of representatives spoke in one unified voice to unequivocally condemn the shameful and hate filled acts of violence carried out by the kkk (ku klux klan), white nationalists, white supremacists and neo nazis in charlottesville,” connolly said. the joint resolution, passed with the support of both republicans and democrats, will go to trump for his signature.  representatives for the white house did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment. the congressional resolution calls on trump to condemn hate groups and what it describes as the growing prevalence of extremists who support anti semitism, xenophobia and white supremacy. it also urges attorney general jeff sessions to investigate acts of violence and intimidation by white nationalists, neo nazis, the ku klux klan and similar groups. trump alienated fellow republicans, corporate leaders and u.s. allies and rattled markets last month with comments about the violence in charlottesville, where white nationalists and neo nazis clashed with anti racism activists on aug. 12. one woman, heather heyer, was killed and several people were wounded when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti racist demonstrators. the congressional resolution calls heyer’s death a “domestic terrorist attack.” james alex fields, a 20 year old ohio man who authorities say drove into heyer and other protesters, has been charged with second degree murder and other criminal counts.  on aug. 12, trump denounced hatred and violence “on many sides,” a comment that drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum for not condemning white nationalists.  white nationalists had gathered in charlottesville to protest against the planned removal of a statue of robert e. lee, who led the pro slavery confederacy’s army during the u.s. civil war. trump defended confederate monuments last month. at a rally in phoenix on aug. 22, trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath of the violence in charlottesville. “i didn’t say i love you because you’re black, or i love you because you’re white,” trump said at the rally. “i love all the people of our country.” the resolution also acknowledged the deaths of two virginia state police officers whose helicopter crashed as they patrolled the charlottesville protest.

" israel hailed u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as its capital on wednesday, but the palestinians condemned the move and said it diminished washington s role as a peace mediator. in a landmark speech in washington, trump reversed decades of u.s. policy in defiance of warnings from around the world that the gesture risked creating further unrest in the middle east. past u.s. presidents have insisted that the status of jerusalem   home to sites holy to the jewish, muslim and christian religions   must be decided in negotiations between the two sides. palestinian factions called a general strike on thursday throughout the occupied west bank, the gaza strip and palestinian areas of jerusalem and for rallies to be held at midday (1000 gmt) in protest at trump s move, raising the chances of violent clashes. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a pre recorded video message that trump s decision had made for a  historic day  and was  an important step toward peace .     he added that any peace deal with the palestinians would have to include jerusalem as israel s capital and he urged other countries to follow the u.s. lead by also moving their embassies to the city. he said there would be no change to access to jerusalem s holy sites.  israel will always ensure freedom of worship for jews, christians, and muslims alike.  but palestinian president mahmoud abbas said trump s move was  tantamount to the united states abdicating its role as a peace mediator  and declared jerusalem as the  eternal capital of the state of palestine . israel captured arab east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war. it later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital, a move not recognized internationally. palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state which they want to establish in the israeli occupied west bank and the gaza strip.  with this announcement, the american administration has chosen to violate all international and bilateral agreements and resolutions and it has chosen to violate international consensus,  abbas said. the move, he said, would serve  the extremist groups which try to turn the conflict in our region into a religious war that will drag the region ... into international conflicts and endless wars.  israeli palestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014. trump s adviser and son in law, jared kushner, is leading trump s efforts to restart them but those efforts have shown little progress. israel s west bank settlement building has been one of the main obstacles. palestinian islamist group hamas, which dominates the gaza strip, said trump s move was  flagrant aggression against the palestinian people  and urged arabs and muslims to  undermine the u.s. s interests in the region  and to  shun israel.

" u.s. president donald trump s speech to the united nations, where he warned he would  totally destroy  north korea if threatened, reinforced the need for pyongyang to realize it must give up its nuclear weapons, south korea said on wednesday. in a hard edged speech to the united nations general assembly on tuesday, trump mocked north korean leader kim jong un as a  rocket man  for his repeated ballistic missile tests.  we view the speech as portraying a firm and specific stance on the key issues regarding keeping peace and safety that the international community and the united nations are faced with,  the office of south korean president moon jae in said in a statement on wednesday.  it clearly showed how seriously the united states government views north korea s nuclear program as the president spent an unusual amount of time discussing the issue,  the presidential blue house s statement said. trump s speech  reaffirmed that north korea should be made to realize denuclearization is the only way to the future through utmost sanctions and pressure , it said. moon came to power in may on a platform of more engagement with north korea. since pyongyang s sixth and largest nuclear test earlier on sept. 3, however, moon has said the time is not right for dialogue. he and trump plan to meet in new york early on wednesday u.s. time, moon s office said. trump s most direct military threat to attack north korea was his latest expression of concern about pyongyang s repeated weapons tests.  the united states has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea,  trump told the 193 member world body.  rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.  u.s. ally japan, which pyongyang often threatens to destroy, has taken a consistently hard line on north korea, pushing for increased sanctions and pressure.   we greatly appreciate president trump s approach to changing north korea s policy stance, denuclearizing the country and calling on the international community, including china and russia, for their cooperation toward strengthening pressure on north korea,  chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told reporters. suga also welcomed trump s reference to a japanese girl who was kidnapped by north korean agents in 1977. the plight of abductees is a key issue for japanese prime minister shinzo abe, who has pledged to rescue them while in office, and an emotive one for the japanese public. north korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped 13 japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies. five of them returned to japan but tokyo suspects that hundreds more may have been taken.  north korea, which has conducted more than 80 missile tests under third generation leader kim, says it needs its weapons to protect itself from u.s. aggression. south korea and the united states are technically still at war with north korea after the 1950 53 korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. u.s. defence secretary jim mattis told an air force event on wednesday that the effort to deal with pyongyang was still diplomatically led even as he acknowledged the  somber reality  that the pentagon needed to have military options at the ready. u.s. ambassador to the u.n. nikki haley, speaking to cbs news, said on wednesday the united states had lots of military options on north korea that stop short of totally destroying the country, adding:  there are steps that lead up to that.   no one wants war, the president doesn t want war. we have tried to do this through dialogue, we have tried to do this through sanctions, we have tried every diplomatic measure that we possibly can. we re not giving up on diplomatic efforts,  she said.  the u.n. security council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on north korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month aimed at restricting fuel supplies and cutting off textile exports, a key foreign exchange earner. the united states has urged china, north korea s main ally and trading partner, and russia to do more to rein in kim, something trump appeared to allude to in his speech.  it is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict,  trump told the general assembly. china s foreign ministry, asked to respond to trump s comments about destroying north korea if it had to, said u.n. resolutions were clear the korean peninsula issue should be resolved peacefully through political and diplomatic means. the resolutions passed by the u.n. security council on north korea reflected the  common will and consensus of the international community  to denuclearization of the korean peninsula, ministry spokesman lu kang told a regular briefing.

" getting more americans to enroll for health insurance under president barack obama’s healthcare law known as obamacare is a top priority of his administration until president elect donald trump takes office on jan. 20, the white house said on thursday. “we would be focused on ... maximizing the opportunity that currently is available for millions of americans to go to healthcare.gov during the open enrollment period and sign up for healthcare,” white house spokesman josh earnest told a news briefing. sylvia burwell, the secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services, tweeted on thursday that nov. 9 was healthcare.gov’s best day with 100,000 sign ups since it began selling the 2017 obamacare plans on nov. 1. the government’s goal is for more than 13.8 million sign ups initially. trump has said that he plans to repeal obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act. insurers have said that 2017 obamacare plans will remain in place and that any changes would affect 2018 plans. earnest said that people should not worry about what could happen to the healthcare exchanges under the trump administration. “these are benefits that are available to them today. we certainly would encourage people to sign up and capitalize on the good opportunity that’s there,” he said. obama met with trump on thursday for the first time in a one on one, 90 minute meeting in the white house oval office.    trump also released a review of his goals to overhaul healthcare on his website, reiterating that he would repeal the affordable care act. trump’s pledge to repeal obamacare may not be easy. he does not have the votes in congress for an outright repeal and will have to cut away at its financing first, health policy experts say.

" observers found some technical problems but no evidence of vote rigging in kenya s presidential election last month, the european union said on thursday, based on random checks of tallies from polling stations. the finding was announced as kenya gears up for a re run of the contest between president uhuru kenyatta and challenger raila odinga on oct. 17, after the supreme court nullified  kenyatta s victory citing irregularities in the tallying process. credible elections would boost kenya s role as east africa s richest economy and a stable western ally in a region roiled by conflict. but problems with the vote could spark unrest: 1,200 people died in violence after a disputed 2007 election. bolstering the supreme court s findings of technical irregularities, the eu said in a statement it had examined  1,558 randomly selected scanned polling station results forms from 82 constituencies. a small percentage were unreadable, others had mathematical mistakes, and others were missing data or signatures. the country had nearly 41,000 polling stations and 290 constituencies.  odinga alleged that the original vote was marred by fraud and is threatening to boycott the re run unless some demands are  met, including the resignation of key election board officials.   but the eu said it did not find anything indicating deliberate manipulation of the vote in the forms it examined.  there was little variation in the patterns of anomalies ... and no obvious advantage to one camp or another.  however, the observers noted that more than a quarter of polling stations were severely late in posting their manually completed tallying sheets online. in some cases they only did so after the legal deadline for the opposition to mount court challenges to the results had passed, they noted.  the eu urged the election commission to use standardized forms with security features like serial numbers to reduce the opportunities for confusion in the upcoming polls.  it said the electoral board must do a better job of publicly explaining the processes it would follow in tallying the vote. in a separate development on thursday, ruling party lawmaker ngunjiri wambugu filed a court petition seeking to have chief justice david maraga removed for gross misconduct in connection with the annulment of the election.   chief justice maraga needs to be censured, i believe he has participated in gross misconduct, which is unprofessional. i believe that gross misconduct is trying to influence a presidential election,  wambugu told reporters.

" tens of thousands of muslims marched from the main mosque in indonesia s capital to a square in jakarta on sunday to protest against u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. it was the biggest protest in indonesia since trump s controversial move earlier this month to reverse decades of u.s. policy. police estimated the number attending the rally, organized by various muslim groups, at about 80,000. the protest was peaceful but rows of police behind coils of barbed wire held back the crowd outside the u.s. embassy in jakarta. a police spokesman said 20,000 police and members of the military were deployed to ensure security.   we urge all countries to reject the unilateral and illegal decision of president donald trump to make jerusalem israel s capital,  anwar abbas, the secretary general of the indonesian ulema council, told the crowd.    we call on all indonesian people to boycott u.s. and israel products in this country  if trump does not revoked his action, abbas said, reading from a petition due to be handed to the u.s. ambassador in indonesia. many of the protesters were clad in white and waved palestinian flags and held up placards, some reading:  peace, love and free palestine . there have been a series of protests in indonesia over the issue, including some where hardliners burned u.s. and israeli flags. the status of jerusalem, a city holy to jews, muslims and christians, is one of the biggest barriers to a lasting israeli palestinian peace. jerusalem s eastern sector was captured by israel in a 1967war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. palestinians claim east jerusalem for the capital of an independent state that they seek, while israel maintains that all of jerusalem is its capital.

" former libyan prime minister ali zeidan has been released after being abducted during a visit to the capital, tripoli, and held for nine days by an armed group, a relative said on wednesday. zeidan was prime minister from 2012 2014, a period when libya slid deeper into the political turmoil and armed conflict that has plagued the country since muammar gaddafi was overthrown six years ago.  he has since been living in germany with his family. it is not clear why zeidan traveled to libya or why he was abducted. he was being held by a group aligned with the u.n. backed government in tripoli, though he faced no judicial charges, a source said. the u.n. backed government has not commented on the case. tripoli is controlled by a number of the armed groups that have held power in the capital since 2011. some have been given semi official status by successive governments, but the groups remain unaccountable and involved in criminal activity. a lawyer for zeidan, moussa al doghali, told france 24 arabic tv channel that his client was released without explanation and that he did not know the circumstances of his arrest and detention. zeidan was in good health and was staying in a tripoli hotel following his release, doghali said.   in october 2013, zeidan was briefly abducted from a tripoli hotel room by an armed group allied to the parliament that sacked him just over a year later.

" the u.s. supreme court ruled on tuesday that a former police detective can sue a new jersey city claiming he was demoted as punishment after getting a campaign sign for his bedridden mother supporting the mayor’s rival in a 2006 local election. the court, in its 6 2 ruling, found that jeffrey heffernan, a now former member of paterson’s police force, was not in fact exercising his rights to freedom of association under the u.s. constitution’s first amendment because he picked up the sign for his mother and not himself. but the justices decided he could sue the city for violating those rights because the boss who demoted him believed, albeit mistakenly, that heffernan supported the mayor’s opponent. “we conclude that ... the government’s reason for demoting heffernan is what counts here,” justice stephen breyer wrote for the court. “when an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the first amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action ... even if, as here, the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee’s behavior.” the high court reversed a 2015 ruling by the philadelphia based 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals dismissing heffernan’s lawsuit on the grounds that a first amendment retaliation claim cannot be based on an employer’s perception of a worker’s actions. the day before heffernan was demoted, an aide to jose torres, paterson’s mayor at the time who was running for re election, saw heffernan getting a large campaign sign backing another mayoral candidate. heffernan said he got the sign while off duty as a favor for his mother after her previous sign had been stolen from her front yard, and that the sign did not reflect his personal preference in the mayoral election. the next day, the police department demoted him from detective and transferred him to the traffic division’s walking squad, a move he saw as political retaliation. justice clarence thomas wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing that heffernan should not be able to sue regardless of whether his demotion was misguided or wrong because he had not been exercising his constitutional rights.

" the world bank agreed on thursday to grant war torn yemen $150 million to help some of its hardest hit cities restore basic services and fight a cholera epidemic. an agreement signed by a world bank official and the united nations office for project services (unops) is funded by the international development association (ida), the world bank s fund for the world s poorest countries.   the new project will target issues like uncollected trash and untreated sewage water ... and also address access to electricity for critical services and urgent needs for road repair to improve mobility and access,  a statement issued by the unops said. civil war broke out in yemen in march 2015, between the iran aligned houthis and the saudi backed government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi. the agreement covers the houthi controlled capital sanaa and the red sea port city of hodeidah as well as the southern port city of aden, the temporary capital of hadi s government. some 900,000 suspected cholera cases have been recorded in the past seven months, including 2,200 deaths.  the heads of three u.n. agencies issued a fresh plea on thursday for the saudi led military coalition to lift its blockade on yemen, saying that without aid shipments  untold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die . one million children are at risk from a diphtheria outbreak and millions threatened by hunger, the heads of the world food programme, unicef and the world health organization said in the joint statement.

" former u.s. astronaut buzz aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, has been advised by doctors to stay in new zealand until fluid from his lungs clears, days after he was evacuated from the south pole as his condition worsened.  the 86 year old adventurer who was visiting the pole as part of a tourist group, was flown to christchurch, new zealand, early on friday because of congestion in his lungs. his team posted details of his medical evacuation from antarctica over the weekend, along with pictures of him in good spirits, on his official website as well as on twitter.  “i am being very well looked after in christchurch. i’m looking forward to getting home soon to spend christmas with my family and to continue my quest for cycling pathways and a permanent settlement on mars,” he said on his website. in one of the photos on twitter, aldrin can be seen reading a newspaper in his hospital bed as he tweeted: “catching up on the world while i’m stuck in quarantine.”  his manager, christina korp, who travelled with him to antarctica, posted photos on sunday of him taking a walk with a nurse inside the hospital. aldrin was a fighter pilot during the korean war before joining the u.s. astronaut program. on july 20, 1969, he stepped on the moon about 20 minutes after neil armstrong took the historic first step. their moonwalk, part of the apollo 11 lunar landing, was watched by a then record television audience of 600 million people.

" denmark looks set to become the next european country to restrict the burqa and the niqab, worn by some muslim women, after most parties in the danish parliament backed some sort of ban on facial coverings. full and partial face veils such as burqas and niqabs divide opinion across europe, setting advocates of religious freedom against secularists and those who argue that such garments are culturally alien or a symbol of the oppression of women. the niqab covers everything but the eyes, while the burqa also covers the eyes with a transparent veil. france, belgium, the netherlands, bulgaria and the german state of bavaria have all imposed some restrictions on the wearing of full face veils in public places.  this is not a ban on religious clothing, this is a ban on masking,  jacob ellemann jensen, spokesman for the liberal party, told reporters on friday after his party, the largest in the coalition government, decided to back a ban. this would effectively mean a ban on the niqab and the burqa, he added. around 200 women in denmark wear such garments, according to researchers. the three party center right minority government, its ally the danish people s party and the main opposition social democrats have all said they are in favor of a ban, though they are still discussing how the ban should be designed and enforced.  there will come a masking ban in denmark. that s how it is,  foreign minister anders samuelsen said on facebook. his party, the liberal alliance, had previously been one of the staunchest opponents of a ban, saying it limited people s ability to freely choose their attire, but has now aligned its stance with that of the other coalition parties, the conservatives and the liberals.  so if it is practically possible to have such a ban without betraying ourselves or our own values, then the liberal alliance will vote for it,  samuelsen said. the social democrats, denmark s biggest party, has also signaled support in principle for a ban on garments such as the burqa, which it said oppressed women.  we are ready to ban the burqa if that is what it takes ... but there are some dilemmas, not least with regards to how such a ban would be enforced,  said the social democrats  leader mette fredriksen during a debate in parliament on thursday. norway s government in june proposed a ban on face covering muslim veils in kindergartens, schools and universities.

" republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what u.s. vice president mike pence on thursday called their “last best chance” to repeal obamacare while a new analysis underscored how democratic leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase democratic former president barack obama’s signature legislative achievement. with no democratic support for the bill, republicans remain a handful of votes short in the senate, needing 50 votes in a 100 seat chamber they control 52 48, with pence casting a potential tie breaking vote. senator rand paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: john mccain, susan collins, lisa murkowski, dan sullivan, rob portman and jerry moran. asked whether the legislation will pass, pence said, “we’ll see. we’re close.” republicans, still reeling from their failure in july to win senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace obamacare, have set a sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. “this may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head america back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that’s based on individual choice, state based innovations,” pence told fox new channel. president donald trump has been pushing congress to repeal and replace obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. the current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. the non partisan congressional budget office has not yet assessed the bill’s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with republican leaning states benefiting and democratic leaning states losing. the nonprofit kaiser family foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on thursday that states that expanded medicaid under obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. the graham cassidy bill in 2020 would end the obamacare medicaid expansion, which many democratic governed states had carried out while many republican governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five decade old program regardless of how many americans qualify for its benefits. republicans have called obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. according to the kaiser family foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020 2026: new york (down 35 percent), oregon (down 32 percent), connecticut (down 31 percent), vermont (down 31 percent) and minnesota (down 30 percent). all are democratic leaning. the analysis found that six republican leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: mississippi (up 148 percent), texas (up 75 percent), kansas (up 61 percent), georgia (up 46 percent), south dakota (up 45 percent) and tennessee (up 44 percent). in total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is california, losing $56 billion. the biggest gainer would be texas, with a $34 billion increase. california, the most populous u.s. state, is democratic leaning. texas is the second most populous state and the largest republican leaning one. “it’s absolutely true to say the graham cassidy bill over time levels out on a per person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which i think resonates with most americans,” pence said. mccain, collins and murkowski were the three republicans who voted against the last republican healthcare legislation brought up in the senate, which failed 51 49 in july. paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on thursday went to twitter to underscore his criticism that the graham cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase obamacare. the insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the american medical association, american heart association and american cancer society, the aarp advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. more medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the graham cassidy bill on thursday, including the american psychological association, the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists and the naacp.  the center on budget and policy priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. the graham cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre existing conditions.

" france s president emmanuel macron told african youths on tuesday that he belonged to a new generation of french leaders who would build partnerships with the continent rather than tell it what to do. but a youth protest against him, stones pelting one of his delegation s vehicles and a botched grenade attack on french troops hours before his arrival in burkina faso s capital ouagadougou showed the hostility that still lingers after decades of an often tense france africa relationship. macron was also subjected to rowdy student questions at the university after his speech in ouagadougou, and was sometimes left fruitlessly hushing as he struggled to get his answers heard above the crowd. in his speech, peppered with references to african nationalists such as nelson mandela and burkina s revolutionary leader thomas sankara, macron promised a break with a past in which france often seemed to call the shots to former colonies.  i am from a generation that doesn t come to tell africans what to do,  macron said, prompting applause.  i am from a generation for whom nelson mandela s victory is one of the best political memories.  the 39 year old is on a three day visit to burkina faso, ghana and ivory coast aimed at boosting cooperation in education, the digital economy and migration.  i will be alongside those who believe that africa is neither a lost continent or one that needs to be saved,  he said. the grenade attack missed the french soldiers but wounded three civilians hours before macron arrived. no group claimed responsibility.  stones were thrown at a delegation convoy, however macron was far away from it at a meeting with his burkina counterpart, roch marc kabore in the presidential palace. dozens of local youths clashed with security forces in the center of the capital throwing stones. police responded with teargas. protesters burnt t shirts with images of macron and carried slogans including  down with new colonialism  and  french military out of burkina . it was not the first time a french president has promised to break with past french politics on the continent.  macron s predecessor francois hollande declared while visiting senegal in 2012 that  the time of la francafrique is over , referring to a shadowy network of diplomats, soldiers and businessmen who manipulated african leaders for decades after independence.  but it comes at a tense time, when french troops are being sucked deeper into a years long battle to quell islamist militancy in the sahel region.    france has 4,000 troops deployed there, and there are mixed feelings about their presence   highlighted in a bitter row between france and mali over the deaths of 11 malian troops being held captive by islamist militants in a french air strike.    the french are pinning their hopes on the so called g5 sahel force being set up by regional country s with french and american backing. it launched a campaign on oct. 28 amid growing unrest in the desert reaches of the region, where jihadists allied to al qaeda or inspired by islamic state roam undetected. macron earlier told journalists g5 had been too slow to get established.   he said he would call for greater co operation between europe and africa to tackle human trafficking and he touted a european initiative to rescue african migrants from being enslaved in libya. the exchange with heckling students was typical macron, who during his presidential campaign often managed to turn initially hostile crowds in his favor by answering questions head on.  you speak to me like i m a colonial power, but i don t want to look after electricity in burkina faso. that s the work of your president,  he retorted to one hostile questioner.

" the governor of kansas on thursday vetoed a bill expanding eligibility for medicaid for the poor under the federal affordable care act (aca) because the measure was not fiscally responsible and would still fund planned parenthood. state lawmakers in the republican controlled senate voted in favor of the measure on tuesday, just days after president donald trump’s efforts to repeal and replace the aca, also known as obamacare, ended with the bill being pulled from a vote. republican governor sam brownback said the bill also failed to eliminate waiting lists for disability services, did not add work requirements and was not budget neutral. “the cost of expanding medicaid under obamacare is irresponsible and unsustainable,” he said.  he added it was “unwise to undertake such a drastic change” to the state’s medicaid program while work on an aca overhaul was underway in washington. “i will not support this legislation that continues to fund organizations that undermine a culture of life,” he said, referring to groups such as planned parenthood, which provides a range of reproductive services including abortions. planned parenthood said in a statement that “the overwhelming majority of kansans” support the health care provider and the expansion of medicaid in the state.  the republican controlled house, which passed the bill last month 81 44, quickly took up a debate on overriding brownback’s veto on thursday, but a vote was postponed. “you are going to put a dagger right through the heart of our small communities,” republican representative leonard mastroni, who voted in support of expansion, told the house in topeka after brownback’s veto.  in the house, 84 lawmakers would need to vote in favor of the override for it to advance. the failed obamacare replacement bill in washington, pushed by house speaker paul ryan, would have ended the aca’s expansion of medicaid, the federal and state funded insurance program for the poor and disabled. kansas was not among the 31 states that in 2016 had opted to expand medicaid, with the federal government footing much of the cost under obamacare. with the aca’s enhanced federal funding, medicaid expansion in kansas, effective jan. 1, 2018, would cost the state an estimated $31 million in fiscal 2018, which begins july 1, and $67 million in fiscal 2019 with more than 180,000 additional recipients, according to estimates cited in a legislative report on the bill. without enhanced federal matching funds, the state’s costs would balloon to $465 million by fiscal 2019.

" pakistani private schools, charitable institutions, and religious seminaries are stepping in to supplement government run schools to help deal with the education needs of a fast growing nation with an estimated 50 million school age children. despite 220,000 schools nationwide, pakistan has over 20 million out of school children, according to a 2016 government report. the government has pumped money into schooling, with the education budget swelling by 15 percent every year since 2010, according to education consultancy alif ailaan. the united nations puts the current budget at 2.65 percent of gdp, roughly $8 billion, or around $150 per student.    but experts say the government can t meet all the education needs and part of the problem lies in quality of teaching rather than just dearth of money.  it s not the number of schools, it s the quality, the attitude,  said zeba hussain, founder of the mashal schools which educate children displaced by war in the country s north. situated on the outskirts of pakistan s capital islamabad, the charitable schools began when hussain met a group of refugee children while visiting the hills encircling the city.  many private institutions criticize what they describe as a deeply flawed government education system.   students are labeled  smart  or  stupid  right from the start,  said shaista kazmi from vision 21, a privately funded ngo that runs speed literacy programs for out of school children that compress five years of reading proficiency into one.  federal education director tariq masood strongly disagreed with critiques of teachers, adding that population growth and funding were the biggest challenges faced by government schools.   no one who is underqualified can enter the government system, there are fewer checks in the private system,  masood said.  masood said government schools adhered to a nationwide curriculum that was being constantly reworked and innovated.  the country s poorest often send their children to one of the thousands of religious madrassas (the arabic word for school) where students are boarded, fed, and given an islamic education. most operate without government oversight.  pakistan s madrassas have become synonmous with creating militant fighters through hardline teachings of islam and many have been linked to organizations such as the taliban and al qaeda.  but many provide shelter, three full meals, and a good education to young people whose families are unable to make ends meet.   in certain cases people send their kids because they can t even afford to feed them,  said irfan sher from the al nadwa madrassa, where all subjects are prioritized and students are capable of analyzing what they are taught.  sher insists that the country s future hinges on what its youth are taught.   the overall policy should be changed ... they should understand that if they want to change the country the only way is to spread quality education,  he said.

" the u.s. military said on friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on iran in support of president donald trump’s new strategy, which promises a far more confrontational approach to tehran. trump struck a blow against the 2015 iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. he also promised to address iran more broadly, including its support for extremist groups in the middle east. major adrian rankine galloway, a defense department spokesman, told reuters the pentagon was assessing the positioning of its forces as well as planning but offered few details. “we are identifying new areas where we will work with allies to put pressure on the iranian regime, neutralize its destabilizing influences, and constrain its aggressive power projection, particularly its support for terrorist groups and militants,” he said. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said his first goal would to talk with u.s. allies in europe, the middle east and elsewhere to gain a shared understanding of iran’s actions. “certainly we intend to dissuade them from shipping arms into places like yemen and explosives into bahrain and the other things they do with their surrogates, like lebanese hezbollah,” mattis said. the u.s. military has long been a strident critic of iran, accusing it directly and indirectly of trying to undermine the united states and its allies, including in iraq, syria and yemen. the tensions escalated in recent months in syria, where american pilots shot down two iranian made drones this summer.   still, a more aggressive approach to iran could trigger a backlash from iran’s elite islamic revolutionary guard corps (irgc) and forces that it backs. that includes in iraq, where u.s. troops are fighting islamic state and trying to keep their distance from shi’ite militia aligned with iran. “u.s. forces in iraq are quite exposed, and coalition forces are quite exposed to the risk of attack if iranian elements so choose,” said jennifer cafarella, lead intelligence planner at the institute for the study of war, a think tank in washington. the u.s. military is analyzing an explosively formed penetrator, or efp, that killed an american soldier in iraq this month. the reappearance of the device, which iran backed shi’ite militia routinely used to target american troops in iraq before their withdrawal in 2011, has startled u.s. officials. cia director mike pompeo noted the device was detonated in an area controlled by a militia backed by tehran. “we do not have evidence of a direct link to iran, but we are closely examining this tragic incident,” pompeo said on wednesday. cafarella said the killing of the u.s. soldier may have been a warning from iran. “i think it is possible that the iranians have been attempting to signal their commitment to retaliate against the u.s. strategy,” she said. mattis said the united states was watching for any new provocations from iran. asked whether he thought tehran might retaliate, he said: “it would be ill advised for them to attack us.” reuters has previously reported that options to increase pressure on iran include more aggressive u.s. interceptions of iranian arms shipments, such as those to houthi rebels in yemen, it could also direct u.s. naval forces to react more forcefully when harassed by armed irgc speed boats. the pentagon on friday detailed a series of major concern about iran, including its ballistic missile development and cyber attacks against the united states and u.s. allies.  the pentagon promised to review u.s. security cooperation activities with allies in the region, something that could lead to alterations in u.s. arms sales and military exercises.  it also signaled a willingness to re examine the positioning of the roughly 70,000 american troops the pentagon says are stationed in the middle east. still, mattis said: “right now we are not changing our posture.” ",0
" less than 24 hours after donald trump took office, his presidency started generating controversy.  photographs showing that the crowd at trump’s swearing in was smaller than at barack obama’s first presidential inauguration in 2009 caused the first ruckus in his administration   but not the last.  trump’s first year in office was colored by an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the russian government to affect the election outcome, insults and threats of war with north korea, and an effort to pass business friendly legislation.  from the start, the white house took a combative approach, accusing the media of framing photographs of the inauguration in a way that appeared to understate the crowd size.  press secretary sean spicer argued that the images were not what they seemed and that crowds of historic size watched trump take the oath of office. protests would become a hallmark of trump’s first year. on jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women jammed the streets of washington to demonstrate opposition to trump. a week after taking office, the republican president signed an executive order to prevent citizens of seven predominately muslim countries from traveling to the united states. known by critics as the “muslim ban,” protesters quickly demonstrated at airports in opposition.   trump would ignite protests again in august, when he was asked to respond to white nationalists marching in charlottesville, virginia, including one who drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters, killing a woman. the president argued there were bad people “on both sides.”  following his remarks, business leaders resigned from trump’s business councils and the panels were disbanded.     a defining feature of trump’s first year in office was the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with russia during the election. trump ignited a political firestorm in may when he fired federal bureau of investigation director james comey, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion by the trump 2016 presidential campaign with russia to influence the election outcome. russia has denied meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion. soon afterward, the justice department named former fbi chief robert mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation. paul manafort, who had briefly served as trump’s campaign manager, and his business associate rick gates were indicted by mueller’s team in october, accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. a month later, michael flynn, who briefly served under trump as u.s. national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations last december with russia’s then ambassador in washington just weeks before trump took office. trump has also found himself embroiled in a war of words with north korea over its missile program, exchanging insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un. at home, trump has struggled to enact sweeping changes he promised on the campaign trail.  he threatened to withdraw the united states from the north american free trade agreement (nafta), but business lobbyists persuaded him to renegotiate it. trump signed an executive order setting up talks on the trilateral trade deal, which has hit roadblocks with mexico and canada.     trump’s team also failed to repeal the affordable care act, known as obamacare despite republican control of the white house and congress. it was not until december that trump made headway on major legislative change as both chambers of congress passed a sweeping tax overhaul.  the bill must be reconciled with a different version approved by the house of representatives, but the senate bill is expected to remain largely intact.

" nearly 20 percent of high school and university students in indonesia support the establishment of a caliphate in the world s largest muslim majority country over the current secular government, a new survey showed this week. indonesia has in recent years seen its long standing reputation for religious tolerance come under scrutiny as hardline islamic groups muscle their way into public and political life in the young democracy.     the vast majority of indonesians practice a moderate form of islam and the country has sizeable minorities of hindus, christians, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. religious diversity is enshrined in its constitution.      the survey by a jakarta based organization polled over 4,200 muslim students, mostly in top schools and universities on java island, home to over half the country s population. nearly one in four students said they were, to varying degrees, ready to wage jihad to achieve a caliphate.  this indicates that intolerant teachings have already entered top universities and high schools,  pollster alvara, which carried out the survey, said in its report released tuesday.  the government and moderate islamic organizations must start taking tangible steps to anticipate this and be present in student circles with language that is easy for them to understand,  the report added. a presidential spokesman declined to comment on the findings.     hardline islamic groups late last year led mass street rallies against jakarta s former governor, a christian, whom they believed had insulted islam. they eventually succeeded in derailing basuki tjahaja purnama s re election bid in april this year, and he was subsequently jailed for blasphemy. the ruling was criticized globally as unjust.  groups like the islamic defenders front (fpi) call for sharia law to be imposed on the country and believe its leaders should only be muslim. the survey showed that the vast majority of students disagree with the establishment of an islamic caliphate and violence.      but authorities have repeatedly warned against the creeping influence of radical islamic thought among student organizations and in campus activities. president joko widodo and his government are trying to contain the rising influence of hairline groups, especially in universities and islamic boarding schools. a presidential decree banning any civil organizations deemed to go against the country s secular state ideology was approved by parliament last month. hizb ut tahrir, a largely peaceful organization that calls for the establishment of a caliphate in indonesia, was the first group to be disbanded under the decree.   president widodo has made several speeches at islamic boarding schools around the country emphasizing indonesia s diversity and the importance of national unity. in september, widodo called at a conference of around 3,000 university rectors  for the promotion of the country s secular ideology,  pancasila , in education.

" a possible labour green coalition narrowed the gap with the ruling national party in new zealand s final election tally, strengthening their position ahead of talks on sunday with the small nationalist party which holds the balance of power. the final sept. 23 election results released on saturday showed national won 56 seats and labour and greens together took 54 seats, leaving them both reliant on new zealand first s nine seats to meet the 61 seats needed for a majority in parliament in new zealand s proportional representation system. national lost two seats to the labour green bloc compared with preliminary results   a development which labour leader jacinda ardern said buoyed their position at the negotiating table.  we will continue our negotiations in earnest with potential support parties beginning this weekend,  ardern told reporters in auckland.  this now means that we have a strengthened mandate to negotiate and form a durable, stable coalition government.  ardern, 37, took over the labour leadership nearly two months before the election, quickly drawing comparisons with youthful, cosmopolitan leaders like canada s justin trudeau and france s emmanuel macron. she has almost single handedly brought labour to within reach of forming government. new zealand first said in an emailed statement that it would hold discussions on sunday with the national party at midday and with the labour party in the afternoon.  new zealand first leader winston peters told local media that knowing the facts  puts us in a better position to make judgements . peters has said he would only make a decision on which party to back after the final tally and after the results become official on oct. 12. prime minister bill english told reporters in queenstown that the final results did not change the nature of the negotiations, which would now likely focus on the economy.  i don t think it weakens it significantly at all,  he said, referring to national s negotiating position.  the fundamentals haven t altered, and that is national has significantly more seats than labour, we are larger than a labour greens combination.  if new zealand first chooses to go with labour, which are thought to have more in common in terms of policy, the gain in seats for the labour greens bloc would make it easier for peters to justify the move, analysts said. both parties have said they want to curb immigration, renegotiate certain trade deals and adjust the role of the central bank albeit in different ways.  if labour, the greens and nz first had formed a government with a majority of one (seat)...that wouldn t have sat comfortably with many people,  richard shaw, politics professor at massey university, referring to preliminary results. a labour, greens, nz first coalition would now hold a three seat majority after the final tally. but some say peters could be swayed to go to national given it would be a straightforward coalition between two parties. peters, a veteran new zealand politician who has now held the balance of power three times, has in past elections formed coalition governments with both the national party and labour. the national party won 44.4 percent of the votes, the labour party 36.9 percent, new zealand first 7.2 percent, the green party 6.3 percent.

" a quest by republicans to open alaska’s arctic national wildlife reserve was slowed after a nonpartisan senate official ruled late on wednesday that the exploration was subject to environmental assessments by the interior department. senator lisa murkowski, a republican from alaska and the head of the senate energy panel, has been pushing a measure in the u.s. tax bill that would open a portion of the refuge on the coastal plain to two lease sales in 10 years for drilling. but the nonpartisan senate official took issue with the energy committee measure as it did not fully consider requirements under a national environmental law. the official ruled that oil exploration in the refuge is not exempt to an environmental law requiring the interior department to commission an assessment, a democratic aide said. such environmental assessments can take months or years to complete.   “this is good news for us because it could slow down or prevent drilling,” the democratic aide said.   republicans offered new language to the bill after the move and said that the drilling would still advance if the tax bill passes.  “there was a little hiccup, but they fixed it in the amendment they just filed tonight, so full steam ahead,” a republican senate aide said.    murkowski said she was not concerned about procedural questions and that the issues would be fully resolved.   the arctic reserve, protected by the federal government since 1960, is home to wildlife populations including caribou, polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the seven continents. the u.s. geological survey estimates the area republicans want to drill in has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude.

" two lawmakers and six consumer advocacy groups on thursday sought to join a court case involving the u.s. consumer financial watchdog as worries that president donald trump will dismantle the agency reached a fever pitch. democratic senator sherrod brown of ohio and representative maxine waters of california petitioned a federal court to be allowed to intervene on behalf of the consumer financial protection bureau in its appeal of a decision that its structure is unconstitutional. meanwhile, six groups including u.s. public interest research group made a similar request. the ruling, that the president should be able to remove cfpb director richard cordray at will, has been stayed pending appeal. currently the director can only be fired for cause. the filings followed a request from state attorneys general to also be able to intervene in the case. currently the whole u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit is deciding whether to review the ruling in a case brought by mortgage servicer phh corp [phh.n]. it could announce it will take the appeal, which most watchers expect, as early as next week.  republicans want trump to remove cordray, saying the director has gone beyond his authority and provided cause to be fired. trump has met with former texas representative randy neugebauer, a cfpb critic, indicating trump is already seeking cordray’s replacement.  also, republican senator deb fischer, of nebraska, recently introduced legislation to put a commission in charge of the cfpb, and there is a good chance it will become law. “there’s quite a lot of reasons to be concerned,” said michael burr, faculty director at university of michigan’s center on finance. “it would be devastating to the very people who supported president trump to attack and dismantle the cfpb.”  the cfpb, created in the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law to guard individuals from fraud in mortgages, student loans and other financial products, does not need permission from the justice department to file cases in courts below the supreme court.  that means trump may also ask the justice department to file a brief in opposition in the appeal, essentially setting two agencies against each other, said mark calabria, who studies the cfpb for the conservative cato institute.

" the head of the u.s. senate judiciary committee has asked the fbi whether it warned donald trump’s presidential campaign about alleged attempts by russia to infiltrate the campaign. republican senator chuck grassley’s office said on thursday he wrote to federal bureau of investigation director christopher wray asking whether the agency provided “defensive briefings” to trump’s team given its ongoing investigation of paul manafort, trump’s campaign manager. “if the fbi did provide a defensive briefing or similar warning to the campaign, then that would raise important questions about how the trump campaign responded,” grassley wrote in the letter dated sept. 20. if the fbi did not alert the campaign, grassley said, that would raise “serious questions about what factors contributed to its decision and why it appears to have been handled differently in a very similar circumstance involving a previous campaign.” the senator said that according to press reports, u.s. intelligence had raised similar concerns with john mccain during the republican senator’s 2008 presidential campaign. grassley, however, did not ask the fbi about the possibility that it had offered trump or campaign officials such a briefing but the offer was declined.     after the 2016 election, two u.s. intelligence officers flew to new york to brief president elect trump on russia, only to find when they arrived at trump tower that the briefing had been canceled, two senior u.s. officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. manafort became trump’s campaign manager in june 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the kremlin backed former ukrainian leader, viktor yanukovich. trump denies his campaign colluded with russia and dismisses investigations into allegations of russian interference in the election as witch hunts. russia denies meddling in the u.s. election.

" the congressional budget office said on wednesday that repealing the obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than initially forecast. the cbo, the nonpartisan budget scoring agency, said that eliminating the obamacare mandate that all americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine would lower the deficit by $338 billion over the next decade, not $416 billion as it estimated in december. the agency found that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over the next decade in the individual market created by the affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. it noted that markets in most areas of the country would remain stable. president donald trump and some republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. but lawmakers, republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying. the u.s. house of representatives unveiled its tax plan last week, and the senate’s plan is expected to be released on thursday. the individual mandate is a central tenet of obamacare that health policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work. it compels young and healthy people to join health insurance markets and help lower premiums by offsetting the costs of sicker patients. americans must note on their tax returns whether they have health coverage. yet it has proved to be among the most controversial portions of the law as republicans, who say obamacare is too expensive and an example of government overreach, argue that the federal government should not be able to require people to buy health insurance if they do not want it. the cbo said in its december report that the individual mandate increases the federal deficit by encouraging people to buy subsidized coverage, either through medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, employer provided plans, or through the obamacare individual health insurance market.  eliminating the mandate would lower the deficit by reducing federal spending on subsidized health insurance coverage, it said. the cbo said abolishing the requirement would cause premiums to rise because healthier people would be less likely to purchase insurance. it found that the resulting increases would cause more people to forego insurance.

" kosovo s center right coalition led by the democratic party of kosovo signed a deal on monday with the small new alliance for kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on june 11.      finally kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said ramush haradinaj, from the center right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998 99 war against serb forces. under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120 seat parliament.  president hashim thaci is expected to give haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. a source who asked not to be named told reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the united nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  the smaller new alliance for kosovo party is led by behgjet pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest kosovar.  pacolli, who also holds a swiss passport, won many contracts from the russian government to rebuild state buildings in moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from moscow to kazakhstan.  it is unclear what post pacolli will hold in the new government.  the new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with kosovo s neighbors, especially serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the european union accession process. it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two year counter insurgency.

" incoming federal reserve chair jerome powell, chosen by u.s. president donald trump to keep the recovery humming, appears set to let an expected trillion=dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered. powell in statements throughout the year, culminating with his recent senate confirmation hearing, has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the fed to raise rates faster than expected, and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs. new data added evidence to that view on friday. employment in november grew faster than expected, but wage growth remained muted. the share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady, six year recovery that is approaching its pre crisis peak. even with the unemployment rate at a 17 year low of 4.1 percent, “there’s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market,” powell told members of the senate banking committee, saying that the fed should raise rates only gradually.  debate among powell’s colleagues, meanwhile, has highlighted other risks if the fed speeds its pace of rate increases. some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak. others have noted that if the fed continues raising short term rates while long term rates remain stalled, it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down, a typical signal of recession.  “if the fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn’t materialize, and they take rates too far, then markets would feel aggrieved,” said carl tannenbaum, chief economist at northern trust in chicago, and a former senior risk official at the fed board. other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when powell takes over in february, the tax cuts could kick in, and the fed stands aside.   with a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework, powell will lead “a more data driven fed, which at the current juncture means a more dovish fed,” until and if inflation recovers, said robin brooks, chief economist at the institute of international finance.  he expects the fed under powell to only raise rates twice next year.   policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the republican tax plan when they meet next week. they are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year. they will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond, the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear. top republicans from the house and the senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law.   though janet yellen remains fed chair until february, her final scheduled press conference on wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop powell inherits. the 64 year old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor, and help shape the statement issued that day by the federal open market committee. it is a group struggling with a fundamental issue. the economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment, a condition in which prices and wages should be rising. yet both remain weak. into that mix, the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households.  if there is still “slack” in the economy, that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase, and more workers are hired. however, if the economy is near or above its potential, as some measures indicate, it may merely cause faster than desired price increases, or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble.  as the tax plan advanced in congress, forecasting shops at goldman sachs, jp morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of fed rate increases   essentially expecting the fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome. the tax package is “ultimately worth almost two additional fed hikes” in coming years, goldman sachs economists david mericle and alec phillips wrote in a recent analysis. but the new chair’s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the fed’s go slow approach can continue, giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007 2009 crisis without creating other economic risks. “accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather, it helped restore full employment,” powell said in june in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top fed job.  his outlook is consistent with positions trump and current chair janet yellen have taken, and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the fed’s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan. at his confirmation hearing, powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation, telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain. but when asked about fed staff research that challenged a key republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs, powell kept his distance. “it’s just someone’s research,” powell told senators. “don’t associate that with a position of the board.” ",0

" japanese prime minister shinzo abe said he would dissolve parliament s lower house on thursday for a snap election, seeking a mandate to stick to his tough stance toward a volatile north korea and rebalance the social security system. abe, in power for five years, had been expected to call the election for next month to take advantage of improved support  and disarray in the opposition camp.  i ll demonstrate strong leadership and stand at the forefront to face a national crisis,  abe told reporters, mentioning japan s fast ageing population and north korea.  this is my responsibility as leader and my mission as prime minister.  natsuo yamaguchi, the head of abe s junior coalition partner the komeito party, said he understood the election would be on oct. 22.     abe said he would redirect some revenue from a planned sales tax hike in 2019 to child care and education rather than paying back public debt, although he added he would not abandon fiscal reform. rebalancing the spending would offset the potential negative effect on consumption from the tax rise, he said.  we will turn japan s social security system into one that responds to all generations by boldly diverting policy resources to resolve the two major concerns   child rearing and (elderly) nursing care   that working generations confront,  he said. abe rejected criticism that holding an election would create a political vacuum at a time of rising tension over north korea s missile and nuclear arms program. pyongyang has fired ballistic missiles over japan twice in the last month and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on sept. 3  we must not give in to north korea s threats. by gaining a mandate from the people with this election, i will forge ahead with strong diplomacy,  abe said, adding that now was the time to put more pressure on pyongyang, not open dialogue. abe, whose ratings have risen to around 50 percent from around 30 percent in july, is gambling his ruling bloc can keep its lower house majority even if it loses the two thirds  super majority  needed to achieve his long held goal of revising the post war pacifist constitution to clarify the military s role. he said his goal was for his coalition to retain a majority in the chamber. a weekend survey by the nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters planned to vote for abe s liberal democratic party (ldp) versus 8 percent for the main opposition democratic party and another 8 percent for a new party launched by popular tokyo governor yuriko koike.  the nikkei poll was more positive for abe s prospects than a kyodo news agency survey that showed his ldp garnering 27.7 percent support, with 42.2 percent undecided. abe s image as a strong leader has bolstered his ratings amid the north korea crisis and overshadowed opposition criticism of the premier for suspected cronyism scandals that eroded his support earlier this year. given the results seen in other major developed countries, however, some political analysts are not ruling out the unexpected.  abe s big gamble could yield a big surprise,  veteran independent political analyst minoru morita said. the prime minister had been expected to face a grilling over the cronyism scandals during a session of parliament from thursday and opposition party officials saw the move as a ploy to avoid difficult questions. abe on monday asked his cabinet to compile a 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) economic package by year end to focus on child care, education and encouraging corporate investment. he told public broadcaster nhk that diverting sales tax revenue would make it  impossible  to meet the government s target of balancing japan s budget   excluding debt servicing costs and bond sales   by the year beginning april 2020.   but we are absolutely not lowering the flag of fiscal consolidation,  he said. he said he believed it was necessary to revise the constitution s pacifist article 9 to clarify the military s status but said the wording of a proposed change was up to his party.  the main opposition democratic party is struggling with single digit ratings and much depends on whether it can cooperate with liberal opposition groups. on monday, just hours before abe s election announcement, tokyo governor koike said she would lead a new conservative, reform minded  party of hope  to offer voters an alternative to the ldp.   our ideal is to proceed free of special interests,  koike, a former ldp member, told a news conference. an ldp internal survey showed seats held by the ldp and its coalition partner komeito could fall to 280 from the 323 they now hold, the nikkei reported on saturday. reforms adopted last year will cut the number of lower house seats to 465 from 475.

" a majority of americans believe it should be up to president barack obama to nominate the next u.s. supreme court justice, a reuters/ipsos poll found on thursday, with opinion divided along ideological party lines. the death of conservative justice antonin scalia last week sparked an intense debate between republicans and democrats over whether obama, a democrat, should nominate scalia’s replacement before he leaves office, or whether the seat should be left open until a new president takes office in january. concerned that any appointee obama selects would tip the nine justice court in liberals’ favor, republicans in the u.s. congress and on the presidential campaign trail have said the replacement should be chosen by the next president. the white house has said obama intends to do as the u.s. constitution requires and “move promptly” to nominate a successor. the nominee must be confirmed by the u.s. senate. the poll showed that 54 percent of americans believed obama should make the nomination. the support overwhelmingly came from democrats, with 81 percent of them saying they supported obama nominating scalia’s successor. among republicans, only 27 percent said they either strongly or somewhat supported obama making the pick. democrats and republican also had different priorities when it comes to picking a supreme court nominee, according to the poll. a majority, or 67 percent, of democrats said they wanted someone pragmatic and willing to compromise, with 53 percent of republicans saying they wanted someone ideologically pure. despite its polarizing effect, the supreme court issue does not appear to be a priority issue for voters surveyed. more americans think the executive and legislative branches of government wield greater influence than the judiciary, the poll showed, and fewer than 10 percent thought nominating justices to the high court was a presidential duty most relevant to them. a third of those surveyed said they were not aware of scalia’s death, which first made headlines on saturday. the poll of 1,108 adults, including 460 democrats and 426 republicans, was conducted tuesday to thursday. it had a credibility interval of about 5 percentage points.

" myanmar s army said on wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in rakhine state. a violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 rohingya muslims to flee to bangladesh in recent months. the discover of the grave, at the village of inn din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. in a statement posted on the facebook page of the military s commander in chief, senior general min aung hlaing, the army said a five member investigation team had left the capital naypyitaw on wednesday. the team, led by lieutenant general aye win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in inn din village graveyard . it gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. general aye win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late august, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern rakhine, where many of the stateless muslim minority lived, after rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on aug. 25. rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. the united states has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . myanmar s civilian leader, aung san suu kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the rohingya. the civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter insurgency operations. it has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in rakhine if it is given evidence.

" president donald trump said on friday that churches in texas should be able to receive money from the federal emergency management agency for helping victims of hurricane harvey. trump tweeted: “churches in texas should be entitled to reimbursement from fema relief funds for helping victims of hurricane harvey (just like others)”.  trump’s tweet followed a lawsuit filed by three texas churches seeking federal aid to repair severe damage to their structures by harvey. it was not clear whether the churches had provided aid to victims. in the complaint filed on monday in federal court in houston, the texas churches said they would like to apply for aid but it would be “futile” because fema’s public assistance program “categorically” excluded their claims, violating their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion. they said fema’s ban on providing relief where at least half a building’s space is used for religious purposes, a policy also enforced after hurricane katrina in 2005 and hurricane sandy in 2012, contradicted a recent u.s. supreme court decision making it easier for religious groups to get public aid. becket, a nonprofit that advocates for religious freedoms and represents the churches, said the same principle should apply to federal fema relief for harvey victims. “the principle is that governments can’t discriminate on the basis of religious status, and that is unapologetically what fema is doing here,” daniel blomberg, a lawyer for becket, said in a phone interview. a fema spokeswoman said in an email it would be inappropriate to discuss pending litigation. the texas churches that sued are the rockport first assembly of god in rockport, which lost its roof and steeple and suffered other structural damage, and the harvest family church in cypress and hi way tabernacle in cleveland, which were flooded. the case is harvest family church et al v federal emergency management agency et al, u.s, district court, southern district of texas, no. 17 02662.

" the u.s. drug enforcement administration’s acting director criticized president donald trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be “too nice” to suspects, urging dea agents to show “respect and compassion” and saying he felt compelled to speak out when “something is wrong.” acting director chuck rosenberg sent an agency wide email on saturday, one day after trump’s speech to officers in brentwood, new york, on long island. the email was seen by reuters on tuesday. trump suggested to officers that, as part of a tougher approach to suspects, they do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. that suggestion drew criticism from many local law enforcement agencies, as well as rosenberg. “i write because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,” the acting dea chief said in the email. “the president, in remarks delivered yesterday in new york, condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.” rosenberg, who was not nominated by trump but is a holdover from the obama administration, was the first head of a federal agency to challenge trump’s remarks in a wide arena.  incidents of police brutality and law enforcement killings of black suspects have sparked mass protests nationwide and led many departments to purchase body cameras to record interactions between officers and the public.  trump, a republican, campaigned on a pro law enforcement platform, winning the support of several police unions by promising to be tough on crime and more supportive of police than his predecessor, democratic president barack obama.  chuck canterbury, national president of the fraternal order of police, the nation’s largest police union, said trump’s “off the cuff comments” are taken “too literally” by news media.  “the president knows, just as every cop out there knows, that our society does not, and should not, tolerate the mistreatment or prejudgment of any individual at any point in the criminal justice process,” canterbury said in a statement on saturday.  the dea combats drug trafficking into the united states from offices nationwide and several international posts.  rosenberg said he was not seeking to advance a political agenda, but to remind his agents of their core values, including accountability, diversity and integrity.  “this is how we conduct ourselves. this is how we treat those whom we encounter in our work: victims, witnesses, subjects and defendants. this is who we are,” he wrote.

" north carolina’s replacement on thursday of a law prohibiting transgender people from using restrooms in accordance with their gender identity could be the death knell for similar restrictions still being considered in about a dozen other states. measures similar to north carolina’s house bill 2, the so called bathroom bill, were filed in 16 states this legislative session. momentum had already slowed for most of the bills and some of them had failed. “republicans in the state that was in vanguard, north carolina, are now signaling that this legislation was not, in the end, in the best interest for their state, either for its economy or its reputation,” said mark jones, a professor of political science at rice university in houston. north carolina lawmakers said they acted to replace the law in hopes of ending boycotts by businesses and sports leagues that considered the year old measure discriminatory. the boycotts cost the southern state’s economy hundreds of millions of dollars. supporters of the restrictions have said the measures offer common sense solutions that will help keep sexual predators out of bathrooms and changing facilities. opponents say the measures are unenforceable and promote discrimination against an already marginalized group of people. none of the states that proposed similar legislation this session has enacted a version into law, according to the national conference of state legislatures, which tracks statehouses. proposals introduced in south dakota, virginia, montana and wyoming failed to pass, according to the organization and news reports.  in tennessee, a bathroom bill died in a senate committee without a debate. the state’s republican lieutenant governor questioned the need after republican president donald trump’s administration in february revoked the former obama administration’s landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice. on wednesday, arkansas state senator linda collins smith, a republican, withdrew the bathroom bill she had proposed in that state. she instead recommended the issue for study in committee after facing pressure from the state’s pro business governor and business groups to drop it. after north carolina, a similar measure proposed in texas, the most populous republican controlled state, has drawn the closest attention. it has already cleared the texas senate and moved further than the similar legislation proposed this session in the other states, the national conference of state legislatures said. a key backer of texas’ bathroom measure that restricts bathroom access for transgender people and is known as senate bill 6, was undeterred by north carolina’s change of course.   “the actions in north carolina do not affect what we have done in texas,” republican lieutenant governor dan patrick said in a statement. he previously said the law would have no economic impact on the state. but the republican speaker of the texas house of representatives said last week the bill would face a tough time in that chamber because of worries over economic fallout. alabama republican state senator phil williams said north carolina’s action would not affect similar restrictions he proposed for his state. bathroom bills will remain on the legislative landscape this year in many states, analysts said. “there are people for whom this is part of their constituency and their agenda and they campaigned on it,” said sherri greenberg, a clinical professor at the university of texas at austin lyndon b. johnson school of public affairs.

" donald trump has taken a more than 20 point lead over u.s. senator ted cruz of texas in the republican race for the presidential nomination, bolstering his position ahead of the party’s primary in south carolina on saturday, according to a national reuters/ipsos poll. among republicans, trump, a billionaire businessman, drew 40 percent support in the poll conducted from saturday to wednesday, compared with 17 percent for cruz, 11 percent for u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon ben carson, and 8 percent for former florida governor jeb bush. the results contrasted with those of a national poll conducted this week by nbc news and the wall street journal that showed trump dropping into a national dead heat with cruz in the race for the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. on the democratic side, the reuters/ipsos poll showed former secretary of state hillary clinton maintaining about a 10 point national lead over u.s. senator bernie sanders of vermont since last week’s new hampshire primary won by sanders. the republican results marked a nominal gain for trump since his win in the feb. 9 new hampshire primary, when he led cruz by 18.4 points in the national rolling survey, although the increase remained within the poll’s credibility interval. since he announced his candidacy last summer, trump has leveraged his celebrity and deep pockets to wage an unfiltered campaign that has upended the republican primary. he has led the reuters/ipsos daily tracking poll since nearly the start of his campaign, topping bush in late july. the reuters/ipsos poll also showed that either clinton or sanders would win a hypothetical general election contest with trump. clinton would likely win with 44 percent support,  compared with 37 percent for trump. sanders would likely win by 44 percent to 35 percent. the poll included responses from 476 registered republicans and 543 registered democrats. it had a credibility interval of about 5 percent.

" the trump administration is reviewing the possibility of a key change to u.s. biofuels policy requested by oil refiners and carl icahn, the billionaire investor and special advisor on regulations to president donald trump, a white house official said on monday. the administration has no position “either way on this issue at this time,” the white house official confirmed to reuters. the statements come after news last week that icahn had reached out to the white house regarding the change. the debate centers on the renewable fuel standard (rfs), a 2005 policy that requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be added to gasoline and diesel each year. oil refiners including valero energy corp and cvr energy inc currently have to show environmental regulators they are meeting those annual mandates, and have urged the government to push this compliance further downstream to fuel blenders and integrated oil companies.  opponents of the change say it will complicate ensuring compliance and that it could threaten the future of the rfs policy that sets the annual requirements for use of biofuels with gasoline and diesel. confusion over trump’s plans for rfs sparked wild swings in energy and agricultural markets last week. carl icahn, who owns a majority stake in cvr, said he had reached out to the white house about the issue. the environmental protection agency (epa) has also been reviewing requests from oil refiners including valero energy corp and delta air lines inc’s monroe energy llc. a public comment period on the issue wrapped up late last month. two sources familiar with the discussions told reuters that they have been told by administration officials they are concerned about potential political backlash from biofuels companies and fuel marketers if they make the change that icahn and valero are seeking.

" eight to 10 republican u.s. senators have serious concerns about republican healthcare legislation to roll back obamacare, moderate republican senator susan collins, who opposes the bill, said on sunday. the senate, which is delaying its consideration of the bill while arizona republican senator john mccain recuperates from surgery to remove a blood clot, will take it up as soon as all senators are available, senator john cornyn, the second ranking republican senator, said. mccain’s absence casts doubt on whether the senate would be able to pass legislation to repeal parts of the affordable care act, democratic former president barack obama’s signature legislative achievement, commonly known as obamacare. collins is one of two republican senators who have already said that they would not even vote to open debate on the latest version of the bill released on thursday, meaning one more defection from the republican ranks could kill it.. republicans control the senate by a 52 48 margin. with the democrats solidly opposed to the legislation, the republicans can only pass the bill if all their other members back it and if republican vice president mike pence casts his tie breaking vote in favor. a washington post abc news poll published on sunday showed americans preferred obamacare by a 2 1 margin. approaching six months in office, trump’s overall approval rating has dropped to 36 percent from 42 percent in april.  while collins said that she did not know if the legislation would ultimately pass, she said as many as 10 republicans have doubts about it. “there are about eight to 10 republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill,” collins told cnn’s “state of the union” program, faulting the bill for its major cuts to the medicaid government health insurance program for the poor, which she said would harm rural hospitals and nursing homes. “i don’t know whether it will pass, but i do know this, we should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that’s been on the books for 50 years   the medicaid program   without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be,” she added. republican senator rand paul also reiterated his opposition to the bill, which he described as “terrible” because it retained many of the obamacare taxes and subsidies. “the current system is terrible,” paul said on fox news sunday. “i don’t think republicans should put their name on this. it is a bad political strategy and it will not fix the problem.” the bill unwinds obamacare’s medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. but it goes beyond repealing obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to medicaid that deepen in 2025. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated the bill would cut medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut medicaid 35 percent come 2036. mccain, who plans to stay in arizona this week after a procedure to remove a 2 inch (5 cm) blood clot from above his left eye, has expressed concern about the healthcare bill but has not said how he would vote. “we need senator mccain in more ways than one. as soon as we have a full contingent of senators we will have that vote,” cornyn, of texas, told nbc’s “meet the press” program.

" with photographs obliquely showing a new rocket design, north korea has sent a message that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm) more powerful than any it has previously tested, weapons experts said on thursday. if developed, such a missile could possibly reach any place on the u.s. mainland, including washington and new york, they said. north korea s state media published photographs late on wednesday of leader kim jong un standing next to a diagram of a three stage rocket it called the hwasong 13. missile experts, who scrutinize such pictures for clues about north korea s weapons programs, said there is no indication the rocket has been fully developed. in any case, it had not been flight tested and it was impossible to calculate its potential range. however, a three stage rocket would be more powerful than the two stage hwasong 14 icbm tested twice in july, they said. south korean and u.s. officials and experts have said the hwasong 14 may have a range of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) and could possibly strike many parts of the united states, but not the east coast.  we should be looking at hwasong 13 as a 12,000 km class icbm that can strike all of the mainland united states,  said kim dong yub, a military expert at seoul s kyungnam university.  it s likely meant to show that they are working on a three stage design with greater boost and range,  said retired brigadier general moon sung muk, an arms control expert who has represented south korea in military talks with north korea. he said the pictures were intended to show that north korea was refusing to bow to international pressure to abandon its weapons programs.  the north is trying to be in control of the playing field,  moon said. wednesday s report carried by the kcna news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the united states, and u.s. president donald trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said it was unclear if the photos were taken before or after secretary of state rex tillerson on tuesday welcomed what he called the restraint north korea had shown recently in its weapons programs and said he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue  sometime in the near future.    we consider it overall a good first step that there haven t been any missile launches or testing for ...three plus weeks or so,  nauert told a regular briefing. however pyongyang needed to do a lot more to show it was willing to negotiate in good faith, she said.  the photographs were accompanied by a report of kim issuing instructions for the production of more rocket engines and warheads during a visit to the academy of defense sciences, an agency he set up to develop ballistic missiles.  we re getting a look at it to emphasize domestic production of missiles, and to advertise what s coming next,  said joshua pollack, a nuclear weapon and missile systems expert who edits the u.s. based nonproliferation review. the photographs were published as tensions between north korea and the united states appeared to have eased slightly since north korea tested the hwasong 14 and later threatened to fire missiles toward the u.s. pacific territory of guam.  kyungnam university s kim said the hwasong 13 appeared similar to the kn 08, a three stage missile of which only a mockup has previously been seen at military parades. but the new images show a modified design for the main booster stage that clusters two engines. another picture published by north korean state media showed kim jong un standing next to a rocket casing that appeared to be made of a material that could include plastic. experts said if such material were used in the missile, it would be intended to reduce weight and boost range. the photographs also showed the design for the pukguksong 3, likely a new solid fuel intermediate range ballistic missile being developed for submarine launches.

"house republicans leaders on monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the affordable care act for the first time in the nearly seven years since democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.now, they have to sell it.that challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former president barack obama.  it s obamacare in a different format,  representative jim jordan of ohio, a member of the hardline house freedom caucus, said in a phone interview. jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the house gop plan on monday evening: its extension of obamacare medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which jordan labeled  a new entitlement. earlier on monday, another member of the freedom caucus, representative justin amash of michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  obamacare 2.0.  the full freedom caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the house republican majority. if they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. a spokeswoman for its chairman, representative mark meadows of north carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on monday evening, and jordan said the group planned to meet on tuesday to discuss it.the reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the republican leadership. freedomworks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the republican individual mandate. and on tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, heritage action and the club for growth, came out against the proposal.  many americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the affordable care act (i.e., obamacare) and the american health care act,  the group s president, michael needham said.  that is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. rather than accept the flawed premises of obamacare, congressional republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  the club for growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  ryancare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- the atlanticthe introduction of the gop s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among republicans and libertarians alike. kentucky senator rand paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the gop plan  obamacare lite. according to the hill, paul is not letting obamacare lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. the libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with rep. jim jordan (r-ohio) to release their own bill to repeal obamacare on wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. we voted on this last year, and every republican voted for it,  paul said at a press conference alongside his house conservative colleagues.  that s what we should do again. you have to get rid of obamacare completely,  jordan added. paul stated in an interview earlier today that this gop bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  however paul and jordan face an uphill struggle as gop leadership, including that of president donald trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. we re going to do something that s great. and i am proud to support the replacement plan released by the house of representatives,  trump said of the bill.  it follows the guidelines i laid out in my congressional address. this will be a plan where you can choose your doctor and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. and you know what the plan is. this is the plan.    the blaze",1

" food security in the middle east and north africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region, the united nations said on thursday.  in those hardest hit by crises   syria, yemen, iraq, libya and sudan   an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the u.n. s food and agriculture organization said in its annual report on food security. a quarter of yemen s people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the iran aligned houthis and the saudi backed government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times. the report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000. it said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most gulf arab states and most north african countries including egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. but it had worsened in conflict hit countries.  the costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition,  the fao s assistant director general abdessalam ould ahmed said.  decisive steps towards peace and stability (need to be) taken.  several countries in the region erupted into conflict following uprisings in 2011 that overthrew leaders in tunisia, egypt and libya. syria s civil war, which also began with popular demonstrations, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made more than 11 million homeless.

" most european union states agreed on monday on reforming the bloc s labor rules that poorer countries value for giving them a competitive edge but french president emmanuel macron criticizes for undercutting his workers. the issue of the so called posted workers pits wealthier countries against poorer peers keen to preserve current rules that allow their citizens to work elsewhere in the bloc for salaries higher than they would get at home but still lower than the local labor force. macron has put reforming the so called posting of workers directive high on the eu s agenda and is backed by germany, belgium, luxembourg and the netherlands, among others. after some 12 hours of negotiations among labor ministers in luxembourg, most of the eu s 28 members backed a compromise that would cap posting workers abroad at 18 months and introduce a four year transition between reaching a final agreement on the reform and its taking effect. hungary, lithuania, latvia and poland said they could not back the proposal, while ireland, britain and croatia abstained over concerns that the new rules would hurt their transport industries.  europe is moving forward, i salute the ambitious agreement on posted workers: more protection, less fraud,  macron said in a post on twitter late on monday.  the dutch minister praised the deal, saying all workers deserved protection from unfair competition. his hungarian colleague said the final text was vague and left too much scope for interpretation. most eu countries were taking the floor on the matter throughout the day of negotiations on the politically sensitive reform, with one key point of contention being whether to keep international road transport covered by any new posting rules, as sought by berlin and paris among others.  spain, ireland, portugal and several states on the eu s eastern flank wanted that exempted and subject to a separate law. in the latter group, poland is the biggest exporter of cheap labor force in the eu.  the bloc s executive commission in the end declared that part of the transport sector, namely transit, would not be regulated by the posting rules.   the transport sector is a special case because of the industry s mobile nature, (and) there are several texts on the sector being discussed which will detail exactly how it will be applied,  an official at the french president s office said.      while one camp says cheap workers  easy access to their countries is weighing on salaries and undermining the labor market, the other says tightening rules amounts to protectionism and weakens competition.  it s about fairness on the labor market,  said the eu s top jobs official, marianne thyssen.  i am all in favor of freedom of movement but it must be organized in a fair way ... the internal market is based on rules, it s not a jungle.  poland, the czech republic, romania and other easterners say they should be allowed to compete with lower wages to catch up with the wealthier west after decades of communist malaise. macron embarked on a tour of eastern europe over the summer as he tries to get countries on board, and some such as bulgaria and slovakia backed the agreement.   the 18 month agreement   written down as a 12 month cap with a possible 6 month extension   bridged most differences over the maximum period allowed for sending workers abroad under posting rules before they fall under the host country s labor laws. the ministers gave a green light to opening negotiations on the reform with the european parliament, which will likely bring more changes to any final agreement.  apart from the future of transport, other themes still open include exact remuneration rules for the posting of workers, which is profitable for companies because of the wage gap in the eu.  while the estimated 2 million posted workers only make up a tiny fraction of the bloc s workforce, the issue has driven a wedge between the richer states at the center and their poorer peers on the peripheries. for macron, the reform is seen as crucial to convince his voters of a need for difficult economic reforms at home by showing he stands up for their interests in the eu.  european lawmakers last week agreed their own stance on the matter, including by proposing a 24 month limit on working abroad under posting rules, and ensuring that such mobile workers are entitled to the same bonuses as the locals.

" pennsylvania governor tom wolf, a democrat, said on wednesday that he would veto the latest republican budget as lawmakers continue their months long struggle to set a spending plan. the pennsylvania senate passed a $30 billion supplemental budget for fiscal 2016 on wednesday, and the house is also expected to approve the same bill. “in its current form, i will veto this budget, and i urge republicans in the legislature to stop the partisan games and come back to the table to negotiate a final budget that funds our schools and eliminates the nearly $2 billion deficit,” wolf said in a statement. using the republicans’ own math, he said, the budget creates a deficit that would prompt big cuts to education and social programs and lead to higher property taxes. though wolf introduced a fiscal 2017 budget on feb. 9, the state still has only a partial spending plan for this fiscal year, which began july 1. that makes a full 2016 budget nearly nine months overdue. during the impasse, school districts, colleges and social service agencies have all had to make due without state funding. the partial budget wolf agreed to in december finally sent the first six months of aid flowing to schools, but by then they had gone almost that long without any state money. school districts borrowed a collective $1 billion across the state   incurring up to $50 million in interest and fees   to stay open through december. they are now warning, again, that they could soon have to consider shutting without state funds. the spending plan passed on wednesday by the senate does not raise sales or income taxes but restores most of the $6 billion in funding wolf eliminated in his line item vetoes in december. the bill would provide $5.95 billion for basic education, a $200 million increase from the previous year. it would also restore higher education funds, including for community colleges, the pennsylvania state university and temple university. wolf took office in january 2015 pledging to restore the previous administration’s cuts to education funding. he wanted to pay for it in part with a tax on natural gas extraction, which some republican legislative leaders have opposed.

" two of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s closest allies have initiated legislation in what opponents say is a rearguard action to try to shield him from a police probe into corruption allegations against him. netanyahu is a suspect in two cases, one into alleged meddling in the media industry and the other into gifts he received from rich businessmen. he denies any wrongdoing. but, if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate. two lawmakers who want netanyahu to stay in power have proposed two new draft laws that have alarmed the attorney general and the police. one would bar police from providing prosecutors with the investigators  conclusions on whether charges should be brought against suspects. the second, known as the  french law  because of similarities with legislation in france, would delay any investigation of a prime minister until he or she leaves office. netanyahu, a right wing leader now in his fourth term, has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation, but he has not ordered his coalition head, david bitan and his co sponsor of the bills, david amsalem, to withdraw the bills. bitan said that once police publish their findings, suspects are convicted in the court of public opinion even if they are eventually cleared. those who oppose the draft bills are more worried about toppling netanyahu than about democracy, he said.  they (the bills) protect democracy. suspects have rights too,  bitan told reuters.  the  french law  has not yet been brought before parliament. coalition partners are at odds over its phrasing but bitan says he will not shelve the legislation.  the bill, he said, would not apply to the present investigations against the prime minister. but if passed, it could potentially affect any future legal moves affecting netanyahu in at least one other case in which he is currently not a suspect. [l5n1nd240] parliament passed the first draft in an initial reading this month but both drafts may ultimately fall through before being written into law. the  french law  would not apply to any investigations under way, but the other proposed law would.  in comments leaked to the media, attorney general avichai mandelblit complained about  a multitude of proposals that are meant to harm us all .  lawmakers and cabinet ministers have a right to propose bills, he said in remarks broadcast on army radio. but, in comments suggesting they were politically motivated, added that   this batch is not innocent .  i m being attacked on all fronts with means that are not within the rules of the democratic game,  mandelblit said.      police also said, in a statement to reuters, that they had come under pressure from politicians.   police will keep with its determined fight against crime and corruption, keep serving the public and will not be deterred by any attempt to weaken it,  the statement said. the two investigations in which netanyahu is a suspect are  known as case 1000 and case 2000. case 1000 revolves around gifts he received from businessmen, including cigars and champagne. netanyahu s lawyers say they were simply presents from long time friends, with no quid pro quo. case 2000 focuses on suspicions netanyahu negotiated with the publisher of israel s best selling newspaper for better coverage in return for curbs on the competition. the prime minister s lawyers say netanyahu never seriously considered any such deal.    netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him:  there will be nothing because there is nothing.   the prime minister is under no legal obligation to step down if indicted, but some political analysts predict he would opt for new elections to renew his public mandate if charged. all four prime ministers of the past two decades have been suspects in police investigations but only ehud olmert was charged and convicted. he spent 16 months in jail for accepting bribes from real estate developers.   in high profile cases such as these, police usually say if they have gathered sufficient evidence against the suspects, before handing over to the justice ministry, where the attorney general and prosecutors decide whether to file charges. mordechai kremnitzer, a law professor and vice president of the israel democracy institute, said netanyahu s governing coalition was abusing  the power of legislation  to try to extricate him from his legal problems.  this has set a record and reflects a complete loss of restraint and total shamelessness,  he said.

" u.s. organizations that have worked closely with the outgoing obama administration to improve relations with cuba on tuesday released a four page letter to president elect donald trump urging him not to act rashly toward the communist run nation. the cuban study group, an organization of cuban american business leaders who favor engagement, and the washington based engage cuba coalition, arranged what they termed the “memo” which says, “to reflexively reverse course could have pernicious consequences for u.s. economic and foreign policy interests and the prospects of evolutionary change in cuba.” the trump transition includes five cuban americans who are vocal opponents of detente and have close ties to cuban american lawmakers who are calling for a return to pre obama efforts to isolate cuba. a number of other trump appointees have expressed hostility toward the obama administration’s two year effort to normalize relations. “we are confident that a close evaluation will confirm that constructive engagement — including the reduction of travel and commercial barriers — is the best strategy for supporting the cuban people and boosting u.s. jobs and exports,” the signers of the report, which include the u.s. cuba business council, the national foreign trade council, the american society of travel agents and the association of international educators, say. they argue that the policy has improved human rights on the island, sped the expansion of internet access, led to dialogue on sensitive issues, improved national security and created jobs, among other positive results. the report follows the release last week of a similar plea by dozens of u.s. agricultural organizations which argued cuba was an important market for their products. trump, a republican, has said he will dismantle the still fragile detente unless cuba gives the united states a better deal, while providing no specifics. he is expected to review the cuba engagement on taking office on friday. trump has named jason greenblatt, a trump organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including cuba. the normalization of relations between the old cold war foes has included restoration of diplomatic relations, obama’s historic trip to cuba, the signing of 18 cooperation agreements and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the u.s. congress, now controlled by republicans. travel to the island from the united states has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and the signing of  cellphone roaming agreements, but no manufacturing or significant trade deals have been reached.

" pope francis issued a stinging new critique of the vatican s top administration on thursday, saying  traitors  stood in the way of his reforms and made any change as hard as cleaning egypt s  sphinx  with a toothbrush . for the fourth year running, francis used his annual christmas greetings to the roman catholic church s central bureaucracy, or curia, to lecture the assembled cardinals, bishops and other department heads on the need for change.  reforming rome is like cleaning the sphinx of egypt with a toothbrush,  he said, quoting a 19th century belgian churchman. the phrase did not evoke much laughter when the pope read it in the frescoed clementina hall of the vatican s apostolic palace. since his election as the first latin american pope in 2013, francis has been trying to reform the italian dominated curia to bring the church s hierarchy closer to its members, to enact financial reforms and guide it out of scandals that marked the pontificate of his predecessor, former pope benedict. but he has encountered resistance, particularly as some departments have been closed, merged or streamlined.        francis said some in the bureaucracy   the nerve center of the 1.2 billion member church and whose members are entrusted with carrying out the pope s decisions   were part of  cliques and plots . francis called this  unbalanced and degenerate  and a  cancer that leads to a self referential attitude . in his address on thursday, he spoke of those  traitors of trust  who had been entrusted with carrying out reforms but  let themselves be corrupted by ambition and vainglory.  when they are quietly let go, he said,  they erroneously declare themselves to be martyrs of the system ... instead of reciting a  mea culpa  (latin for  my fault ). francis did not cite any specific examples. last june the vatican s first auditor general resigned suddenly. he later said he was forced to step down because he had discovered irregularities but the vatican said he had been spying on his superiors. earlier this month, the vatican bank s deputy director was fired under circumstances that have not been explained. in july, in a major shake up of the vatican administration, francis replaced catholicism s top theologian, a conservative german cardinal who has been at odds with the pontiff s vision of a more inclusive church. francis said the overwhelming majority of curia members were faithful, competent and some saintly. later, in a separate meeting with lay vatican employees and their families, francis asked forgiveness for the failings of some church officials.  he spoke hours before the funeral of cardinal bernard law, the ex archbishop of boston who resigned in disgrace after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests and whose name became a byword for scandal in the catholic church.

" president donald trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, michael flynn, after his level of trust in flynn eroded to the point that he felt he needed to make a change, white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on tuesday. a day after flynn’s resignation, spicer said trump had been concerned that flynn had misled vice president mike pence over his contacts with russian officials before trump took office on jan. 20. trump had been reviewing flynn’s situation for a few weeks, he said. amid congressional calls for an investigation into the extent to which flynn discussed the possibility of lifting u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to washington, spicer said the white house legal counsel had reviewed the situation and believed flynn’s case was viewed “not as a legal issue but a trust issue.” spicer said trump was informed of flynn’s conversations with russian ambassador sergei kislyak and asked counsel to review the case. “the erosion of that trust, frankly, was the issue,” spicer said. he said trump had not told flynn to discuss u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian diplomat.

" one would expect voters from the heavily democratic brooklyn neighborhood of cobble hill to pick presidential candidate hillary clinton in the nov. 8 general election. just don’t expect them to advertise it. like lawns and windowsills in liberal pockets across the country, much of the neighborhood is bereft of pro clinton signage in the final weeks before the election. it’s a stark contrast to the 2012 and 2008 campaigns, when president barack obama whipped up a frenzy of support from democrats and his signature “hope” and “forward” signs were ubiquitous.  the scarcity of lawn and window signs is an indication of the democratic nominee’s struggle to generate enthusiasm among left leaning voters, a challenge that’s borne out in polling data, and could potentially haunt her if voters fail to turn out on election day. clinton leads republican challenger donald trump by four percentage points among likely voters, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released friday.  but americans of all political stripes have been more critical of clinton than they were of obama when he was running for his second term four years ago, according to the daily tracking poll.  among democrats, 78 percent say they have a favorable view of clinton, lower than the 89 percent favorability rating obama had at this point in the race in 2012. clinton’s favorability drops to 28 percent among independents versus obama’s 47 percent. nancy kimmel viola, a 63 year old social worker who lives about a mile away from clinton’s campaign headquarters in brooklyn, keeps a “bernie 2016” sticker taped to the front door of her carroll gardens home, a vestige of her support for the unsuccessful bid of sen. bernie sanders. while she plans to vote for clinton, she confesses that her “heart’s not in it.” “i have to vote for her.” viola said. “having trump in there is too scary.” in denver, residents in the democratic stronghold of park hill posted many yard signs over a local zoning issue, but few for the presidential race. “most of us around here will vote democratic, we always do, but we’re not overly enthusiastic for clinton,” said resident pablo marron. “but we are united in our opposition to trump.” in the heavily democratic denver suburb of northglenn, banners for local office seekers littered a major roadway, but there were no accompanying clinton signs. in the affluent liberal washington dc suburb of chevy chase, maryland, signs for the democratic nominee appeared only roughly once every 10 blocks. the lack of enthusiasm isn’t just hitting the clinton campaign. americans from both major parties say they are generally less interested in voting this year than they were in 2012, according to the reuters/ipsos opinion poll, which compared results gathered during the first 20 days of september with the same period of 2012. the clinton campaign did not respond to emailed requests for comment. clinton’s online store displayed roughly a dozen different signs and banners for sale, ranging from an 11 inch by 17 inch sign, sold at $10 for a pack of two, to a four foot by six foot “hillary for america” banner, which retailed for $100. sales data was not immediately available and a request for comment from the store went unanswered. for some, there is a “hold your nose quality” to this election, said matthew dallek, associate professor at george washington university’s graduate school of political management. “the lack of signage” in liberal enclaves may indicate, dallek said, “that there just isn’t this sort of enthusiasm that existed for obama.” but there are some blocks that buck the trend. on a street in gowanus, brooklyn, no fewer than four homes bore pro clinton signage, including a life size cutout of the democratic nominee, which rests in the windowsill of retired lawyer chris morrison’s home. the beaming cardboard clinton prompts many passersby to take pictures, said morrison, a staunch clinton supporter. “you don’t see as much signage this time around. in this neighborhood i don’t get so concerned (because everyone is) more or less on the same page,” said morrison, 66. “i worry when i go to some other places.” ",0
" a former personal assistant to an exiled chinese born billionaire, who has made claims of high level communist party corruption, has filed a lawsuit in new york accusing him of raping her, court documents show. in the civil complaint lodged with the new york supreme court on monday, the 28 year old woman said she was  lured  by the businessman, guo wengui, to new york under the guise of a one week business trip. instead, she was held  captive  and ultimately subjected to  repeated acts of mental cruelty and sexual violence , the suit says. she is seeking $140 million in compensation. guo, who lives in new york, denied the accusation, describing it as  fake . the complaint says the woman is a chinese national who was employed by one of guo s china based companies. she was told upon arrival in new york that she would work as one of the real estate tycoon s personal assistants, the complaint, reviewed by reuters, says. it said guo, also known as miles kwok,  forcibly took away  the woman s passport, threatened her, monitored her internet usage and restricted access to her phone and laptop computer. the woman said she was subjected to verbal and physical abuse, which soon escalated to sexual assault, before she managed to escape to the chinese embassy in london during a business trip with guo. after her return to china, the woman provided a statement and evidence of her allegations to police in china, the lawsuit said, without detailing the evidence. the associated press reported late last month that chinese police were investigating the woman s claims. guo refuted the accusation.  of course it s fake,  he told reuters. he said the  robbers of the country  engineered the allegations to  divert my attention, spread rumors and smear my reputation.  guo, who left china in 2014, has named senior communist party officials in a deluge of graft accusations via twitter posts and video blogs, attracting a loyal online following. he has provided little evidence for his claims. china calls guo a criminal suspect, and articles in state media have accused him of crimes including bribery, fraud and embezzlement. at china s request, interpol issued a global  red notice  for guo s repatriation in april. guo lodged an application for political asylum in the united states last week.

" papua new guinea immigration minister petrus thomas said authorities would take steps on monday to forcibly remove around 450 men who remain in an abandoned australian detention center without food or running water. hundreds of men have barricaded themselves into the manus island center for more than 13 days without regular food or water supplies, defying attempts by australia and papua new guinea to close the facility, saying they fear for their safety if removed to transit centers.   we will be taking steps with relevant authorities to move the residents based on serious exposure to health risk for the food of everyone that is remaining,  thomas said in a statement issued late on sunday. as of 5.00 p.m. (0700 gmt) monday, no moves had been made by the government to remove the men, several asylum seekers inside the center told reuters via email. one of the asylum seekers barricaded inside the center said on monday that water supplies have been destroyed after papua new guinea workers entered the site and drained rainwater collected in tanks and garbage bins.  immigration came and bored holes in the water tanks where we had been collecting rain water,  he said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from papua new guinea authorities.  they also demolished the well we built.  running water and electricity to the center were disconnected two weeks ago after australian security withdrew and the camp closed on oct. 31. the center had been declared illegal by a papua new guinea court. the united nations has warned of a  looming humanitarian crisis  among the asylum seekers, who are drawn largely from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka and syria. australia has used the center, and a camp on the tiny pacific island of nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. it says boat arrivals will never enter australia, even if found to be refugees, as that would encourage people smugglers in asia. under a refugee swap deal, the united states has agreed to accept potentially up to 1,250 asylum seekers from manus and nauru, in return for australia taking refugees from central america. the united states has so far only accepted 54 refugees. new zealand has offered to resettle 150 asylum seekers, but australia has rejected the offer.

" a macedonian court sentenced 33 ethnic albanians to jail terms on thursday, including seven given life sentences, after they were found guilty of plotting attacks and clashing with the police in a 2015 shootout in which 22 people were killed. the 33 were accused of being part of a group of albanian gunmen involved in the may 9, 2015 shootout with police in the northern macedonian town of kumanovo, in which eight police officers were among those killed and dozens were wounded. some of the defendants were from neighboring kosovo, while others were from macedonia s own albanian minority.  the evidence offered by the prosecutor shows that the accused committed the criminal acts of terrorism and terrorist organization,  the presiding judge said.  the court was under heavy police protection, with helicopters flying overhead. the defendants protested while the verdict was being read, prompting the judge to order 33 of them to leave the courtroom before hearing sentences.  the 2015 shootout occurred during a police raid that followed an attack by armed men on a border post. some of them were former guerrillas from the national liberation army (nla), an ethnic albanian militia that had fought an insurgency in 2001 in which scores of people were killed.  the nla disbanded in 2002 and some of its former leaders entered the government. naser raufi, one of the defense lawyers, said the trial was staged and that he did not expect to see such lengthy sentences.   this calls for an independent investigation,  he said.  macedonia, a small ex yugoslav republic of about two million people, declared independence in 1991 and mostly avoided the violence that accompanied the break up of yugoslavia in the 1990s, until the clashes with ethnic albanian fighters in 2001. albanians are believed to make up around 30 percent of macedonia s population, living mostly in the northwest near the borders with kosovo and albania.

" three competing plans for battling a potential zika virus outbreak in the united states were presented on the floor of the u.s. senate on thursday, as lawmakers tried to break an impasse pitting president barack obama against congressional republicans. the first test votes on the measures, which would provide at least $1.1 billion in new funds to deal with the spreading virus, were expected on tuesday. in february, obama urged congress to quickly approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with prevention and treatment of zika virus, which the world health organization warns is spreading rapidly in the americas. the disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities. it also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, guillain barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis. white house spokesman josh earnest welcomed “any sort of forward momentum in congress” while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion. “it could not be clearer that congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the zika virus. that is critical for health and safety of the american people,” earnest said. florida’s senators, bill nelson, a democrat, and marco rubio, a republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate. they noted that the florida department of health has reported a total of 112 zika virus cases, the most of any u.s. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.   one proposal now before the senate would provide obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. a second one would scale back obama’s request to $1.1 billion. these two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the zika costs, senate aides said. a third one would take money from obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in zika response funds. even if the senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the house of representatives, where republicans are deeply divided over new zika funding, according to aides. two senior republican aides said the party’s house leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over donald trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over puerto rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the house. while plans to unveil a new puerto rico bill on wednesday were canceled, a third senior house republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that “discussions” on a budget “are moving forward as well.”    senate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the senate started debating on thursday.

" president barack obama praised hillary clinton’s political experience, a boost to her campaign as she battles an insurgent bernie sanders a week before the democratic presidential nominating process kicks off. obama’s kind words for his former secretary of state, in a  politico interview published on monday, will help clinton as she tries to link her campaign more closely with the president and so draw in more support from his backers. while never explicitly criticizing sanders, a senator from vermont whose campaign is focused on pledges to redress social inequality and contain wall street excesses, obama praised clinton’s experience and suggested several times that clinton’s messages are grounded in realism. “(s)he’s extraordinarily experienced — and, you know, wicked smart and knows every policy inside and out — (and) sometimes (that) could make her more cautious, and her campaign more prose than poetry,” obama said. the interview was conducted on friday and published a week before the feb. 1 voting in iowa, which launches the process to pick the parties’ nominees for the november presidential election. clinton, who lost the democratic primary to obama in 2008, was for months the clear front runner to be the party’s nominee this time around, but opinion polls have showed a surge of support for sanders in recent weeks. she argues that while sanders’ goals on issues such as social inequality are laudable, some are unobtainable and he lacks the experience to tackle a wide range of issues. “when you’re in the white house you cannot pick the issues you want to work on, you’ve got to be ready to take on every issue that comes your way, including those you cannot predict,” clinton told the jewish federation of greater des moines on monday.  in an echo of that point that will be gratifying to the clinton campaign, obama said in the politico interview, “(the) one thing everybody understands is that this job right here, you don’t have the luxury of just focusing on one thing.” “i think that what hillary presents is a recognition that translating values into governance and delivering the goods is ultimately the job of politics, making a real life difference to people in their day to day lives,” he said. obama, who remains very popular within the democratic party, has said he will not endorse a candidate in the primary but has admitted he is watching closely to see who will succeed him. all three democrats in the race   clinton, sanders and former maryland governor martin o’malley   were set for a prime time opportunity to make their closing arguments on monday night in a nationally televised town hall meeting on cnn due to begin at 9 p.m. est (0200 gmt). the candidates were set to appear individually on stage, fielding questions from the moderators and trying to make their final pitches ahead of the iowa voting. in the interview, obama took issue with comparisons being made by pundits between himself and sanders. the vermont senator is often described as an underdog candidate who excites young voters and draws larger crowds   as obama did in his come from behind primary win in 2008. “i don’t think that’s true,” obama said when asked whether sanders reminded him of himself. however, obama did note that sanders had the “luxury of being a complete long shot and just letting loose,” while “hillary came in with the both privilege — and burden — of being perceived as the front runner.” sanders’ campaign manager, jeff weaver, agreed they are not the same, but still pointed to a similar crowd response and said sanders enjoys a similar momentum. “they’re obviously very different people,” weaver told cnn. on the republican side of the nomination fight, the battle for endorsements and voters gathered pace. senator marco rubio of florida appeared at a des moines rally with republican senator joni ernst of iowa, who told the crowd she was not endorsing a candidate but called him “someone who is very near and dear to my heart and a good friend to me.” taking questions from reporters after the event, rubio expressed confidence in a solid finish in iowa. given his current place in the polls, finishing third would likely be portrayed as a victory for rubio. “we feel very positive about it,” he said. “we feel a real good vibe here.” iowa’s other senator, chuck grassley, raised eyebrows on saturday when he appeared at a donald trump event. grassley stressed he was not providing a formal endorsement. u.s. senator ted cruz of texas picked up the endorsement of former texas governor rick perry, who dropped out of the presidential campaign last year after failing to gain traction. this was a first endorsement by a former governor for cruz, who has received no endorsements from sitting senators despite serving in the chamber. opinion polls show trump, a real estate mogul, and cruz locked in a tight battle to win the iowa voting. trump launched a video on facebook arguing that the “establishment” is trying to undermine his campaign   a direct response to recent attacks by cruz that he is part of the establishment. being dubbed part of the establishment has taken on a strong  negative connotation in the republican campaign as candidates presenting themselves as outsiders have risen in the polls. the video got more than 370,000 views in the first three hours.

" myanmar said on friday a visiting u.s. official would not be allowed to go to a region where violence has triggered an exodus of nearly 400,000 rohingya muslims that the united nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing . the rohingya have fled from western rakhine state to neighboring bangladesh to escape a military offensive that has raised questions about myanmar s transition to civilian rule under the leadership of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi. u.s. deputy assistant secretary of state patrick murphy will voice washington s concerns about the rohingya and press for greater access to the conflict area for humanitarian workers, the state department said. myanmar officials said he would meet government leaders in the capital, naypyitaw, and attend an address to the nation by suu kyi on tuesday. he would also visit sittwe, the state capital, and meet the governor of rakhine, the state government secretary, tin maung swe, told reuters, but the north of the state, where the conflict erupted on aug. 25 would be off limits.  not allowed,  tin maung swe said, when asked if murphy would be going to maungdaw district, at the heart of the strife that began when rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing a dozen people. while nearly 400,000 refugees have poured across the border into bangladesh, fears have also been growing of a humanitarian crisis on the myanmar side, but access for aid workers and reporters has been severely restricted. myanmar insisted on friday it was not barring aid workers but a government spokesman said authorities on the ground might have concerns over security. rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say the army and rakhine buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the muslim population. a reuters photographer on the bangladesh side of the border said he could see huge banks of dark smoke billowing up over myanmar territory on friday, while international aid organizations said the refugees kept coming.  there s really no sign that this flow of people is going to dry up,  chris lom of the international organisation for migration, said from the bangladeshi border district of cox s bazar.  there are still, we believe, thousands of people waiting to take boats across to cox s bazar.  u.n. secretary general antonio guterres and the u.n. security council have urged myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       myanmar rejects the accusations, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against the insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army, which claimed responsibility for the aug. 25 attacks and similar, though smaller, attacks in october. russia s u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia said on friday that while moscow was concerned  we cannot discard the fact that it was triggered by terrorist activities.   we re talking to the myanmar government, of course,  he told reporters.  we are concerned with what is happening. ... we are looking forward to an early cessation of the violence and to elevating the humanitarian situation of the population.  the government has declared arakan rohingya salvation army a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. ethnic cleansing is not recognized as a separate crime under international law but allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights violations have been heard in international courts. rights group amnesty international said evidence pointed to a  mass scale scorched earth campaign  across the north of rakhine that was unmistakably ethnic cleansing.  the evidence is irrefutable   the myanmar security forces are setting northern rakhine state ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the rohingya people out of myanmar,  said tirana hassan, the group s crisis response director. the group said it had detected 80 big fires in rohingya areas since aug. 25. while the extent of damage could not be verified, due to access restrictions by the government,  they are likely to have burned down whole villages . it said it also had credible reports of rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic rakhine and other minorities. about 30,000 non muslims have also been displaced. u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday he had spoken with suu kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas in myanmar affected by violence. the generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, suu kyi has been widely criticized abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence. the campaign against the muslim insurgents is popular at home. the u.n. refugee agency said the rohingya arriving in bangladesh were suffering  real hardship, and some of the most difficult conditions seen in any current refugee situation .  with the influx increasing daily, unhcr is appealing for an initial amount of $30 million for the emergency humanitarian response in bangladesh until the end of year,  an agency spokesman said in geneva.     bangladesh says all refugees must go home and has called for safe areas in myanmar. myanmar has ruled that out and says it will accept anyone who can verify their citizenship. most rohingya are stateless. thousands of people demonstrated after friday prayers in the bangladeshi capital, dhaka, to denounce the treatment of the rohingya.  one protest leader said they were demanding a u.n. peacekeeping force and that myanmar face charges in an international court.

" a leading u.s. promoter of latino boxing, all star boxing inc, will give free television advertising space to hispanic civic group mi familia vota, which openly criticizes donald trump’s anti immigration stance, in an effort to encourage latino americans to vote in november’s presidential election. the partnership will put the name and website of the group on signs in boxing ring corners and on t shirts worn by the athletes on spanish language network telemundo’s boxeo telemundo program, starting at the end of june, officials at both organizations told reuters. the partnership will be announced on tuesday. “desperate times call for desperate measures,” said ruben de jesus, the director of operations at florida based all star boxing, referring to this year’s presidential election. he said he decided to contact mi familia vota with the offer of free advertising after hearing “just the whole rhetoric with regards to the hispanic community” in the current election.  he did not mention any candidate by name.  “our platform is not to tell our latino citizens who to vote for, but it’s important that this year especially we engage,” he told reuters in an interview, adding the free advertising space could reach as many as 5 million people. ben monterroso, the executive director of mi familia vota, was blunter about the partnership’s aim. “i think mr. donald trump lives in another world,” he said. “in my experience working with the community, a big majority of the people that i talk to, they definitely don’t like what donald trump has done.” trump, the republican who will likely face democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 presidential election, launched his candidacy last year by calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration from mexico, a country he said was sending rapists and drug dealers into the united states.  the wealthy new york businessman has also repeatedly vowed to build a wall along the border and force the mexican government to pay for it if elected. more recently trump angered latinos by criticizing a federal judge overseeing a fraud trial against trump university, calling the indiana born man a mexican and, later, saying his mexican heritage meant he couldn’t do his job properly. trump has rejected accusations that his comments are racist and has said he is well liked by hispanics. a spokeswoman for trump was not immediately available to comment. the partnership between all star boxing and mi familia vota will begin on june 24 and run for four events this summer, then another four events after a brief hiatus, comprising 128 boxers in total, de jesus said.  half the shows will take place in florida and half in mexico. the fighters will also hold local events in florida to boost voter engagement in the critical swing state, de jesus said. that could include visits to political events around tampa and orlando, such as helping to register voters. “the boxers are coming out of their corners to fight for the community,” monterroso said. boxeo telemundo, with an over 25 year history, calls itself the most watched spanish language boxing show in the united states. the show attracts an average 550,000 viewers weekly, especially among men 18 to 49, de jesus said. mi familia vota is a non profit, non partisan group that works to register latino voters and get latinos involved in u.s. political life.

"last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. this report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.according to police spokesman stefan dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during borl nge s  peace and love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.it appears that nothing has changed since last year. yesterday, swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on friday evening.a 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the br valla festival in norrk ping on friday night.according to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  it s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, thomas agnevik, to aftonbladet.we have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.the girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.during the city festival in v ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  we have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in v stmanland, thomas gustafsson.a 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  she has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. therefore, i do not have any more details, says gustafsson.rapes at swedish festivals are not really news anymore. it is merely about announcements. we are actually there now.  speisa",1

" argentina revoked the credentials of some activists who had been accredited by the world trade organization (wto) to attend its ministerial meeting taking place in buenos aires next month, the foreign ministry and civil society groups said on thursday. the 63 activists who had their accreditations rescinded were largely affiliated with the our world is not for sale network, said organizer deborah james. the group opposes  corporate globalization  and has staged protests at previous wto meetings. a spokeswoman for argentina s foreign ministry told reuters some individuals were not allowed to attend because they were determined to be  more disruptive than constructive.   wto meetings often attract protests by anti globalization groups, but they have remained largely peaceful since riots broke out at the 1999 meeting in seattle.  we ve never had this happen before. it s totally unprecedented,  james, who is also director of international programs at the left leaning center for economic and policy research, said by telephone from washington, d.c.  the group posted a public letter including an email the wto sent to certain participants on wednesday discouraging them from traveling to argentina for the dec. 10 13 meeting to avoid being turned away at the airport. the geneva based wto did not immediately respond to request for comment after normal business hours. the financial times on thursday quoted wto spokesman keith rockwell saying the wto had asked the argentine government to reverse the decision. argentina s president mauricio macri has promoted free trade policies since taking office in december 2015, and argentina will host global events as chair of the g20 group of major economies next year. during protests that coincided with a world economic forum event in buenos aires earlier this year, security forces used water cannons and tear gas to control picketers who had blocked a highway. james said it was unusual for a government that had agreed to host an international gathering to deny entry to people who were accredited by the host organization.  the activists represented 20 different groups, including friends of the earth international and global justice now. nearly 500 civil society groups registered. james said she could not tell why some members were rejected and others not, and said she planned to attend.  they re not blacklisting me, and i m the organizer.

" the u.s. department of homeland security has temporarily halted trips by staff to interview refugees abroad as it prepares for a likely shakeup of refugee policy by president donald trump, two sources with knowledge of the decision said on thursday. the decision effectively amounts to a pause in future refugee admissions, given that the interviews are a crucial step in an often years long process. the dhs leadership’s decision to halt the interview trips was communicated to those involved in the u.s. refugee admission process on wednesday, one of the sources said.  it means that though trump has not yet ordered a temporary  halt to the refugee program, future admissions are likely to be delayed.  trump is expected to sign an executive order that would include a temporary ban on all refugees, and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on thursday that trump could sign several executive orders on friday, but that the nature of those had not been decided yet. becca heller, director of the international refugee assistance project at the new york based urban justice center, said she was informed of the decision to halt the overseas interviews by several people in and outside of government. gillian christensen, a spokeswoman for u.s. citizenship and immigration services, which is part of the department of homeland security and which conducts the interviews, said the agency had delayed “a number of upcoming trips” but that they had not been “officially canceled.” dhs officers regularly visit countries such as jordan, malaysia, el salvador, kenya and ethiopia to interview refugees seeking to enter the united states. it is usually one of the last steps in the refugee resettlement process. heller said the decision to halt the overseas interviews would cause delays in refugee processing even if trump decides to maintain the refugee program or re start it after a temporary closure. “in the past, when we’ve frozen the refugee program to re examine security issues, it’s been really important to continue processing even if you can’t admit people, because processing times in this program can be two to three years,” heller     said. during the election campaign, trump decried former president barack obama’s decision to increase the number of syrian refugees admitted to the united states over fears that those fleeing the country’s civil war would carry out attacks.  obama approved allowing up to 110,000 refugees in the 2017 fiscal year, compared with 85,000 the prior year. trump said during the election campaign that there was no proper system to vet refugees. in addition to the interviews, refugees hoping to be resettled in the united states undergo extensive security screening by multiple u.s. agencies as well as vetting by the united nations high commissioner for refugees.

" u.s. voters picked climate change advocates in a handful of gubernatorial and state legislature races on tuesday, providing a potential boost to state level efforts to fight global warming through carbon trading schemes. democratic led state and local governments have already promised to act as a counterweight to the administration of president donald trump, which is seeking to unwind climate change regulations it deems too costly, and remove the united states from a global pact to reduce emissions.  democrat phil murphy won his race on tuesday night to succeed new jersey’s outgoing republican governor chris christie. murphy ran on a platform that included a pledge to “immediately restore new jersey’s place in the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi),” a northeast carbon market from which christie withdrew in 2011. in virginia, democrat ralph northam defeated republican ed gillespe and pledged to carry out outgoing democratic governor terry mcauliffe’s executive directive to reduce carbon emissions and “allow virginia to become trading ready.” rggi chair katie dykes said its officials had been communicating with virginia as it developed greenhouse gas regulations, and welcomed the “potential dialogue with new jersey.” in washington state, a victory by democrat manka dhingra in a state senate district flipped control of the legislature to democrats, a boost to democratic governor jay inslee’s plan to join california, quebec and ontario in a carbon trading scheme.  rggi and the western state carbon market were formed more than a decade ago to help develop market based approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. the addition of virginia and new jersey to rggi would be significant. in 2016, new jersey emitted 22.1 million short tons of carbon dioxide (co2) while virginia emitted 38 million. rggi’s current nine states emitted 90 million short tons in 2016. rggi holds quarterly auctions for carbon permits, which have yielded $2.8 billion in proceeds to date, intended for use to finance clean energy and energy efficiency projects. environmental advocates said state level developments could help counter the trump administration, as its seeks to revive the u.s. coal industry and roll back environmental protections enacted by democratic former president barack obama. “we are seeing growing momentum on climate action at the state level,” said jackson morris, an official at the natural resources defense council. a white house official did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of north korea s leader at the kuala lumpur international airport are expected to plead not guilty when their trial begins at a malaysian court on monday. indonesian siti aisyah, 25, and doan thi huong, 28, from vietnam, are charged with murdering kim jong nam at the airport on feb. 13 by smearing his face with vx, a chemical the united nations describes as a weapon of mass destruction. the pair, however, have told their lawyers they did not know they were participating in a deadly attack and believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality tv show. they face the death penalty if convicted.   they (the women) will maintain their innocence,  hisyam teh, huong s lawyer, told reuters.  monday s much anticipated trial is expected to run until nov. 30 at the shah alam high court on the outskirts of the malaysian capital.          lead prosecutor muhamad iskandar ahmad declined to comment on details of the case, but said between 30 and 40 witnesses, including 10 experts, would be called to testify.  the prosecution is expected to call expert witnesses such as pathologists and chemists early on, hisyam said.     he declined to comment on the defense s strategy, but said huong was in good hands.   she (huong) has a good defense and we have the evidence to support it,  he said, without elaborating. south korean and u.s. officials have said that kim jong un s regime was behind the murder.  kim jong nam, who was living in exile in macau, had criticized his family s dynastic rule of north korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, according to some south korean lawmakers. four other people, who have not been apprehended or named, have been charged along with siti aisyah and huong. four north koreans, who police named as suspects in the case, left kuala lumpur for pyongyang on the day of the killing. an interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the four, who were caught on airport cctv cameras observing the murder, police said. naran singh, who is also on huong s defense team, has asked prosecutors to release the names of the four suspects charged with the women. gooi soon seng, siti aisyah s lawyer, did not respond to an emailed request for comment. he has previously said the presence of other suspects would change the case completely.    we believe the main suspects are the four north koreans that have left the country. if we were able to arrest them, everything would be as clear as daylight,  gooi told reporters after a pre trial hearing in july.  the once cozy ties between malaysia and north korea have been frayed after north korea questioned malaysia s handling of the investigation into kim jong nam s murder.  the malaysian government expelled the north korean ambassador. in response, pyongyang barred all malaysians from leaving the country. malaysia only secured their release in exchange for returning kim jong nam s body to north korea and safe passage home for three north korean men wanted for questioning in the case.   malaysia on thursday banned its citizens from traveling to north korea, citing security concerns from pyongyang s nuclear tests. the travel ban follows a visit earlier this month to washington by prime minister najib razak, who told u.s. president donald trump malaysia has stopped doing business with north korea, in line with u.n. sanctions.  north korea is not a member of interpol, and pyongyang was unlikely to entertain any request from malaysia to return the suspects in the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries, said ahmad martadha mohamed, an associate professor at universiti utara malaysia.    indirectly, this will make it very difficult for malaysia to put any pressure on north korea to send the suspects back,  he said.

" the top u.s. law enforcement official, under questioning from republicans at a congressional hearing on tuesday, shed no new light on the justice department’s decision not to prosecute hillary clinton over her handling of sensitive emails. attorney general loretta lynch deflected questions about the department’s inquiry into clinton’s use of a private email system while she was secretary of state, an issue that has hounded her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination. republicans grilled lynch at the house of representatives committee hearing over justice’s decision not to charge clinton, the presumptive democratic nominee for the nov. 8 election. “lynch has no intention of answering ... even the most basic questions about the legal elements the government is obligated to prove in a criminal prosecution,” said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, a republican. democratic lawmakers at the hearing largely avoided the subject, asking lynch about gun control and policing reforms.  lynch referred questions about the department’s decision to an fbi led investigative team that recommended not bringing charges. she said she was “extremely proud” of the team’s work, testifying one week after the fbi closed its year long probe. the emails case is a favorite target for presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, as well as other republican politicians. goodlatte and republican representative jason chaffetz asked the justice department on monday to investigate whether clinton committed perjury in testimony to congress about the emails. other investigations continue. at least one federal judge is seeking to establish whether clinton set up the email system to thwart laws governing the public’s access to official records. judge emmet sullivan of the district court in washington, who is overseeing a lawsuit accusing the state department of not complying with records requests by the conservative watchdog group judicial watch, is considering whether to order that clinton give testimony about the system under oath.  clinton’s lawyers argued against her having to testify in court papers filed on tuesday, saying she had no more information to provide that was not already in the public record and that the justice department still had her emails and computer equipment. judge sullivan is due to rule on whether to order the deposition after a hearing next monday. fbi director james comey told a congressional hearing last week he recommended against charging clinton because there was insufficient evidence that she acted with bad intent. he added that any of his employees who handled emails the way clinton did could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.

" a healthcare bill being unveiled by u.s. senate republicans on thursday is expected to roll back the obamacare expansion of the medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low income people buying private insurance. those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients’ income, a “major improvement” from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the house of representatives that tied them solely to age, republican senator susan collins said on wednesday. the washington post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for planned parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  the healthcare bill will be released to the republican senate conference on thursday morning and posted online, senators said. a vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. senate republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of obamacare, former democratic president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of medicaid. “there is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the obama healthcare law,” senator john barrasso, a member of the senate republican leadership, told cnn. “people across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.” democrats accuse republicans of sabotaging obamacare, and say the republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. democratic senator patty murray of washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was “every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the house.” president donald trump and fellow republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          some republican senators voiced concern on wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party’s leaders prepare to unveil it. republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. “i’d find it hard to believe we’ll have enough time,” he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, “i won’t be voting yes.” democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the republican led senate need at least two republicans to defect. the democrats have criticized the behind the scenes meetings, and blocked senate committees on wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, defending the closed door sessions, has said all senate republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that democrats are not interested in overhauling obamacare. once the plan is unveiled, senate republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the house version would be harmful for low income americans and people with pre existing health conditions, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday.  trump told a rally in iowa on wednesday night that he hoped the senate would come up with a “really good” bill. “i’ve been talking about a plan with heart,” trump said. he had privately called the house legislation “mean,” according to congressional sources. several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the medicaid expansion that took place under obamacare. moderates favored a seven year phase out, but the senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. there was also an argument over medicaid’s growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. “that’s what we’re told it might be,” said republican senator bill cassidy of louisiana.  cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost sharing subsidies made available to help low income americans under obamacare “for a couple of years.” collins, a moderate republican from maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan congressional budget office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  “the first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,” she said.  an estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the republican controlled house, according to the cbo.

" criminal justice reform advocates said they expect donald trump will embrace moderate change once he is in the white house, toning down the punitive but undefined “law and order” image he projected on the campaign trail. in another instance of experts trying to pin down trump on an issue he used on the stump without offering much detail, two groups that have met recently with his staff said they expect him to back mainstream sentencing and corrections reforms. a trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. in a meeting a few weeks ago, trump’s staff was “very receptive” to arguments that crime rates have dropped in states that have reduced prison populations through sentencing reform, said holly harris, executive director of the u.s. justice action network, a bipartisan coalition that spearheads legislative efforts to lower sentences for nonviolent offenders. democratic president barack obama, many republicans in congress and several of trump’s conservative mentors have embraced changing sentencing standards and better prisons. during the campaign, trump denounced obama as being too soft on inner city violence and for extremist plots against the united states and attacks on police officers. for instance, in the oct. 19 presidential debate with democratic opponent hillary clinton, trump said: “we need law and order, but we need justice, too. our inner cities are a disaster. you get shot walking to the store. they have no education. they have no jobs.” but in the same month, trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, said he was proud that indiana approved criminal justice reform during his tenure as governor.  “we have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect an institutional bias in criminal justice,” he said. tim head, executive director of the conservative christian faith and freedom coalition, said his group has held advisory talks with the president elect’s staff in recent days. head said trump’s justice department is likely to emphasize greater “support for law enforcement, maybe deference for law enforcement” than obama did. but head and harris also both noted that republicans close to trump, such as former house speaker newt gingrich and new jersey governor chris christie have advocated for reforms such as lowering sentences for some nonviolent crimes, improving prison conditions and helping former prisoners find jobs and housing. christie and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani are reportedly on a short list of conservatives whom trump is considering for u.s. attorney general. inimai chettiar, director of justice programs at the brennan center for justice of new york university, said trump made some  “troubling” campaign trail claims. one, she said, was arguing that rising crime justifies stop and frisk tactics and other police methods that critics say unfairly target minorities. however, she said, she also hoped the president elect would fall in line with members of the republican party who support bipartisan criminal justice reform.

" ramin forouzandeh had applied to 13 phd economics programs in the united states, but after president donald trump signed his first travel ban in january, the 25 year old iranian turned to canada for other options.  he said he had focused on u.s. schools because they hosted most of the world’s top 20 economics programs. “before the travel ban, i never really considered other alternatives.”  by late march, u.s. courts had halted two versions of trump’s travel ban, yet forouzandeh signed for university of toronto’s rotman school of management and turned down the university of minnesota’s prestigious phd program. his countryman, mahdi ebrahimi kahou, 30, was well into his first year of the minnesota program when he decided to transfer to the university of british columbia because of trump’s executive orders that banned travel from seven and later six muslim majority countries, including iran. “i lost my motivation to work completely,” he said.  a reuters survey of 19 canadian universities showed a spike in international applications, most notably from iran and india. five top canadian economics and business phd programs are getting at least half of their new iranian students this fall because of the ban, based on interviews with universities and students. most of those, like forouzandeh and ebrahimi kahou, are opting out of u.s. programs in a field where the united states both dominates and relies on foreign talent. while those programs represent only one field and a fraction of the u.s. student population, they offer early evidence of the direct impact of trump administration policies. academics fear they may also be a sign of things to come if the chilling effect of trump’s “america first” agenda spreads beyond any specific field of study or nationality. “this strikes at the heart of what has made u.s. higher education the envy of the world,” said mary sue coleman, chair of the association of american universities.    “it’s this notion that the u.s. is no longer a welcoming place for the best and the brightest.”   iranians are by far the biggest group among students directly affected by the bans and form a small but notable part of the talent pool in areas such as engineering and economics, where u.s. academic institutions excel. iranians ranked sixth last year among international students enrolled in u.s. graduate programs, according to the institute of international education.  a survey conducted jointly by five u.s. higher education associations in february showed 38 percent of u.s. colleges reporting a drop in foreign applications, with those from the middle east down the most, while 27 percent saw no change   a significant cool down after nearly a decade of steady growth. in 2015, at least 35 percent of graduate students at u.s. universities granting graduate degrees in science, engineering and health were foreigners, according to the national science foundation.  (for a graphic on u.s. universities, global brains, click tmsnrt.rs/2qlario ) this year, about 60 percent of graduating phds from the top 10 u.s. economics departments come from other countries, a reuters analysis shows. “you’ve got an issued order that’s been temporarily blocked that applies to six countries. but the destabilization of the whole situation for international students and faculty could not be overstated,” said rice university president david leebron. he said that for foreign students everything from getting a visa on time to employment opportunities had been thrown into question. according to rice’s dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies, this year’s phd programs will have slightly fewer chinese, indian and middle eastern students than expected. more iranian students declined offers of admission than usual, with several saying that they decided to study in another country because of concerns about getting a u.s. visa.  there is no evidence of a mass exodus of foreigners   indeed, rice will have more students than expected from europe and latin america, offsetting declines elsewhere   but academics cite dozens of examples where trump’s policies had an impact. at arizona state university, for example, iranians would typically make up a fourth of the economics phd program, but there will be none in the incoming class this fall. of those already enrolled, two are moving to canada. one student who visited his family in iran over the christmas break still has not been able to return, leaving the university scrambling to cover the classes he was supposed to teach.   “the effects of this are big,” said gustavo ventura, asu’s economics department chair. “these people, not just the ones that come to us   anyone who comes to a phd program abroad   are the cream of their student population.” the university of illinois now has 10 iranians in its phd program, and while it’s not certain why, none of the iranians whom it offered admission are among the 22 students from 11 countries entering in the fall.  at indiana university’s economics program, three iranians withdrew their applications almost immediately after the travel ban, said todd walker, director of the department’s graduate studies. “we also had many more international applicants turn us down this year relative to the last three years,” he said. “i cannot say definitively how much of this is attributable to the travel ban, but i suspect it played a role.” in british columbia, the simon fraser university has admitted 20 percent more international students for the fall term, according to associate dean jeff derksen. he said queries he had received and an online survey suggested more graduate students were considering alternatives to u.s. programs. “this indicates that the international map of academic knowledge production has changed.” the prestige of the u.s. programs remains a big draw, but those committed to a u.s. career are more aware of risks.  for example, soheil ghili, who is getting a phd in economics from northwestern university’s kellogg school of management this month and will start as a post doctoral fellow at yale this summer, is hedging his bets. “let me put it this way: i will be more careful to not miss networking opportunities with people from toronto and london.”  ",0

" actor and activist richard gere said on friday that u.s. president donald trump has managed to merge the meaning of the words “refugee” and “terrorist” in the minds of many americans. gere also told a news conference at the berlin film festival just before the world premiere of his new film “the dinner” that he found it discouraging to see term “refugee” go through such a dispiriting change of meaning in the united states.  “the most horrible thing that trump has done is conflated two words – refugee and terrorist,” gere, 67, told more than 100 journalists. “it means the same thing in the u.s. now. that’s what he’s accomplished to a large segment of our population.” trump ordered a travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven muslim majority countries on jan. 27. a u.s. appeal court in san francisco refused to reinstate a temporary ban on the order. trump criticized the court decision. “a ‘refugee’ used to be someone that we had empathy for ...someone we wanted to help who we wanted to give refuge to,” gere said.  “...now we’re afraid of them and this ...is the biggest crime in itself: conflating these two ideas.” gere met chancellor angela merkel this week while in berlin for the festival. she told trump in a phone call two weeks ago the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for banning people from muslim majority countries. in the film “the dinner”, gere plays a famous politician who meets his wife and his brother at a hip restaurant to discuss a horrible crime committed by their sons.  in an interview with reuters before the news conference, gere said he was encouraged by protests in the united states against trump’s policies. “i am essentially an optimist so i am seeing this as an opportunity for people to show up the day after he was inaugurated,” gere said. “there were millions of people in the streets in new york. it wasn’t angry demonstrations. it was positive demonstrations that were kind of a unity of purpose.” more than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict and persecution, have arrived in germany over the last two years.  “the dinner” is one of 18 films at the ‘berlinale’, competing for golden and silver bears. the festival runs until feb. 19.

" the republican and democratic leaders in the u.s. house of representatives on thursday expressed optimism over prospects for a bill helping puerto rico out of its debt crisis, but they indicated that a legislative fix could still be weeks away at least. democratic and republican lawmakers are working in “good faith” to finalize legislation addressing puerto rico’s debt crisis by may 1, nancy pelosi, the house democratic leader said. house speaker paul ryan, a republican, said, “i think we are going to get there.” pelosi said at her weekly news conference that democrats still have some concerns about the bill and are working with republicans to address them. republicans who control congress outlined a plan this week to help puerto rico write off billions of dollars in debt if an agreement with creditors is out of reach. that plan would create a forum for investors to negotiate with puerto rico officials while the island’s government tries to curb deficit spending that has created $70 billion in debt.  ryan told reporters at a separate press conference on thursday that there were not enough democratic votes in the house natural resources committee to help get the measure approved. but house republican aides acknowledge that they also have work to do on their side of the aisle, especially in convincing some of their more conservative members that a puerto rico aid bill is needed. underscoring that, ryan is calling together his 246 republican members for a closed meeting on friday to review the legislation that is taking shape and to urge support. one aide characterized the message friday as being aimed at helping republicans understand that if they do not support a puerto rico bill now, much more costly bailout measures likely would be necessary down the road. ryan said his priority on puerto rico is twofold: “to protect the american taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall puerto rico if the status quo continues going in the direction its going.” pelosi said democrats’ main concern with the republicans’ first draft of the legislation was the part of the bill on restructuring. negotiators were moving forward on the makeup of a proposed oversight board, pelosi said, but a “new wrinkle” has emerged over the role of creditors in the u.s. commonwealth’s debt restructuring decisions. ryan said an oversight board would be the best possible way to prevent taxpayers from bailing out puerto rico.

" british police arrested three men in south wales over last week s bombing of a busy commuter train in west london, meaning five people are now being questioned by detectives over the attack which injured 30 people.  a 25 year old man was arrested on tuesday evening in newport, while two others, aged 48 and 30, were detained at another address in the welsh town in the early hours of wednesday, london police said.  this continues to be a fast moving investigation. a significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on friday,  said commander dean haydon, head of london police s counter terrorism command.  we now have five men in custody and searches are continuing at four addresses. detectives are carrying out extensive inquiries to determine the full facts behind the attack.  the home made bomb went off on friday during the morning rush hour on a packed train at parsons green underground station, engulfing the carriage in flames, although it appeared that the device did not fully explode.     in the aftermath, the authorities raised britain s threat level to its highest rank of critical, meaning an attack was considered imminent, but lowered this after arresting two men on saturday.   an 18 year old was arrested in the departure lounge at the port of dover on saturday and another suspect, 21, was detained hours later in the west london suburb of hounslow. both were said by local media to have links to a property in sunbury on thames, a town just outside london, where police were carrying out a major search.  the house belongs to a couple who have fostered hundreds of children, including refugees. the leader of the local authority was quoted as saying the 18 year old was an iraqi who had come to britain as an orphan.  islamic state militants said they were responsible for the attack although both british and u.s. officials have cast doubt on the claim, saying there was no evidence any recognized militant group had ordered or organized the bombing. friday s bombing was the fifth major attack regarded by authorities as a terrorist incident in britain this year which have claimed the lives of 36 people.

" both sides would benefit if israel recognized it cannot permanently occupy palestinian land and if palestinians rejected incitement and recognized israel’s legitimacy, u.s. president barack obama told the united nations on tuesday. obama’s efforts to bring about an israeli palestinian peace agreement have failed over the nearly eight years he has been in the white house, with the latest push by u.s. secretary of state john kerry collapsing in 2014. u.s. officials have held out the possibility obama could lay out the rough outlines of a deal   “parameters” in diplomatic parlance   after the nov. 8 presidential election and before he leaves office in january, but many analysts doubt this would have much effect. “surely israelis and palestinians will be better off if palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel ...(and if) israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land,” obama said. speaking at the general assembly annual gathering of world leaders at the united nations for the last time as president, obama also said russia was trying to recover “lost glory” through force.  he warned russia that if it “continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure.” russia annexed ukraine’s crimean peninsula in 2014 after months of protests in kiev ousted pro moscow ukrainian president viktor yanukovich. on the international dispute over the south china sea, obama said: “a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability then the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.”  china claims almost all of the south china sea, through which ships carrying about $5 trillion in trade pass every year. brunei, malaysia, the philippines, taiwan and vietnam also have claims in the sea, which is also believed to be rich in energy resources and fish stocks. in july, an arbitration court in the hague said china’s claims to the waterway were invalid, in a case was brought by the philippines. beijing has refused to recognize the ruling.

" seven democratic senators urged the u.s. justice department on wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies, saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower quality healthcare for consumers. the department is reviewing aetna inc’s $33 billion plan to buy humana inc and anthem inc’s $48 billion proposal to buy cigna corp. if approved, the deals, both of which were announced last july, would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three. “we urge the doj (justice department) to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers,” wrote senators richard blumenthal of connecticut, al franken of minnesota, elizabeth warren and edward markey of massachusetts, sherrod brown of ohio, dianne feinstein of california and mazie hirono of hawaii. the letter was dated wednesday and addressed to renata hesse, who heads the justice department’s antitrust division. in the letter, the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients.  “the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers,” they wrote. the lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues, and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets, but then did not use them. “we are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today, given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past,” the lawmakers wrote. capitol hill does not have a say in whether the justice department sues to stop deals. aetna spokesman t.j. crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with humana in the second half of this year. “we believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers. we continue to cooperate with the department of justice on its thorough review of the transaction,” crawford said. representatives of anthem could not immediately be reached for comment.

" beijing s city authorities have taken down from their website a policy document put up just a few days ago that looked to help improve the city s notorious air quality by banning construction during winter months. it is unclear if the move means the prohibition is no longer in place, with an official at the beijing municipal commission of housing and urban rural development who gave his name as yu saying the document had been pulled from the website due to misunderstandings over the rules in media reports. he declined to give further details. the statement, dated sept. 15, was posted on the commission s website last friday, but it was no longer available on wednesday. it was not clear when it was withdrawn. under the plan, all construction of road and water projects, as well as demolition of housing, would be banned from nov. 15 to march 15 within the city s six major districts and surrounding suburbs. as part of dust control measures, the government often instructs construction sites in northern cities to close during bouts of heavy smog in the winter when households crank up heating, drawing on the power grid which is mainly fueled by coal. provincial authorities are rushing to enforce the central government s ambitious targets for preventing toxic air during the upcoming colder months as it has ramped up its years long war on smog. the possible pulling of the construction rules underscores the complexity of implementing some of the steps. among the most stringent measures are orders for heavy industry such as steel mills to curb output by as much as 50 percent during the colder months. recent checks of factories across the north have forced many to close or curb operations, roiling supplies of some critical raw materials like coke and coal and sending prices of base metals soaring.

" a historic black church in mississippi was burned and spray painted with “vote trump” and authorities said on wednesday it was arson and being probed as a hate crime committed one week before the u.s. presidential election. greenville fire chief ruben brown sr. told a news conference on wednesday afternoon that investigators had determined the fire at hopewell missionary baptist church was “intentionally set.” “samples and evidence have been collected from inside the church and are being analyzed to determine the accelerant or ignition source,” brown said. earlier in the day he said no one was injured in the tuesday evening blaze, but the church was extensively damaged.  “we’re investigating this as a hate crime,” greenville police chief delando wilson told a news conference early on wednesday. “we feel that the quote on the church is intimidating. “it tries to push your beliefs on someone else, and this is a predominantly black church and no one has a right to try to influence the way someone votes in this election.” wilson told the wall street journal that police on wednesday evening were interviewing a “person of interest” in connection with the fire but the individual had not been charged. wilson did not immediately return a call or email.  black churches in the u.s. south have long been a base of support for the democratic party.  during the u.s. civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, southern black churches were often targets for arson and bombings by white supremacists. “the fbi jackson division is aware of the situation in greenville, and we are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,” the agency said in a statement. “this act is a direct assault of people’s right to freely worship,” greenville mayor errick simmons said in a statement.  the town of some 33,000 people is about 100 miles (160 kms) northwest of jackson. “the act that happened left our hearts broken,” pastor carolyn hudson told the news conference, noting that the church has a 111 year history. the mississippi republican party declined to comment.  in october, the orange county republican party’s office in hillsborough, north carolina, was set on fire and a graffiti message left nearby said “leave town or else.” no arrests have been made in that incident, which indiana governor mike pence, the republican vice presidential candidate, called “political terrorism.”  ",0
" president elect donald trump on thursday named u.s. representative ryan zinke of montana, a former navy seal commander who questions whether humans are largely the cause of climate change, as his choice for secretary of the interior. if the senate confirms zinke, a republican, to lead the interior department, he will head an agency that employs more than 70,000 people across the country and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as yellowstone and yosemite. as a one term u.s. congressman, zinke took several stances favoring coal, which is high in carbon emissions when burned. coal output suffered during the administration of democratic president barack obama as the development of competing fuels natural gas and solar and wind power soared. zinke, 55, pushed to end a moratorium on federal coal leases on public lands by 2019, saying it had resulted in closed mines and job cuts. he also helped introduce a bill expanding tax credits for coal burning power plants that bury carbon dioxide emissions underground to fight climate change, a measure supported by coal interests and some moderate environmental groups. in introducing the bill, zinke said he wanted to keep “coal, oil and gas communities viable for generations to come.”  the interior department includes the national park service, the bureau of indian affairs, the bureau of land management, the bureau of ocean energy management, which has oversight over offshore oil drilling and wind power; and the fish and wildlife service.  trump’s potential cabinet is filling with nominees from top fossil fuel producing states. he tapped oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, an ardent opponent of obama’s measures to curb climate change, to run the environmental protection agency and rick perry, a climate skeptic and former governor of texas, to head the department of energy.  zinke would replace sally jewell, who in january put a temporary ban on coal mining on public lands, canceled leases for drilling in the arctic and atlantic coasts, expanded wildlife protections and cracked down on methane emissions from the energy industry on tribal and public lands. the choice of zinke surprised some observers because republican officials had wanted him to challenge democratic senator jon tester in montana’s 2018 senate race. many environmental groups oppose zinke for his commitment to fossil fuels and his view that the science on climate change is “unsettled.” bradley campbell, the president of the conservation law foundation feared that zinke would be given the task of unraveling obama’s protections of the environment and federal lands. considering zinke’s history on climate and his defending fossil fuel interests, “it is likely that we will be facing an uphill battle,” campbell said. zinke, a regular hunter and fisherman, impressed trump’s son, donald jr., who shares those interests. land tawney, the president and chief executive officer of the outdoors group backcountry hunters & anglers, said zinke would bring a conservationist voice to trump’s leadership team. zinke is a proponent of keeping public lands under federal ownership, which puts him at odds with some in his party who would like to privatize the lands or put them under control of the states.  “he’s been great at keeping public lands in public hands and goes against the republican establishment,” tawney said.

" french voters view far leftist jean luc melenchon as the strongest opponent of president emmanuel macron, according to a new poll on tuesday that highlights the weakness of mainstream opposition. the ifop fiducial poll showed macron s popularity has dropped sharply since he took power in may but its key finding could help him as he embarks on reforms because polls show voters see melenchon as too extreme to be a serious candidate for power.  melenchon is very much on the protest front but not seen as an actual alternative (to macron),  said frederic dab of ifop pollsters.   that can be an opportunity for emmanuel macron, allowing him to create a vacuum around him and replace the left right divide by a reform vs protest debate.  the poll for paris match and sud radio showed 45 percent of voters say melenchon s  france unbowed  party provides the strongest opposition to macron. that is more than twice the figure for the conservative republicans (lr) or the far right national front (fn). only 8 percent mentioned the socialists. france unbowed has been much more vocal than the conservatives or socialists. the republicans have been subdued in the wake of their defeat in the presidential election and divided over what stance to take toward macron, whose economic policies resemble what many in their party have asked for for years. all three parties are struggling to get their voices heard above macron and melenchon s criticism of each other.  macron is trying to eliminate anything there is between him and extreme parties. i won t let him do that ... i won t resign myself to melenchon being the only opposition to macron,  laurent wauquiez, the frontrunner to win lr s leadership in december, said on sunday.  a government source said melenchon s relative strength was welcome and he was macron s only proper opponent.   i was praying to have jean luc melenchon and marine le pen in parliament ... the emmanuel macron/edouard philippe alliance was meant to get the socialist party and the right to explode and we are not disappointed,  the source said. he was referring to the fact that macron s prime minister philippe comes from lr.     melenchon strongly opposes macron s plans to overhaul labor laws but his party can do little to block the measures because it has just 17 lawmakers in the 577 strong parliament. melenchon, an anti nato euroskeptic known for his fiery debating style, has called on his supporters to march on sept. 23 to protest the labor reforms, which will give companies more flexibility on firings, pay and working hours. the poll confirmed macron s drop in popularity with 46 percent saying they approved of his policies, down 10 points from july.

" new zealanders will likely need to wait several more days to find out who will form the new government in the south pacific island nation, the small nationalist party holding the balance of power said on thursday. the new zealand first party was holding a fifth day of talks with both the ruling national and the opposition labour party to form a coalition government, almost three weeks after an inconclusive general election.  prime minister bill english s ruling national party won 56 seats in the sept. 23 election, while a labour green bloc have 54 seats, leaving both needing new zealand first s nine seats to meet the 61 seats needed for a majority in parliament. new zealand first leader winston peters said that he was  pretty confident  that those talks with the main parties would conclude on thursday evening, but said the nz first board would not meet to discuss its options until the weekend at the earliest.  it depends upon the logistical availability of the board which will be saturday, sunday or monday,  peters told reporters.  i ll know that before too long.  asked whether the public would know who the government is by the end of next week, peters said yes,the stuff.co.nz media website reported.  the political limbo has pushed the new zealand dollar, the world s 11th most traded currency, down by around 3.3 percent since the vote. the kiwi was trading at $0.7103 mid afternoon on thursday after hitting a four month low earlier this week. two recent independent surveys have suggested the uncertainty is curbing business sentiment, although official data released on thursday indicated that consumer confidence remained robust. there are also concerns that a government including the nationalist nz first would lead to more interventionist economic policies. peters fueled those fears earlier this week when he said that exporters should welcome the recent fall in the local currency. nz first also wants to restrict foreign investment, curb immigration and renegotiate certain trade deals.  strong immigration has been blamed for the country s hot housing market and unaffordable prices. data from the real estate institute of new zealand released on thursday showed that the number of properties sold in september was the lowest for that month for six years, as the market awaited an election result. peters lost his own seat in the election to a national candidate but remains the lead negotiator and eligible for a ministerial post as leader of nz first.  he said talks so far had focused on policy, with no discussions yet on ministerial portfolios or offices.  peters said he was aiming for a  serious consensus  from the nz first board on which party to support, but he declined to identify or number those board members.

" pope francis held talks on monday with myanmar s military chief at the start of a delicate visit to a majority buddhist country that the united states has accused of  ethnic cleansing  against its muslim rohingya people. the leader of the roman catholic church will also visit bangladesh, where more than 620,000 rohingya have fled to escape what amnesty international has called  crimes against humanity . myanmar s army has denied accusations of murder, rape, torture and forced displacement that have been made against it. the pope s first meeting in yangon was with military commander senior general min aung hlaing in st. mary s cathedral in the heart of the southeast asian nation s largest city.  they discussed the great responsibility of authorities of the country in this time of transition,  vatican spokesman greg burke said after the 15 minutes of talks, which were followed by an exchange of gifts. francis presented the general with a commemorative medal of his visit, and min aung hlaing gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat and an ornate rice bowl, burke said. the army chief told the pope that  there s no religious discrimination in myanmar and there s the freedom of religion,  according to a statement on the facebook page of min aung hlaing.  every soldier s goal is to build a stable and peaceful country,  the army chief was paraphrased as saying in the statement.  members of ethnic minority groups in traditional dress welcomed francis at yangon airport, and children presented him with flowers as he stepped off his plane. he waved through an open window at dozens of children waving vatican and myanmar flags and wearing t shirts with the motto of the trip    love and peace    as he set off in a car. only about 700,000 of myanmar s 51 million people are roman catholic. thousands of them traveled by train and bus to yangon, and they joined crowds at several roadside points along the way from the airport to catch a glimpse of the pope. more than 150,000 people have registered for a mass that francis will say in yangon on wednesday, according to catholic myanmar church spokesman mariano soe naing.   we come here to see the holy father. it happens once in hundreds of years,  said win min set, a community leader who brought a group of 1,800 catholics from the south and west of the country.   he is very knowledgeable when it comes to political affairs. he will handle the issue smartly,  he said, referring to the sensitivity of the pope s discussions about the rohingya. large numbers of riot police were mobilized in yangon but there were no signs of any protests. the trip is so delicate that some papal advisers have warned francis against even saying the word  rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority christians. the rohingya exodus from rakhine state to bangladesh s southern tip began at the end of august, when rohingya militants attacked security posts and the myanmar army launched a counter offensive. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson last week called the military operation  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions for  horrendous atrocities . myanmar s government has denied most of the accusations made against it, and the army says its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. myanmar does not recognize the rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity, and it even rejects the term  rohingya  and its use. many people in myanmar instead refer to members of the muslim minority in rakhine state as illegal migrants from bangladesh.  francis is expected to meet a group of rohingya refugees in dhaka, capital of bangladesh, on the second leg of his trip. the most tense moments of his myanmar visit were expected to be the private meeting with the army chief and, separately, with civilian leader aung san suu kyi on tuesday. vatican sources say some in the holy see believe the trip was decided too hastily after full diplomatic ties were established in may during a visit by suu kyi. suu kyi s reputation as a nobel peace prize laureate has been tarnished because she has expressed doubts about the reports of rights abuses against the rohingya and failed to condemn the military. the pope has already used the word rohingya in two appeals from the vatican this year.  asked if he would say it in myanmar, burke said francis was taking the advice he had been given seriously, but added:  we will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word . a hardline group of buddhist monks, previously known as ma ba tha, said it welcomed the pope s visit but warned, without elaborating, of  a response  if he spoke openly about the rohingya.  i hope he doesn t touch on sensitive issues that myanmar people couldn t accept,  said tawparka, a spokesman for the group, who goes by a single name.  there s no problem if he talks about islam, but it s unacceptable if he speaks about rohingya and extreme terrorists.

" civilians caught up in the battle for the syrian city of raqqa are paying an  unacceptable price  and attacking forces may be contravening international law with their intense air strikes, the top united nations human rights official said on thursday. a u.s. led coalition is seeking to oust islamic state from raqqa, while syrian government forces, backed by the russian air force and iran backed militias are also advancing on the city. some 20,000 civilians are trapped in raqqa where the jihadist fighters are holding some of them as human shields, the world body says. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said that his office had documented 151 civilian deaths in six incidents alone in august, due to air strikes and ground based attacks.  given the extremely high number of reports of civilian casualties this month and the intensity of the air strikes on raqqa, coupled with isil s use of civilians as human shields, i am deeply concerned that civilians   who should be protected at all times   are paying an unacceptable price and that forces involved in battling isil are losing sight of the ultimate goal of this battle,  zeid said in a statement.   ...the attacking forces may be failing to abide by the international humanitarian law principles of precautions, distinction, and proportionality,  he said.  the u.s. led coalition has said it conducted nearly 1,100 air strikes on and near raqqa this month, up from 645 in july, the u.n. statement said. russia s air force has reported carrying out 2,518 air strikes across syria in the first three weeks of august, it added.  meanwhile isil fighters continue to prevent civilians from fleeing the area, although some manage to leave after paying large amounts of money to smugglers,  zeid said. we have reports of smugglers also being publicly executed by isil.  u.s. led warplanes on wednesday blocked a convoy of islamic state fighters and their families from reaching territory the group holds in eastern syria and struck some of their comrades traveling to meet them, a coalition spokesman said.

" u.s. lawmakers in the house armed services committee began debating an annual defense policy bill on wednesday that would shift $18 billion in pentagon war funding to other military needs. the proposed legislation would use the $18 billion to halt cuts to the size of the military and boost training and maintenance in an effort to improve u.s. military readiness. the funding shift would leave $35.7 billion to pay for u.s. military efforts in afghanistan, iraq and syria. the house panel said that was enough to last through april 2017, giving the next president time to evaluate the security situation and make a supplemental budget request to congress. representative madeleine bordallo, a democrat from guam, said she was “concerned that the short sighted budget gimmick ... may leave our troops short of funding required in the near future.” but representative mac thornberry, chairman of the committee, said that while “some people may call it a gimmick,” the democratic majority in 2008 had done something very similar. the u.s. military has warned repeatedly in recent years that ongoing efforts to trim nearly $1 trillion from projected defense budgets over a decade have forced it to postpone training, maintenance and upkeep. the measure, the national defense authorization act, sets u.s. defense policy and authorizes, but does not appropriate, funding for the pentagon. lawmakers in the house panel expected to vote on the final version early on thursday, after which it will go to the full house of representatives. the draft bill unveiled by thornberry this week would authorize $610.5 billion in defense spending for the 2017 fiscal year beginning in october. that total is in line with the defense spending plan proposed by obama earlier this year. the proposal calls for an active duty army of 480,000 troops, which is 20,000 more than proposed in the president’s budget request. it also seeks significant reforms in the organization of the defense department, including expanding the term and the advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. during debates on the legislation, lawmakers approved an amendment that calls for a senior u.s. defense official to be placed in charge of developing directed energy weapons. the u.s. military hopes directed energy weapons will provide it with an asymmetric advantage over potential rivals, for example enabling it to counter million dollar missiles with a weapon that fires projectiles costing only $25,000.

" the saudi led military coalition fighting in yemen said it will continue to block the main aid route into the country until it is satisfied its houthi opponents cannot use it to bring in weapons. the coalition closed all air, land and sea access to yemen last week following the interception of a missile fired toward the saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran. aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in the country, where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine. ports controlled by yemen s exiled government would reopen soon, the coalition said on sunday in a statement issued by the saudi mission at the united nations. however other ports, including houthi controlled hodeidah   where some 80 percent of yemen s food supplies enter   will remain closed until a u.n. verification regime is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the houthis, the statement said.  the coalition, in consultation and full agreement with the legitimate government, will begin steps related to re opening of airports and ports in yemen to allow the transport of humanitarian and commercial cargo,  the statement said. it said the first steps will start within 24 hours and will include the southern ports of aden and mukalla and the red sea port of al mokha, which are all controlled by hadi s government. the coalition asked u.n. secretary general antonio guterres to send a delegation to riyadh to  review current inspection measures to reinforce and introduce a more effective inspection and verification regime (unvim) aimed at facilitating the flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies and prevent smuggling of weapons, ammunition and missile parts...  saudi arabia has accused arch foe iran of supplying the ballistic missile which was shot down near riyadh airport without causing any casualties. iran has denied the accusation.  the united nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition in the past for blocking aid access, especially to the north, which is held by the iran aligned houthis battling the saudi led coalition. more than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which pits the internationally recognized government, backed by saudi arabia and its allies, against the houthis and forces loyal to former president ali abdullah saleh. the saudi led coalition has been targeting the houthis since they seized parts of yemen in 2015, including the capital sanaa, forcing president abd rabbu mansour hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring saudi arabia.

" american warplanes in afghanistan are dropping bombs in numbers not seen since the height of the u.s. troop surge in 2010, after president donald trump announced a new strategy in august to ease attack curbs and widen the range of militant targets. in september, for example, the u.s. air force dropped 751 bombs, an increase of nearly 50 percent from the august figure of 503, to reach its highest single month total in seven years, military data showed.  the increase can be attributed to the president s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the afghan people,  the air force said in a monthly report. six more f 16 fighter bombers have been deployed to bagram air field north of the afghan capital of kabul, and additional massive b 52 bombers have been assigned to strike afghanistan from bases in the persian gulf, it added. the air force numbers exclude strikes by the u.s. army, which maintains armed helicopters and other aircraft in afghanistan. trump s south asia strategy included promises to expand authority for u.s. forces to target militants in afghanistan.  these killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of american might and americans  arms,  trump said in his august speech unveiling the strategy.  retribution will be fast and powerful.  former president barack obama s plans to drawdown the u.s. mission in afghanistan often limited u.s. troops to attacking the taliban only in certain circumstances, such as self defense. this month, defense secretary james mattis confirmed to congress that those restrictions would be lifted under trump s plan.

" spanish police on friday detained a man they said had a close relationship with a number of those involved in last month s attacks in barcelona when militant islamists used a van to hit pedestrians and carried out a follow up attack, killing 16. the moroccan man, 24, is a resident in spain and had connections to the islamist cell which took part in the attack, especially the imam abdelbaki es satty, the interior ministry said in a statement. police are looking at the man s part in the acquisition of materials, specifically hydrogen peroxide, which was used in the manufacture of some 100 kilos of tatp explosives, the ministry said. the cell had accumulated around 120 canisters of butane gas at a house in a town south of barcelona with which, police said following the attacks, it had planned to carry out a larger bomb attack. a blast that destroyed the house in the town of alcanar on aug. 16, the eve of the barcelona attack, was accidentally triggered by the cell, police say. satty, said to be the leader of the militant group, died in the explosion. six of the suspects were killed by police during the attacks and four have been arrested, with two held in prison.  spanish police have arrested 201 people they claim are associated with militant islamists since raising the alert level to 4, the second highest, in june 2015.

" an international criminal court investigation of possible war crimes by u.s. forces in afghanistan is not “warranted or appropriate,” the u.s. state department said on tuesday after prosecutors in the hague found initial grounds for such a probe. state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau said the united states was not a party to the rome statute that created the international criminal court in the hague and had not consented to icc jurisdiction. she also said washington had a robust justice system able to deal with such complaints. “the united states is deeply committed to complying with the law of war,” trudeau told reporters at a news briefing. “we do not believe that an icc examination or investigation with respect to actions of u.s. personnel in relation to the situation in afghanistan is warranted or appropriate.” her comments came a day after prosecutors at the international criminal court said in a report that there was a “reasonable basis to believe” that u.s. forces had tortured at least 61 prisoners in afghanistan and another 27 at cia detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004. the prosecutors’ office, headed by prosecutor fatou bensouda, said it would decide imminently whether to pursue a  full investigation. the results could lead to charges being brought against individuals and the issuing of arrest warrants. the united states occupied afghanistan in 2001 as it went after al qaeda leaders behind the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington. crimes also may have been committed at u.s. central intelligence agency facilities in poland, lithuania and romania, where some people captured in afghanistan were taken, prosecutors said. the u.s. justice department between 2009 and 2012 investigated cia mistreatment of detainees, including a full criminal investigation into two deaths in u.s. custody, but ultimately decided against prosecuting anyone. some u.s. military personnel have been prosecuted for murder and other crimes in afghanistan.  the icc was established in 1998 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. trudeau noted the united states has “engaged with the icc and we’ve supported icc investigations and prosecution of cases that we believe advance our values in accordance with u.s. law.” but she said the u.s. military was held to “the highest possible standards” and the united states had systems of accountability capable of dealing with war crimes allegations. “we do an extraordinary job of investigating ... credible allegations, holding ourselves accountable, holding our personnel accountable and closing investigations in a manner that serves justice,” she said.

" mexico s newest political force formally emerged on friday when a right left coalition presented its official request with the electoral institute to compete in next year s presidential election.  the coalition, known as  for mexico in front,  brings together the conservative national action party (pan), the center left party of the democratic revolution (prd) and the citizens movement party.  the coalition will compete against the ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri), and leftist frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador, of the national regeneration movement (morena), in next july s vote. president enrique pena nieto is constitutionally barred from running again. with the formalizing of the coalition, the contours of the election are beginning to take shape. nonetheless, it remains to be seen who  for mexico in front  will pick as its candidate.  pan president ricardo anaya is seen as the most likely figure, although mexico city s prd mayor miguel angel mancera is also seen as a contender. former mexican first lady margarita zavala broke with the pan in october in order to run as an independent.  last week, finance minister jose antonio meade resigned to seek the presidential nomination of the pri, which has broken with tradition by seeking outside help to clean up its tarnished image and stay in office for another six years. the pri faces an uphill battle to reclaim the presidency, and is banking on meade, who is not a pri member and has a reputation for honesty, to win over voters tired by years of graft, violence and lackluster growth.

" human rights activists are urging afganistan s president ashraf ghani to expand anti torture laws enacted months ago to allow victims abused by security forces to seek restitution and compensation. a  redress annex  attached to the anti torture law would allow victims to take the government to civil court, something not currently allowed under the law, say activists. the annex has been drafted and its backers hope ghani will sign a decree making it an official part of the law. a spokesman for ghani s office did not respond to requests for comment. as of now, it is up to the government to investigate and prosecute members of its own security forces who are accused of torture, something activists and investigators say is rare.  the pervasiveness of torture in afghanistan makes its criminalization and the prosecution of alleged torturers an urgent priority,  human rights watch senior researcher patricia gossman wrote in a post calling for the annex to be enacted.  but the government also needs to enshrine in law the rights of torture victims to redress for their suffering.  if prosecutors delay,  a compensation system would create a new avenue for holding the government accountable,  she said.    human rights investigators have praised recent moves by ghani s administration to criminalize torture, but at a practical level reports of torture continue to be widespread. in april, a u.n. report said measures by the government had failed to reduce torture, with nearly 40 percent of conflict related detainees interviewed by the investigators reporting that they had been tortured or mistreated by afghan security forces, mostly the police and intelligence services. among the methods described in the report were severe beatings to the body and soles of the feet with sticks, plastic pipes or cables, electric shocks, including to the genitals, prolonged suspension by the arms, and suffocation. allowing victims to sue in civil court would ensure that they receive compensation and create a public record of torture cases, said shaharzad akbar, a civil society activist who works on anti torture causes.  governments across the world are hesitant to prosecute their employees, so redress creates a civil mechanism for the public to hold government accountable,  she said.  this leads to an internal conversation in the government about the responsibility of government entities to prevent torture.

" syrian army forces backed by iranian backed militias pushed deeper into the last rebel held enclave near a strategic border area with israel and lebanon in a new expansion of tehran s influence in the war torn country. the army and the shi ite forces helped by druze militias in the area advanced east and south of the sunni rebel held bastion of beit jin backed by some of the heaviest aerial bombing and artillery shelling since a major assault began more than two months ago to seize the area, rebels said. the syrian army said it had encircled the village of mughr al meer at the foothills of mount hermon as troops moved toward beit jin amid fierce clashes. on monday, the army said they had cut off insurgent supply lines and made further advances.  the enclave is the last rebel bastion left in the southwest of damascus known as the western ghouta that had since last year fallen under government control after months of heavy bombing on civilian areas and years of siege tactics that forced rebels to surrender. a western intelligence source confirmed rebel reports that iranian backed local militias alongside commanders from the powerful lebanese hezbollah shi ite group were playing a major role in the ongoing battles. tehran was pushing to establish a strategic presence along the israeli border in the syrian golan heights, the source said.  rebels said they had repelled several attempts to storm their defenses and denied reports they were about to surrender.  the iranian backed militias are trying to consolidate their sphere of influence all the way from southwest of damascus to the israeli border,  said suhaib al ruhail, an official from the liwa al furqan rebel group that operates in the area. worried by iran s expanding influence in syria after the defeat of islamic state, israel has in recent weeks stepped up its strikes against suspected iranian targets inside syria. early this month there was an israeli strike on a base near kiswah, south of damascus, that was widely believed to be an iranian military compound, a western intelligence source said. israel has been lobbying washington and moscow to deny iran, lebanon s hezbollah and other shi ite militias any permanent bases in syria, and to keep them away from the golan, as they gain ground while helping damascus beat back sunni led rebels. the southwest of syria is part of a de escalation zone in southern syria agreed last july between russia and the united states, the first such understanding between the two powers. the area has not seen russian bombing, unlike other ceasefire areas in syria. diplomatic sources say several thousand shi ite and druze fighters are pitted against hundreds of sunni jihadists and mainstream free syria army (fsa) rebels closing ranks under the banner of itihad quwt jabal al sheikh, or  union of fighters of jabal al sheikh . they are mainly drawn from local fighters from the area. with the army and iranian backed offensive widening, the sunni rebels have called on youths to enlist, while mosque imams in beit jin called on people to take up arms and fight the army. rebels still have a sizeable presence in central and southern quneitra, in the syrian golan heights. western diplomatic sources say the crushing of the sunni rebel presence in areas they have been in since 2013 will allow lebanon s hezbollah to open another secure arms supply line from its border in southern lebanon into syria. since the beginning of the conflict in syria, iran has had a growing presence in the country, deploying thousands of shi ite fighters drawn from iraq and afghanistan who have fought against both mainstream sunni rebel groups and more militant groups.

" german intelligence agencies have warned german companies that iran is still trying to circumvent restrictions on the sale of dual use items for its rocket and missile technology program, according to a document seen by reuters on wednesday. the bfv domestic intelligence agency reminded german firms in the document that sales of certain technologies remained illegal despite sanctions relief triggered by the landmark iran nuclear deal of 2015.  it is important to note that iran continues to pursue an ambitious rocket and missile technology program which is not affected by the sanctions relief,  the document said. it said the reminder was triggered by  current events  but gave no details. german foreign minister sigmar gabriel on monday told reporters that berlin remains concerned about iran s behavior in the middle east and its missile development program, but stressed that tehran was sticking to the nuclear agreement. european countries are scrambling to pull together a package of measures to keep the nuclear deal on track if u.s. president donald trump decertifies the nuclear pact. under that pact, iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief. trump is expected to declare this week that iran is not complying with the pact and to unveil a tough new strategy toward iran. the bfv document said german intelligence agencies were continuing to investigate  intensively  whether iran was attempting to circumvent existing regulations to acquire products or know how in germany. it had reported in june that iran had sharply scaled back efforts to buy items for its nuclear program, but said attempts to buy items for its development program remained unchanged. it gave no details about the number of such attempts.  germany s most populous state and its industrial heartland, north rhine westphalia, provided details in its own intelligence report for 2016 that was released on tuesday. it said it had detected 32 attempts to buy equipment that were probably or definitely proliferation related in 2016, down from a record 141 attempts seen a year earlier. most of those attempts were related to iran s missile program, although some were also linked to pakistan, it said. the lion s share of the cases did not result in delivery of any equipment because state intelligence officials were able to warn companies in time, or companies recognized suspicious inquiries. it said iran used a variety of front companies to acquire items, often sending goods through turkey, the united arab emirates and china.

"read former fbi director james comey s full statement below:statement for the record senate select committee on intelligence james b. comey june 8, 2017chairman burr, ranking member warner, members of the committee. thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. i was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with president-elect and president trump on subjects that i understand are of interest to you. i have not included every detail from my conversations with the president, but, to the best of my recollection, i have tried to include information that may be relevant to the committee.january 6 briefingi first met then-president-elect trump on friday, january 6 in a conference room at trump tower in new york. i was there with other intelligence community (ic) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an ic assessment concerning russian efforts to interfere in the election. at the conclusion of that briefing, i remained alone with the president-elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.the ic leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming president to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the ic should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the president-elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming president, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.the director of national intelligence asked that i personally do this portion of the briefing because i was staying in my position and because the material implicated the fbi s counter-intelligence responsibilities. we also agreed i would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the president-elect. although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the fbi s leadership and i were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new president came into office uncertain about whether the fbi was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.it is important to understand that fbi counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. the bureau s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the united states or to steal our secrets. the fbi uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. sometimes it involves  turning  the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. on occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities.because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the fbi suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. when the fbi develops reason to believe an american has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the fbi will  open an investigation  on that american and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.in that context, prior to the january 6 meeting, i discussed with the fbi s leadership team whether i should be prepared to assure president-elect trump that we were not investigating him personally. that was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. we agreed i should do so if circumstances warranted. during our one-on-one meeting at trump tower, based on president-elect trump s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, i offered that assurance.i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president-elect in a memo. to ensure accuracy, i began to type it on a laptop in an fbi vehicle outside trump tower the moment i walked out of the meeting. creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with mr. trump was my practice from that point forward. this had not been my practice in the past. i spoke alone with president obama twice in person (and never on the phone)   once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. in neither of those circumstances did i memorialize the discussions. i can recall nine one-on-one conversations with president trump in four months   three in person and six on the phone.january 27 dinnerthe president and i had dinner on friday, january 27 at 6:30 pm in the green room at the white house. he had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. it was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although i assumed there would be others.it turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the green room. two navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.the president began by asking me whether i wanted to stay on as fbi director, which i found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped i would stay, and i had assured him that i intended to. he said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse i had taken during the previous year, he would understand if i wanted to walk away.my instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. that concerned me greatly, given the fbi s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.i replied that i loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as director. and then, because the set-up made me uneasy, i added that i was not  reliable  in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. i added that i was not on anybody s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance i said was in his best interest as the president.a few moments later, the president said,  i need loyalty, i expect loyalty.  i didn t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. we simply looked at each other in silence. the conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.at one point, i explained why it was so important that the fbi and the department of justice be independent of the white house. i said it was a paradox: throughout history, some presidents have decided that because  problems  come from justice, they should try to hold the department close. but blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.near the end of our dinner, the president returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad i wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from jim mattis, jeff sessions, and many others. he then said,  i need loyalty.  i replied,  you will always get honesty from me.  he paused and then said,  that s what i want, honest loyalty.  i paused, and then said,  you will get that from me.  as i wrote in the memo i created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase  honest loyalty  differently, but i decided it wouldn t be productive to push it further. the term   honest loyalty   had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.during the dinner, the president returned to the salacious material i had briefed him about on january 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. he said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn t happen. i replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. he said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.as was my practice for conversations with president trump, i wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the fbi.february 14 oval office meetingon february 14, i went to the oval office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the president. he sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. the vice president, deputy director of the cia, director of the national counterterrorism center, secretary of homeland security, the attorney general, and i were in the semi-circle of chairs. i was directly facing the president, sitting between the deputy cia director and the director of nctc. there were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs.the president signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. i stayed in my chair. as the participants started to leave the oval office, the attorney general lingered by my chair, but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. the last person to leave was jared kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. the president then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.when the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying,  i want to talk about mike flynn.  flynn had resigned the previous day. the president began by saying flynn hadn t done anything wrong in speaking with the russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the vice president. he added that he had other concerns about flynn, which he did not then specify.the president then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information   a concern i shared and still share. after he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, reince priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and i could see a group of people waiting behind him. the president waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. the door closed.the president then returned to the topic of mike flynn, saying,  he is a good guy and has been through a lot.  he repeated that flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the russians, but had misled the vice president. he then said,  i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting flynn go. he is a good guy. i hope you can let this go.  i replied only that  he is a good guy.  (in fact, i had a positive experience dealing with mike flynn when he was a colleague as director of the defense intelligence agency at the beginning of my term at fbi.) i did not say i would  let this go. the president returned briefly to the problem of leaks. i then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including mr. priebus and the vice president.i immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about flynn and discussed the matter with fbi senior leadership. i had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the russian ambassador in december. i did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into russia or possible links to his campaign. i could be wrong, but i took him to be focusing on what had just happened with flynn s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. regardless, it was very concerning, given the fbi s role as an independent investigative agency.the fbi leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the president s request, which we did not intend to abide. we also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. we concluded it made little sense to report it to attorney general sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in russia-related investigations. (he did so two weeks later.) the deputy attorney general s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a united states attorney, who would also not be long in the role.after discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. the investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members   or the department of justice lawyers supporting them   aware of the president s request.shortly afterwards, i spoke with attorney general sessions in person to pass along the president s concerns about leaks. i took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me. i told the ag that what had just happened   him being asked to leave while the fbi director, who reports to the ag, remained behind   was inappropriate and should never happen. he did not reply. for the reasons discussed above, i did not mention that the president broached the fbi s potential investigation of general flynn.march 30 phone callon the morning of march 30, the president called me at the fbi. he described the russia investigation as  a cloud  that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. he said he had nothing to do with russia, had not been involved with hookers in russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in russia. he asked what we could do to  lift the cloud.  i responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn t find anything, to our having done the work well. he agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.then the president asked why there had been a congressional hearing about russia the previous week   at which i had, as the department of justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between russia and the trump campaign. i explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in congress for more information, and that senator grassley had even held up the confirmation of the deputy attorney general until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. i explained that we had briefed the leadership of congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating president trump. i reminded him i had previously told him that. he repeatedly told me,  we need to get that fact out.  (i did not tell the president that the fbi and the department of justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on president trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)the president went on to say that if there were some  satellite  associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn t done anything wrong and hoped i would find a way to get it out that we weren t investigating him.in an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, saying he hadn t brought up  the mccabe thing  because i had said mccabe was honorable, although mcauliffe was close to the clintons and had given him (i think he meant deputy director mccabe s wife) campaign money. although i didn t understand why the president was bringing this up, i repeated that mr. mccabe was an honorable person.he finished by stressing  the cloud  that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped i could find a way to get out that he wasn t being investigated. i told him i would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.immediately after that conversation, i called acting deputy attorney general dana boente (ag sessions had by then recused himself on all russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the president, and said i would await his guidance. i did not hear back from him before the president called me again two weeks later.april 11 phone callon the morning of april 11, the president called me and asked what i had done about his request that i  get out  that he is not personally under investigation. i replied that i had passed his request to the acting deputy attorney general, but i had not heard back. he replied that  the cloud  was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. he said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the acting deputy attorney general. i said that was the way his request should be handled. i said the white house counsel should contact the leadership of doj to make the request, which was the traditional channel.he said he would do that and added,  because i have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.  i did not reply or ask him what he meant by  that thing.  i said only that the way to handle it was to have the white house counsel call the acting deputy attorney general. he said that was what he would do and the call ended.that was the last time i spoke with president trump.",1
" mexican president enrique pena nieto on wednesday told donald trump that mexico would not pay for the republican presidential candidate’s proposed wall along the mexico u.s. border, contradicting trump’s assertion they didn’t discuss payment. “what the president said is that mexico, as he has said on several occasions ... will not pay for that wall,” presidential spokesman eduardo sanchez told reuters by telephone. trump earlier told a joint news conference with pena nieto after their meeting in mexico city that the pair had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it.

" when donald trump started thinking during his campaign for the presidency last year about filling a supreme court vacancy, he turned to a group of washington insiders at the controls of a well oiled machine that puts conservative judges on the bench. that disciplined network of operatives, shepherded by judicial activist leonard leo, on friday delivered for trump his first major accomplishment as u.s. president: the confirmation of conservative neil gorsuch as a supreme court justice.  unlike the chaotic rollouts of other trump policy initiatives, the gorsuch nomination went relatively smoothly. democrats put up a fight in the senate, but they lacked the votes to block the republican majority and they lost. other key players included experienced washington hands such as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, former senator kelly ayotte and white house counsel don mcgahn.  “it worked because it was all planned out before the nomination. we know what works, what doesn’t work, what resources we need. we know the other side’s arguments and how to answer them. it’s like war,” leo told reuters on friday. the only surprise stumble in the effort came when trump attacked judges who blocked his order banning u.s. entry by people from certain muslim majority countries. gorsuch distanced himself from the president’s twitter messages. other than that, discipline was maintained from the first of five meetings that leo, a veteran of bush era judicial confirmation battles, attended with trump. the two met twice before the election.  leo helped compile a list of potential nominees for trump. that helped win over conservative activists unsure of trump’s ideological compass at a time when he was still fighting for the republican presidential nomination. a second, longer list came in september. it included gorsuch, a federal judge. the campaign for gorsuch’s confirmation would not have happened without mcconnell, who stopped former president barack obama, a democrat, from filling the high court vacancy created when conservative icon antonin scalia died in february 2016. after trump won the election, he named mcgahn, a washington based campaign finance lawyer at jones day, as white house counsel. known by his colleagues as “the quiet man,” mcgahn managed the nomination from inside the administration. leo, who reported to mcgahn, pushed back against democrats’ claims that trump basically out sourced the nomination process to outside groups. leo said mcgahn carefully scrutinized the lists of nominees and was not simply a rubber stamp. the gorsuch campaign got heavy marketing and promotion backing from the judicial crisis network (jcn), a coordinating body for conservative and grassroots groups. it launched $10 million in pro gorsuch advertising, targeting in particular senate democrats facing re election contests in 2018.  the jcn was born during the administration of former president george w. bush, when republicans realized a strong outside campaign was critical to getting conservatives on the court.  carrie severino, the group’s chief counsel, said the fact trump agreed to stick to the nominees list made her job easier. “we were prepared for several possibilities, and we had ads, websites, research packets, and much more ready to launch the moment a name was confirmed,” she said. leo said conservatives have borrowed techniques from the liberal coalitions that worked to defeat the nomination of robert bork by republican then president ronald reagan in 1987. the jcn also tapped social media and communications professionals. washington public relations heavyweight ron bonjean played a role, reporting to white house press secretary sean spicer.  at the white house, mcgahn and a team in his office held “murder boards” where gorsuch was bombarded with questions senators might ask. legislative affairs director marc short and his team organized visits with senators and worked with ayotte. asked to accompany gorsuch around capitol hill, ayotte accepted, she said in an interview. ayotte had lost her re election bid in november and had criticized trump. but she helped arrange meetings for gorsuch with almost 80 senators. in the end, said sources close to the gorsuch effort, it worked because it was highly regimented. leo said the machine that got gorsuch on the bench is here to stay although he will return to his job as executive vice president of the federalist society, a conservative lawyers’ group. leo hopes trump will tap that machine for a possible second nomination during his presidency. “supreme court confirmations have become full blown political campaigns,” he said.

" a judge of south sudan s supreme court resigned on tuesday, saying a lack of independence from the executive had turned the judiciary into a  mockery  and complaining of poor working conditions. all of south sudan s judges went on a five month strike in may over poor pay, raising the risk of impunity in a country already convulsed by criminality and war. south sudan, the world s youngest country, descended into civil war in 2013 after president salva kiir fired his deputy, unleashing a conflict that has spawned a patchwork of armed factions.  the independence of the judiciary, in the republic of south sudan, has become a mockery,  kukurlopita marino pitia, a supreme court judge, said in his resignation letter.  the war in south sudan cannot be used as an excuse to interfere and silence and silence the judiciary,  pitia said, adding that the judiciary was expected to protect many rights that are jeopardized by conflict. government officials were not available immediately for  comment on his letter. the conflict in south sudan has slashed oil revenues and paralyzed agriculture, spurring hyperinflation that has rendered many civil servants  salaries almost worthless. arop malueth, secretary for the steering committee for judges and the justice union, told reuters that two more judges from the lower courts had also resigned.  many of us feel that the judiciary is not independent as it should be,  malueth said, adding that some judges had been dismissed unconstitutionally, at the behest of the executive. ex army chief separately, the government said on tuesday the former chief of the army, general paul malong, would be allowed to leave the country, six months after placing him under house arrest in the capital following a falling out with president kiir. kiir s spokesman ateny wek ateny told un radio in south sudan that malong was free to go to any country for medical treatment  on grounds of humanity . malong led the army s war effort against rebels from 2014 but kiir sacked him in may and placed him under house arrest. earlier this month, kiir sent troops to disarm malong s bodyguards at his house in juba, but they refused. kiir s troops then surrounded malong s house, sparking fears of clashes, before withdrawing a week later. malong is under u.s. sanctions and has been accused, along with kiir, by a u.n. panel of experts of leading troops who murdered and raped civilians during the civil war.(this version of the story was refiled to correct reporter s name in signoff) ",0
" president donald trump will be presented with multiple options regarding the future of the iran nuclear deal ahead of an oct. 15 deadline to certify whether tehran is complying with the pact, secretary of state rex tillerson said on wednesday. tillerson did not disclose details about the kinds of options he will present to trump. he also declined to directly answer a question about whether he shared defense secretary jim mattis  assessment to congress on tuesday that iran was  fundamentally  in compliance with the accord.  we ll have a recommendation for the president. we re going to give him a couple of options of how to move forward to advance the important policy toward iran,  tillerson told reporters at the state department. a collapse of the 2015 deal, which trump has called  an embarrassment,  but which is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran, could trigger a regional arms race and stoke middle east tensions. a senior u.s. official said last month that trump was leaning toward not certifying that iran is complying with the pact. trump himself has said he already had made up his mind whether to keep the pact, but has declined to disclose his decision. if trump declines to certify iran s compliance, u.s. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran suspended under the accord. unlike mattis, who publicly suggested trump should consider sticking with the agreement, tillerson has been highly critical of the accord and said it must be changed. he has taken aim at the deal s so called sunset clauses, under which some of the restrictions on iran s nuclear program expire over time. tillerson on wednesday suggested that whatever path the united states chooses on the nuclear accord known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), it would only represent one component of america s broader policy toward iran.  the jcpoa represents only a small part of the many issues that we need to deal with when it comes to the iranian relationship,  he said.  so it is an important part of that, but is not the only part. and i ve said many times, we cannot let the iranian relationship be defined solely by that nuclear agreement.

" donald trump, the new york businessman seeking the republican u.s. presidential nomination, said on tuesday he felt “a tinge” of disappointment after losing to texas senator ted cruz in the iowa caucuses. cruz bested trump with 28 percent of caucus goers’ pledges on monday compared to trump’s 24 percent. florida senator marco rubio came in a close third with 23 percent. asked by a reporter if he felt at all bad about the result, trump said, “there’s a tinge...i probably had a tinge because a poll came out that said i was five points ahead.”  in the weeks before the iowa caucuses, trump held leads in almost every statewide and national poll though his dominance in iowa wobbled after cruz won a key endorsement from a local evangelical christian leader. trump also said there was a chance his decision to skip a fox news debate among republican candidates on thursday might have hurt him in the caucuses. asked before a rally in milford, new hampshire on tuesday evening if he planned to change his campaign strategy, trump told a news conference he felt confident in his methods, but he was adding more town hall style events. but any humility was fleeting as trump went on to say he beat rubio by getting support from almost 3,000 iowans   “that’s a lot of people”   and that he had gotten a larger percentage of support than any other republican candidate in history “except for that one number,” he added, referring to cruz’s win. he also said he had not tried very hard to win iowa. “i didn’t devote tremendous time to it,” he said. “i didn’t expect to do so well.” trump fielded question after question from reporters about why he thought he lost and whether it made him anxious about primary elections in other states ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. when he took the stage before more than a thousand people, trump’s swagger had returned. he criticized the media for focusing more on rubio’s third place showing than his second, calling journalists “miserable people” and encouraging the crowd to boo them. fans interviewed before the rally said trump’s loss did not bother them.  “i think he’s done pretty well from the start,” said eli johnson, 33, from nearby brookline, new hampshire. “he did pretty well considering cruz was praying with everyone at every rally (in iowa) and they’re a really religious state.” ",0

" president barack obama on friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of u.s. gay rights, the 1969 stonewall riots in new york city, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay americans. the stonewall inn gay bar in manhattan’s greenwich village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the american mainstream and guarantee their rights. “welcome to the family,” the national park service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site. lgbt rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities’ continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the june 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in florida that killed 49 people. “this new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate,” human rights campaign president chad griffin said. the move was the latest of several steps obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency.  in 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the u.s. military. in 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. his administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 u.s. supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. “there is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity,” obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site. the events of late june and early july 1969 in new york helped start the modern american gay rights movement. a week of violent clashes on christopher street between patrons of the stonewall inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the stonewall riots. the crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. but it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970. this year’s weekend lgbt pride festivities started in new york on friday with a street fair and were to culminate with sunday’s parade through lower manhattan. events were scheduled across the country in san francisco, minneapolis, oklahoma city and elsewhere. obama’s designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the stonewall inn and nearby christopher park. u.s. lawmakers representing new york, in a statement, called the site “a beacon for liberation.” it drew renewed attention in the wake of this month’s massacre in orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called pulse. mourners in new york flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern u.s. history.  in honor of the new monument, the white house will release a video that will be played on billboards in new york’s times square on saturday. u.s. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at stonewall on monday.

" a u.s. judge in ohio ordered republican presidential candidate donald trump’s campaign on friday not to intimidate voters as voting rights advocates scored a string of last minute victories in several politically competitive states. the ruling by u.s. district court judge james gwin creates the possibility of fines or jail time for trump allies who harass voters, a significant victory for democrats who had worried the real estate mogul was encouraging supporters to cause mayhem at the polls on nov. 8. the ruling also deals a blow to a trump aligned “exit poll” that seeks to mobilize thousands of supporters. the trump campaign appealed the decision. on the campaign trail, trump has warned that the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities.  democrats have launched a legal blitz in ohio and five other battleground states to prevent that from happening. they are also trying to stop a paramilitary group, the oath keepers, from conducting its own monitoring operation.  numerous studies have found that u.s. voter fraud is exceedingly rare. voting rights advocates also won legal victories in three other states on friday, building on a string of decisions that have rolled back election restrictions across the country. in arizona, a federal judge suspended a state law that prohibits advocates’ ability to collect absentee ballots. “having more options to turn in your ballot ensures that more people take part in the democratic process,” said spencer scharff, voter protection director of the arizona democratic party. in north carolina, a judge ordered election officials to restore the voting rights of thousands who had been removed from registration lists in recent weeks. and in kansas, a state court blocked a dual registration system that would have prevented 20,000 registered voters from casting ballots for local offices because they were unable to prove u.s. citizenship. the ohio ruling does not prevent the state republican party from sending trained volunteers into polling places to make sure election laws are being followed.  however, it does impose restrictions on trump supporters who take it on themselves to monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go.  many of those activities are already illegal, but the judge’s order means that anybody who engages in them could be held in contempt of court, exposing them to additional civil or criminal penalties. “it backs the law with the power of contempt,” said rick hasen, an election law expert at the university of california at irvine. the order also deals a blow to a trump allied “exit poll” that aims to mobilize supporters to canvass voters in an effort to sniff out instances of voter manipulation. the organizer of that effort, republican operative roger stone, told reuters he would fight the ruling regardless of the outcome of the election. “the democrats’ lawyers have perjured themselves and perpetrated a fraud before the court,” he wrote in a text message. the order also applies to democrats, who have focused their efforts on making sure their supporters can vote. “with this decision, ohioans can feel confident that they will be able to make their voices heard in this election,” ohio democratic party chairman david pepper said in a prepared statement. the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

" britain s prince harry and u.s. actress meghan markle announced on monday they were getting married next year, saying their relationship had blossomed  incredibly quickly  after meeting on a blind date. harry, 33, queen elizabeth s grandson and fifth in line to the british throne, and markle, 36, best known for her role in the u.s. tv legal drama  suits , said they had got engaged in london this month and will wed in the spring next year.   the fact that i fell in love with meghan so incredibly quickly was confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned, everything was just perfect. this beautiful woman just tripped and fell into my life, i fell into her life,  harry said in a broadcast interview. [l8n1nx5ae] the queen, who had to give her assent for the union, and her husband prince philip were delighted, buckingham palace said, while harry also received the blessing of markle s parents.  we re thrilled. i hope they will be very happy indeed,  his father, heir to the throne prince charles said. harry and markle, who is a divorcee, met in july 2016 after they were introduced through a mutual friend, with both knowing little about the other.  i had never watched suits, i had never heard of meghan before and i was beautifully surprised when i walked into that room and saw her. i was like i m going to really up my game here,  harry said. after just two dates, the couple decided to go on holiday together to botswana but it was only months later that the prince, the younger son of charles and his first wife princess diana, publicly confirmed their relationship in a rebuke to the media over its alleged intrusion into markle s private life.   i did not have any understanding of just what it would be like,  she said.  both of us were totally surprised by the reaction,  added harry, who said they had had a frank conversation about what she was letting herself in for. it was not until september this year that they made their first public appearance together at the invictus games in toronto, a sports event for wounded veterans. earlier the couple posed for photographs in the grounds of kensington palace in central london where the couple will live in a cottage. asked when he knew markle was  the one , he replied:  the very first time we met.  markle showed off a dazzling three stone ring, designed by harry himself with at its center a diamond from botswana surrounded by two diamonds taken from the personal collection of his late mother diana. harry said she would have been  thick as thieves  with markle.  it s so important to me to know that she s a part of this with us,  markle said. the wedding is likely to attract huge attention across the world, as did the marriage of harry s elder brother william to  kate middleton in 2011.  we are very excited for harry and meghan,  william and kate said in a statement.  it has been wonderful getting to know meghan and to see how happy she and harry are together.   in his office s warning to the media, harry referred to the sexism and racism directed at markle, whose father is white and  her mother african american.  we are incredibly happy for meghan and harry. our daughter has always been a kind and loving person,  markle s parents thomas markle and doria ragland said in a statement.  to see her union with harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. we wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together.  educated at the exclusive eton college, harry s teenage years were overshadowed by negative headlines, fostering an intense dislike which he and his brother harbored because of the way papers hounded their mother. she died in a paris car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi. harry was portrayed as a royal wild child and playboy prince, and in 2002 he admitted smoking cannabis and getting drunk when underage in a pub near the royal family s country estate amid suggestions he had fallen in with a bad crowd. he later scuffled with paparazzi outside a london nightclub and drew outrage by dressing as a nazi officer at a party. but he turned around his image after joining the army, where he spent 10 years and included two tours of duty in afghanistan. he said it was a role where he felt he could be himself without media scrutiny or any other trappings of his gilded upbringing. even when he was photographed partying naked and playing billiards in a private room in las vegas in 2012, the response was less critical and more understanding. he left the army in 2015 to focus on royal duties and charity work, particularly the welfare of military veterans, and continuing his mother s work helping those with aids, and mental health issues. his easy going manner with the public has made him one of the most popular members of the windsors. that has put him at the forefront of a rebranding of the monarchy as modern and relevant, a far cry from the perception of a hopelessly out of touch institution following the 1997 death of diana. to coincide with the 20th anniversary of her death this year, harry opened up about his own trauma at losing his mother at a young age, and was even quoted as saying he wanted out of the royal family altogether. like william s wife kate, meghan will not become a princess in her own right after marrying harry. however, harry, like his brother, is likely to be made a duke when he marries, meaning meghan would become a duchess. markle was born in los angeles in 1981. her father was a tv lighting director for soaps and sitcoms and her mother a clinical therapist. she made her first tv appearance in a 2002 episode of medical drama  general hospital  has appeared in a number of tv shows and films, such as  horrible bosses , but achieved greatest fame for her starring part as rachel zane in the ongoing  suits  series.  in 2011, she married film producer trevor engelson but they divorced two years later. she had her own lifestyle blog thetig.com, which she recently shut down, and like her future husband has become a prominent humanitarian campaigner. she also criticized u.s. president donald trump in a tv interview before last year s u.s. election, calling him misogynistic. britain s royals are traditionally supposed to avoid making any political interventions and harry said he had confidence that his wife to be would be able to handle the pressures her role would bring.  i know the fact that she ll be unbelievably good at the job part as well is obviously a huge relief to me because she ll be able to deal with everything else that comes with it,  he said.  we re a fantastic team. we know we are.

" aid agencies have to step up operations  massively  in response to the arrival in bangladesh of about 400,000 refugees fleeing violence in myanmar, and the amount of money needed to help them has risen sharply, a senior u.n. official said on wednesday. the exodus of muslim rohingya to bangladesh began on aug. 25 after rohingya militants attacked about 30 police posts and an army camp. the attacks triggered a sweeping military counter offensive by security forces in buddhist majority myanmar which the u.n. rights agency said was a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  we will all have to ramp up our response massively, from food to shelter,  george william okoth obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the u.n. refugee agency, told reuters during a visit to the kutupalong refugee camp in bangladesh.  the united nations said on tuesday 370,000 people had crossed into bangladesh but okoth obbo estimated the figure was now 400,000. he declined to speculate on how many more might come. bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 rohingya, who fled earlier conflict in myanmar including a similar security crackdown in western myanmar s rakhine state in response to militant attacks in october. many of the new arrivals are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season.  we have an emergency within an emergency with conditions in existing camps,  he said, pointing to a mud clogged road in the camp. last week, the united nations appealed for $77 million to cope with the crisis but okoth obbo said that would not now be enough.  the appeal that was issued of $77 million on behalf of the aid agencies was based on the situation as it was roughly about two weeks ago,  he said.  there were only 100,000 people then. we are already four times that figure now. the funds need clearly is going to continue.  he declined to say how much he thought was needed. he also declined to say if he thought aid agencies were getting proper access to the conflict zone in myanmar, though he said it was important to ensure that people were safe where they were.  of course, also that access is provided to all the responders to provide humanitarian assistance,  he added. myanmar has restricted most aid agency access to the north of rakhine. some officials have accused aid agencies of supporting the insurgents. okoth obbo said he agreed with the bangladeshi position that the most important solution was for the refugees to be able to return home in safety. bangladeshi prime minister sheikh hasina said on tuesday the refugees would all have to go home and myanmar should set up safe zones to enable them to do so.  under difficult circumstances this country has kept its borders open,  okoth obbo said of bangladesh.  all of us should support that and ensure that the response is strong.

" malaysia said on tuesday it has received proposals from three companies offering to continue the search for malaysian airlines flight mh370, which has been missing since 2014, but no decision has been made yet. mh370 vanished three years ago somewhere in the southern indian ocean en route to beijing from kuala lumpur with 239 people aboard. its disappearance has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries. malaysian transport minister liow tiong lai said proposals were received from u.s. based seabed exploration firm ocean infinity, dutch firm fugro and an unidentified malaysian company.  we wont be deciding anything now on whether we are embarking on a new search or not,  liow told reporters on the sidelines of an event in kuala lumpur.  we have to discuss with the companies. it will take some time as it s some detailed discussions,  he said. liow was commenting on media reports from australia that said malaysia could resume the search as early as this week. australia, malaysia and china called off a a$200 million ($159.16 million), two year search for the plane in january, amid protests from families of those onboard. liow said the proposals would eventually be presented to the other countries in the tripartite committee   china and australia   before a decision was taken. representatives for ocean infinity have said the company would only want to be paid if the aircraft was found. the boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on march 8, 2014, and is thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern indian ocean before crashing off the coast of western australia.

" the philippine congress approved a bill that removes a proposed 900 million pesos ($17.87 million) for the police war on drugs, now that police are no longer leading the operation, but which provides them with body cameras to record arrests. senator loren legarda, the head of senate s finance committee, said on monday that congress re allotted the police requested budget because the drug enforcement agency was now leading the controversial war on drugs in which thousand of suspected dealers and users have been killed. the bill, approved by congress last week, is expected to be endorsed by president rodrigo duterte, who launched the crackdown, on tuesday. duterte this month ordered the police to return to the drugs war, following a near eight week layoff, but in a supporting role only. most of the money steered away from the war on drugs would go towards military and police housing, and the balance would be used to buy body cameras for police engaged in anti drug operations.  maybe they would be fearful if they are monitored, to lessen if not totally eliminate untoward incidents,  legarda told the anc news channel. the anti narcotics crackdown has drawn international criticism, with rights groups pointing out lapses in police operations and alleged executions of drug suspects. police say they have shot dead more than 3,900 drug suspects in self defence during the 17 month campaign, but surveys have showed doubts among filipinos about the validity of police accounts.

" the u.n. subcommittee on torture prevention has suspended a  visit to rwanda, citing obstructions imposed by the government that compromised its fact finding mission. rwandan authorities barred the u.n. delegation from accessing some detention sites and made it impossible for them to conduct  private and confidential interviews , a statement from the u.n. body published on friday said.  the body said it was only the third time in 10 years it had suspended a mission. it called on rwanda to cooperate with the body and  abide by its international obligations . the incident further mars the human rights record of the government led by president paul kagame, which faces mounting criticism for what human rights groups say are widespread abuses, a muzzling of independent media, and suppression of political opposition. the u.n. body said the people the group interviewed before suspending its seven day mission said they feared reprisals.  we must not place the persons that have cooperated with us in danger,  it said. the rwandan authorities were not immediately available for a comment, but it has denied accusations of unlawful detention and torture documented most recently by human rights watch in a report published this month. the report said the government routinely tortured detainees with beatings, asphyxiations, mock executions and electric shocks. a prominent critic of rwandan president who was barred from running for presidency, diane shima rwigara, was detained in kigali in september and faces charges of forgery of electoral documents and inciting insurrection.  she said in court last week said that her family and supporters were subjected to torture. judges have said they will rule on her bail request on monday.

" president donald trump on monday dismissed allegations in a new lawsuit by prominent constitutional and ethics lawyers that he is violating the u.s. constitution by letting his hotels and other businesses accept payments from foreign governments. trump told reporters at the white house that the lawsuit filed earlier in the day by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington was “without merit.” the nonprofit watchdog said trump is “submerged in conflicts of interest” from his ties to countries such as china, india and potentially russia, and that payments for such things as hotel rooms and office leases posed conflicts of interest for him. its lawsuit seeks to stop trump from accepting any improper payments, saying a constitutional provision known as the “emoluments” clause bans them. as the constitution’s framers were aware, “private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders, and entanglements between american officials and foreign powers could pose a creeping, insidious threat to the republic,” crew said in its complaint. the lawsuit was filed in u.s. district court in manhattan. it is part of a wave of expected litigation from liberal advocacy groups against trump, a republican who took office on friday. on jan. 11, trump said he would retain ownership of his global business empire while president, but hand off day to day control to his oldest sons, eric and donald jr.. sheri dillon, a trump adviser and partner at the law firm morgan lewis & bockius, said at the time the emoluments clause applies to gifts, rather than ordinary business payments such as hotel bills. she also said that profit generated by trump’s hotels from foreign governments would be donated to the u.s. treasury. but crew said trump’s refusal to cede ownership or set up a blind trust, as urged by the u.s. office of government ethics, leaves him “poised” to violate the constitution repeatedly while in the white house. the emoluments clause forbids trump and other u.s. officeholders from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. u.s. district judge ronnie abrams, an appointee of former democratic president barack obama, will preside over crew’s lawsuit. jay wexler, a professor at boston university school of law, said “the substantive claim is certainly reasonable,” but that courts such as abrams’ may decide not to get involved. “either it will find that the plaintiff lacks standing, or alternatively that the claim presents a political question and that it should not weigh in on the merits,” wexler said. natalie gewargis, a spokeswoman for morgan lewis, which represents trump on ethics matters, said: “we do not comment on our clients or the work we do for them.” crew’s lawsuit challenges such payments for such things as office space leased by the state owned industrial and commercial bank of china at trump tower in new york, rounds at trump’s golf courses, and the rights to rebroadcast or create new versions of trump’s reality tv show “the apprentice.” china, india, indonesia, turkey and the united kingdom are among the countries with which trump’s companies do or plan to do business, and trump had been trying to do business with russia for at least three decades, the complaint said. meanwhile, payments for a washington hotel booking next month by the embassy of kuwait for its “national day” celebration are expected to “go directly to defendant while he is president,” the complaint added. to show it has standing to sue, crew claimed it has been “significantly injured” by having to divert resources to the lawsuit, and field hundreds of media questions about trump’s businesses. among the lawyers who worked on the complaint were constitutional scholars laurence tribe of harvard university, and erwin chemerinsky, dean of the university of california at irvine’s law school. others include two former top white house ethics lawyers: norman eisen, who advised obama; and richard painter, who advised the republican george w. bush.

" chancellor angela merkel s social democrat (spd) challenger said on sunday his party would not form any alliances after a sept. 24 election unless fair wages, free education, secure pensions and a commitment to a democratic europe were guaranteed. the spd was trailing merkel s conservatives by 13 points in an emnid poll published on saturday, with 24 percent support. polls show the most likely coalitions are a re run of the current conservative spd alliance or a  jamaica  tie up of the conservatives, greens and pro business free democrats (fdp). for the first time, spd leader martin schulz on sunday laid out his conditions for joining any coalitions in a video broadcast on the party s website.  specific policies for fair wages, good schools, secure pensions and a democratic europe for peace   that s what i promise you,  61 year old schulz said.  an spd government would implement these plans. they re non negotiable for me. that s why i want to become german chancellor,  he said. but polls suggest the spd s only option for gaining power would be as a junior partner in another  grand coalition  with the conservatives under merkel. schulz has put social justice at the core of his campaign, but that has failed to gain much traction. germans have generally enjoyed 12 years of prosperity under merkel, and she has trumpeted her economic achievements   such as reducing unemployment   throughout the campaign. in an interview with the funke newspaper group, schulz said he was against a re run of the current coalition, an alliance that is always a last resort because it leaves little opposition in parliament.  we re not seeking to continue the grand coalition,  he said.  i m running to supersede merkel.  merkel warned supporters at a campaign rally in the northwestern town of delbrueck on sunday that the election result was not yet clear despite her lead in the polls.  a lot of people say the vote is practically decided already ... but it is not,  she said, adding that many people would make up their minds in the final days before the vote. she had on saturday called for a high election turnout, saying:  we must fight for every single person to go and vote.  germany s smaller parties narrowed down possible coalition options over the weekend, with both the greens and the fdp saying they could not imagine a  jamaica  coalition, the name refers to the black, yellow and green colors of the jamaican flag.

" competing efforts to end south sudan s civil war allow the government to exploit divisions among international brokers and are unlikely to halt the fighting, a confidential u.n. report said.  south sudan became the world s newest nation when it gained independence from sudan in 2011. war broke out in late 2013 and has forced more than a quarter of its 12 million population have fled their homes.   the hostilities in south sudan continue against a complex backdrop of competing regional and bilateral initiatives to resolve the conflict,  u.n. sanctions monitors said in a report to the security council seen by reuters on friday.   these efforts suffer from several defects, including inadequate oversight, lack of enforcement and the absence of an integrated, coherent plan for peace.   among the international bodies involved in trying to bring the warring parties to the table are regional bloc igad, the u.n. security council, a troika of south sudan s main western backers prior to independence, and an african union panel.  the efforts of these groups are affected by  conflicting interests compounded by underlying rivalries in the region , the panel wrote, in what could refer to the role of leaders such as uganda s yoweri museveni, who deployed troops in 2013 to support the juba government and opposes an arms embargo.  the government of south sudan has sought to exploit this division  among the competing efforts, the panel said.  absent a significant shift toward a more coherent and unified approach  from east african nations, coupled with  broader international support for a single and inclusive political process, current efforts are unlikely to ... halt the violence in south sudan,  it said. information minister michael makuei lueth told reporters in juba:  there is nothing new in this report.  the leaked report is by a panel mandated to document arms flows and security threats. the proliferation of diplomatic efforts has created an opportunity for parties to  forum shop , the panel wrote, saying this bought the armed groups time to organize military operations and avoid attempts to enforce a settlement.      it noted the military was still able to procure weapons while opposition forces  access to arms  remains limited .  the main opposition figure, riek machar, is under house arrest in south africa and has declined to renounce violence. kiir continues to buy weapons and government forces continue to attack civilians, the report said.   east african leaders said in june they want the warring sides to recommit to the deal they abandoned more than a year ago. in july, western donors said the process was no longer viable and froze support for it.  there has been no comment in recent months from igad or the african union about a timeline for resumption of peace talks.  this week the united states imposed sanctions on two senior south sudanese officials and the former army chief. the security council last december vetoed the imposition of an arms embargo recommended by the monitors.

" the united states has sent a reinforced detachment of fighter planes to police the skies over nato members lithuania, latvia and estonia during a major russian military exercise in the baltic region next month. the zapad war games from sept. 14 to 20 in belarus, western russia and russia s exclave of kaliningrad, have caused unease in the region, though russia has said the large scale exercise will rehearse a purely defensive scenario and will not be a springboard for invasion. seven u.s. f 15c fighters landed at siauliai airfield this week to patrol skies over the baltic countries, three more than normally used since the nato policing mission was upgraded after the crimean crisis in 2014.   the three baltic states do not operate their own fighter aircraft and rely on their nato allies for patrols.  we are reinforcing the air police mission for the period (of zapad). and we are glad to also have additional land troops here,  lithuanian deputy defense minister vytautas umbrasas told reporters at siauliai, referring to 600 extra u.s. airborne troops being deployed during zapad in the baltic states.  this is very helpful in a situation like this,  he said. tod wolters, the top u.s. air force commander in europe, said fighter numbers had been increased due to  training opportunities  in lithuania, without mentioning russia during the news conference in siauliai.  the air policing mission will remain as it has been. and the purpose of the air policing mission is to protect the sovereign skies of the three baltic nations,  said wolters. moscow says almost 13,000 russian and belarussian servicemen will take part in zapad, as well as around 70 planes and helicopters and 700 pieces of military hardware including tanks, artillery and rocket systems. lieutenant general ben hodges, the u.s. army s top general in europe, told reuters last month that u.s. allies in eastern europe and ukraine were worried the exercises could be a  trojan horse  aimed at leaving behind military equipment brought into belarus. a russian deputy defense minister said on tuesday there was no truth in allegations russia would use the exercise as a cover to invade and occupy lithuania, poland or ukraine. suggestions that russia posed a threat were  myths , the deputy minister, alexander fomin, said. three u.s. exercises will be underway at the same time as zapad, in sweden, poland and ukraine, and a u.s. armored brigade has already deployed in europe.

" the state of hawaii renewed its bid to narrow president donald trump’s temporary travel ban, following court rulings which said the state had taken the wrong procedural approach in attempts to challenge the administration’s policy earlier this week. in a court filing late on friday, hawaii’s attorney general asked a honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the united states. the u.s. supreme court last month let the ban on travel from six muslim majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible “bona fide relationship” with a u.s. person or entity. the trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen would be barred.  trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. however, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against muslims. earlier this week hawaii had asked a honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the supreme court’s ruling to allow grandparents into the united states. the judge, along with the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the supreme court’s opinion. however, the 9th circuit on friday said the courts could issue an injunction against trump’s policy in the future, if the government misapplied the supreme court’s ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. hours after that ruling, hawaii made such an injunction request in a honolulu federal court. hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by trump’s guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. a justice department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  the roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in january when trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. that sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

" u.s. president donald trump’s son in law and close adviser, jared kushner, had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the russian ambassador to the united states during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, seven current and former u.s. officials told reuters. those contacts included two phone calls between april and november last year, two of the sources said. by early this year, kushner had become a focus of the fbi investigation into whether there was any collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin, said two other sources   one current and one former law enforcement official.  kushner initially had come to the attention of fbi investigators last year as they began scrutinizing former national security adviser michael flynn’s connections with russian officials, the two sources said. while the fbi is investigating kushner’s contacts with russia, he is not currently a target of that investigation, the current law enforcement official said. the new information about the two calls as well as other details uncovered by reuters shed light on when and why kushner first attracted fbi attention and show that his contacts with russian envoy sergei kislyak were more extensive than the white house has acknowledged.  nbc news reported on thursday that kushner was under scrutiny by the fbi, in the first sign that the investigation, which began last july, has reached the president’s inner circle.   the fbi declined to comment, while the russian embassy said it was policy not to comment on individual diplomatic contacts. the white house did not respond to a request for comment.  kushner’s attorney, jamie gorelick, said kushner did not remember any calls with kislyak between april and november.  “mr kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. he has no recollection of the calls as described. we have asked (reuters) for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information,” she said. in march, the white house said that kushner and flynn had met kislyak at trump tower in december to establish “a line of communication.” kislyak also attended a trump campaign speech in washington in april 2016 that kushner attended. the white house did not acknowledge any other contacts between kushner and russian officials. before the election, kislyak’s undisclosed discussions with kushner and flynn focused on fighting terrorism and improving u.s. russian economic relations, six of the sources said. former president barack obama imposed sanctions on russia after it seized crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern ukraine in 2014. after the nov. 8 election, kushner and flynn also discussed with kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between trump and russian president vladimir putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies, two of the sources said. reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place. reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between flynn and kislyak as trump prepared to take office. the washington post was first to report on friday that kushner participated in that conversation. separately, there were at least 18 undisclosed calls and emails between trump associates and kremlin linked people in the seven months before the nov. 8 presidential election, including six calls with kislyak, sources told reuters earlier this month. . two people familiar with those 18 contacts said flynn and kushner were among the trump associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone. reuters previously reported only flynn’s involvement in those discussions. six of the sources said there were multiple contacts between kushner and kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between april and november and the post election conversation about setting up a back channel. it is also not clear whether kushner engaged with kislyak on his own or with other trump aides.  fbi scrutiny of kushner began when intelligence reports of flynn’s contacts with russians included mentions of u.s. citizens, whose names were redacted because of u.s. privacy laws. this prompted investigators to ask u.s. intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the americans, the current u.s. law enforcement official said. kushner’s was one of the names that was revealed, the official said, prompting a closer look at the president’s son in law’s dealings with kislyak and other russians. fbi investigators are examining whether russians suggested to kushner or other trump aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow russian banks to offer financing to people with ties to trump, said the current u.s. law enforcement official.  the head of russian state owned vnesheconombank, sergei nikolaevich gorkov, a trained intelligence officer whom putin appointed, met kushner at trump tower in december. the bank is under u.s. sanctions and was implicated in a 2015 espionage case in which one of its new york executives pleaded guilty to spying and was jailed.  the bank said in a statement in march that it had met with kushner along with other representatives of u.s. banks and business as part of preparing a new corporate strategy. officials familiar with intelligence on contacts between the russians and trump advisers said that so far they have not seen evidence of any wrongdoing or collusion between the trump camp and the kremlin.  moreover, they said, nothing found so far indicates that trump authorized, or was even aware of, the contacts. there may not have been anything improper about the contacts, the current law enforcement official stressed. kushner offered in march to be interviewed by the senate intelligence committee, which is also investigating russia’s attempts to interfere in last year’s election. the contacts between trump campaign associates and russian officials during the presidential campaign coincided with what u.s. intelligence agencies concluded was a kremlin effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost trump’s chances of winning the white house and damage his democratic opponent, hillary clinton.

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday denied a report from nbc news that he told his national security advisers in july he wanted to increase the country s nuclear arsenal by nearly tenfold, saying he argued for its modernization. nbc news said the president called for the increase after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of u.s. nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. trump said he wanted to have that same number now, nbc reported. speaking to reporters at the white house during a meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau, trump said the report was not true.  i never discussed increasing it. i want it in perfect shape. that was just fake news by nbc,  he said.  we don t need an increase. but i want modernization and i want total rehabilitation. it s got to be in tip top shape.  the president s denial was buttressed by a statement from his defense chief.  recent reports that the president called for an increase in the u.s. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false.  this kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible,  defense secretary jim mattis said. although u.s. presidents have modernized weapon stockpiles over the years, any meaningful addition to the nuclear arsenal would violate treaty agreements. the federation of american scientists says the united states currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile. after the meeting in july, secretary of state rex tillerson referred to trump as a  moron,  according to nbc. u.s. news reports have painted the relationship between trump and tillerson as tense. the nbc report comes during a time of high tension between the united states and north korea over pyongyang s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and just ahead of an expected announcement from trump on whether to decertify the international deal on iran s nuclear program. trump told reuters in february that he wanted to ensure that the u.s. nuclear arsenal was at the  top of the pack.  msnbc reported in 2016 that as a candidate, trump asked a foreign policy adviser three times in a one hour meeting why the united states could not deploy its nuclear weapons.

" pope francis will meet the head of myanmar s army and rohingya refugees in bangladesh, both late additions to a tour of the two countries next week. human rights monitors and u.n. officials have accused myanmar s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless rohingya during operations that followed insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. vatican spokesman greg burke said on wednesday that the pope would meet army head senior general min aung hlaing on nov. 30 in a church residence in yangon. myanmar cardinal charles maung bo had talks with the pope in rome on saturday and suggested that he add a meeting with the general to the schedule for a trip that is proving to be one of the most politically sensitive since francis was elected in 2013. both the pope and the general agreed. some 600,000 rohingya refugees, most of them muslim and from myanmar s northern rakhine state, have fled to bangladesh. burke said a small group of rohingya refugees would be present at an inter religious meeting for peace in the bangladeshi capital, dhaka on dec 1. myanmar s government has denied most of the claims of atrocities against the rohingya, and the army last week said its own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. the pope will separately meet the country s leader, aung san suu kyi, in the capital naypyitaw, on nov. 28 in an encounter that was already on the schedule. briefing reporters on the trip, burke gave no details of how the rohingya who will meet the pope would be chosen. a source in dhaka said the refugees would be able to tell the pope about their experiences. both events were not on the original schedule of the nov. 26 dec. 2 trip. bo, the cardinal from myanmar, has advised the pope not to use the word rohingya while in myanmar because it is incendiary in the country where they are not recognized as an ethnic group. burke said the pope took the advice seriously but added:  we will find out together during the trip ... it is not a forbidden word .

" an israeli air strike targeted a factory south of the syrian city of homs on wednesday and the syrian army responded by firing a surface to air missile at the aircraft, a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of damascus said.   the commander told reuters the air strike had hit a copper factory in the industrial town of hisya, 35 km (21 miles) south of homs and 112 km (70 miles) north of damascus. the commander did not give details of any casualties. the syrian observatory for human rights, a britain based organization that reports on the war, said the air strike had targeted a military installation.     an israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment. israel s channel 10 said the aircraft were not hit and returned safely to base. the israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the syrian military and its lebanese ally, the iran backed hezbollah, nearly 100 times in recent years. israeli officials have expressed alarm at iranian influence in syria, where iran backed groups have played a critical role fighting in support of president bashar al assad during the conflict that erupted in 2011. iran s military chief general mohammad baqeri warned israel against breaching syrian airspace and territory during a visit to damascus last month. last month, five projectiles from syria set off air raid sirens in israeli towns, prompting the israeli military to say it would step up its response to stray fire from the syrian war that has repeatedly spilled over the border. the israeli air force attacked a syrian anti aircraft battery earlier that week that israel said had fired a missile at its planes while they were on a reconnaissance mission over neighboring lebanon. tensions between israel and hezbollah, which last fought a major conflict in 2006, have escalated this year. each side has warned it would unleash devastating firepower in the event of a full scale war.

" advisers to republican presidential nominee donald trump pledged to u.s. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on friday. eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with trump’s top agricultural advisers in washington on monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival democratic nominee hillary clinton in june. the presidential candidates’ agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net u.s. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. if that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. for trump’s team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against clinton for the nov. 8 election. he reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman paul manafort. agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included charles herbster, national chairman of trump’s agricultural advisory committee, and sam clovis, trump’s chief policy advisor, participants told reuters. former nebraska governor dave heineman, who is on trump’s advisory committee, also attended, they said. “there was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues,” said barb glenn, chief executive officer of the national association of state departments of agriculture.  also, there was a focus on “the concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government,” she said. clinton’s campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said jay vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association croplife america, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates. “both of them are quite interested in understanding where american ag is at,” he said. trump on tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six u.s. governors, a former u.s. department of agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the u.s. house and senate agriculture committees. the latest realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton 6 percentage points ahead of trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.

" north korea congratulated china on its 19th communist party congress on wednesday amid increasingly frayed relationships between the traditional allies, as china tightens sanctions over pyongyang s nuclear weapons program. the central committee of the north s ruling workers  party of korea said that china had made  great progress in accomplishing the cause of building socialism with chinese characteristics  under the correct guidance of the communist party.  we are greatly pleased over this,  the party central committee said in the message carried by the official kcna news agency, adding that it  sincerely wished  the china congress  satisfactory success . chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said that many foreign political parties, organizations and dignitaries had sent their congratulations, including the workers  party of korea.   this all shows that the international community is paying close attention to the 19th party congress. we express our thanks for this,  lu told a daily news briefing. officials and experts in south korea had worried that pyongyang may conduct a weapons test to coincide with the opening of the twice a decade congress in beijing, but there was no sign of that as chinese president xi jinping gave his opening speech. while the united states and its allies, and many people in china, believe beijing should do more to rein in pyongyang, the acceleration of north korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near total breakdown of high level diplomacy between the two. china, pyongyang s sole major ally and which accounts for more than 90 percent of world trade with the isolated country, has said it will strictly enforce u.n. security council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the north.

" the european union s chief brexit negotiator told german industry on wednesday that it was his responsibility to help european companies weather the exit of britain from the eu, and he warned britain that its economy had much to lose. in a series of speeches, michel barnier also said work remained to be done on how much britain would pay the eu to cover its share of the eu budget after it leaves. british newspapers have reported his team has broadly agreed on a payment of around 50 billion euros ( 44 billion). the eu has given britain until monday to make an acceptable offer for a financial settlement, agree on the rights of eu citizens in britain and ensure no hard border is set up with ireland. only then will it start talks on a future trade pact.  german business is worried about the impact of brexit     britain is germany s third largest export destination and its fifth biggest overall trading partner.   the future of the eu is more important than brexit,  barnier told the bda employers association and the bdi industry group and dihk chambers of commerce. barnier said he wasn t sure if the  whole truth  had been explained to british business on the impact of brexit.  my responsibility before you and everywhere in europe is to tell the truth to european businesses,  he said in the speech to the bda employers association. a trading relationship with a non eu member inevitably involved friction, he said.  whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, there will be no business as usual,  he said. some politicians in britain have argued that german companies depend on them for business, so berlin under chancellor angela merkel may help london get a deal. but only about 6 percent of germany s trade in goods is with the united kingdom, compared with 56 percent with the other eu countries, barnier said   making it clear britain had the most to lose. barnier also pointed to value added tax returns and the imports of animals and animal projects that are subject to checks at the eu s borders as potential problems. and he warned there was no guarantee that judgements by uk courts on trade disputes would automatically be recognised across the eu after brexit. the bdi industry association and dihk chambers of commerce stressed that the onus was on the british government to shift in its negotiations.  the british government must move so that the eu can give the green light in two weeks for phase two of the talks,  said the bdi and dihk groups.  there can be no cherry picking for london. it is clear: our priority is to strengthen the eu and develop it further,  they said, stressing that the freedoms of the internal market would not be diluted for britain during any transition phase. barnier also warned that companies should prepare for a possible  no deal , which implies returning to trade tariffs under world trade organisation rules, and border controls. that scenario would lead to higher transport and storage costs, hitting companies operating on a just in time basis, he said.  the no deal scenario is not our scenario, but since it cannot be ruled out, we have to prepare for it,  he said.

" the u.s. house of representatives on thursday passed a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most government activities in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1, knowing the senate will disagree with many controversial elements and force a negotiation that could stretch into december. the bill, passed by a 211 198 vote largely along party lines in the republican controlled house, provides $658.1 billion for the department of defense and $44.3 billion for the department of homeland security, including roughly $1.6 billion for construction of physical barriers along the u.s. mexican border. the $31.4 billion allotted for the department of the interior, the environmental protection agency (epa), the forest service, the indian health service and related agencies cut the epa’s funding by $534 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. the funding measure also included a provision that would stop the internal revenue service from implementing a provision of the 2010 affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, that imposes a tax penalty on individuals who elect to go without health insurance. representative kevin mccarthy, a member of republican leadership, said the funding measure would make “major changes to the way washington spends taxpayer dollars.” “our funding legislation forces the government to do what it ought to do and to stop doing what it shouldn’t do,” mccarthy said in a statement, praising it for “strengthening our national defense, veterans’ programs, and border security,” and “cutting abusive washington agencies like the irs and the epa.” democrats warned that the bill, which bundled together 12 separate funding measures and earned just one democratic vote, would need substantial revision in the senate, where republicans hold 52 of 100 seats but most legislation requires 60 votes for passage. “these bills cannot be enacted into law because they cannot gain democratic votes,” democratic representative nita lowey said in a statement, calling the house passed bill “inadequate and partisan.”   ",0
" the u.s. congress should consider overhauling its system of benefits for disabled people in puerto rico, who get almost no government help, according to a new report by a task force addressing the island’s economic crisis. the report, released tuesday, cited a december 9 reuters investigation that detailed the scant support for island residents with severe mental and physical problems.  most get nothing. those who do get benefits receive an average of $74 a month   about a tenth of what the u.s. gives the disabled in its 50 states. reuters also revealed wide disparities in support among u.s. territories.  read the special report here: reut.rs/2hg0vdr sen. orrin hatch   a republican from utah who heads the bipartisan congressional task force on economic growth in puerto rico   did not immediately respond to requests for comment wednesday. the task force recommended that congress consider providing puerto rico and other u.s. territories the same supplemental security income (ssi) benefits it grants to the states.  four of five u.s. territories   puerto rico, guam, american samoa and the u.s. virgin islands   have been excluded from ssi since the program launched in the 1970s. the fifth territory, the northern mariana islands, gets the same ssi benefits as a state, with an average payment of $560 monthly, in part because it negotiated its territory status at about the same time congress enacted the ssi program.  disabled puerto ricans, by contrast, receive much less through a nearly forgotten program administered by the administration of children and families (acf), a division of the u.s. department of health and human services. nearly half of puerto rico’s disabled residents live in poverty   twice the rate of those in the 50 states. the disabled in guam receive an average of $164, and in the virgin islands, $176. disabled people in american samoa get nothing.  ssi offers disabled residents of u.s. states up to $733 each month and pays an average of $540. as an alternative to giving the territories ssi benefits, the task force suggested congress could increase benefits through acf. federal funding for the program has been capped since 1996 and is not indexed for inflation. the panel also recommended that acf publicly release up to date information about the benefits paid to disabled citizens of u.s. territories. when reuters first requested comment on benefits for the disabled in puerto rico, acf declined to make anyone available because “no one is completely versed in all the details,” said spokesman pat fisher.  on wednesday, fisher declined to comment on the task force recommendations. “we cannot offer an opinion on proposed policy,” he said. “we only carry out approved policy.” a 2014 study by the government accountability office, the investigative arm of congress, found that if puerto rico received ssi, eligibility would expand ten fold from nearly 34,500 in 2011 to 354,000 people. the federal government’s payments to the island would skyrocket from $24 million to as much as $1.8 billion annually.  the task force also made recommendations about how to improve health care in puerto rico, which the group described as “a serious and urgent issue.” for decades, the u.s. offered lower payments to puerto rico under the federally sponsored medicare and medicaid insurance programs, which cover most people on the island. the medicaid insurance program for the poor, for example, has had its funding capped by washington for decades, spurring island officials to borrow heavily through municipal bonds.  that contributed to what is now the largest municipal debt crisis in u.s. history. an estimated one third of puerto rico’s $70 billion of outstanding debt stems from bonds issued to shore up healthcare funding. reuters reported in october that puerto rico’s physicians are fleeing the island’s financially strapped healthcare system for high paying and more stable jobs in the 50 states. the resulting shortage of doctors has exacerbated waits for appointments on the island to longer than 18 months in some specialties. read the special report here: reut.rs/2e4t00o the most cited reason for giving puerto rico unequal treatment in medicaid and other programs is because puerto ricans do not pay federal income taxes. some members of the task force believe that may warrant lower allocations for social welfare on the island, according to the report. other members disagreed.  all members, however, agreed “more equitable treatment should still be considered,” according to the report. that would reduce the incentive for puerto rico residents to migrate to u.s. states, as they have in large numbers for decades, leaving behind a more vulnerable population. the panel urged congress to begin addressing the funding issues early next year, and suggested federal funding of the island’s medicaid program be “more closely tied to the size and needs of the territory’s low income population.” ",0
" republican leaders are aiming to send their tax bill to president donald trump for his signature by the end of the year. to do that, negotiators from the u.s. house of representatives and the senate will need to iron out differences between their two versions of the legislation. here are some of the main points they will need to address. the senate bill repeals a provision of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, that levies a penalty on taxpayers who do not purchase health insurance. the house bill did not repeal the mandate’s penalty but leaders there have indicated they would be open to doing so it if the senate could pass it. the house bill consolidates seven individual income tax rates into four but keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. the senate version keeps seven brackets and sets the top rate at 38.5 percent.  pass through businesses the house legislation capped at 25 percent the tax rate on 30 percent of pass through business income, with the remaining 70 percent taxed at individual wage rates. the house excluded taxpayers in professional services, who would continue paying individual tax rates on all income. the senate bill leaves all pass through income in the individual system but establishes a deduction for 23 percent of pass through income. the senate version allows those in services professions to use the deduction if their income is less than $250,000 per year, or $500,000 for a married couple. pass through businesses include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations, encompassing most american business enterprises from mom and pop concerns to large financial and real estate organizations. the house bill repeals the deduction for medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of a taxpayer’s annual income. the senate version retains the deduction for two years and drops the threshold to 7.5 percent of income. the house bill repeals the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes, or amt, which are intended to make sure high income taxpayers do not unduly lower their tax liabilities by combining numerous credits and deductions. the senate bill repeals the individual amt but keeps the 20 percent corporate amt. by also cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, some corporations have said this means they would not be able to use popular tax breaks such as the research and development credit. the house bill limited a popular individual tax deduction to interest on home mortgages of $500,000 or less. the senate bill would allow taxpayers to deduct interest on mortgages of $1,000,000 or less. the house bill would allow companies to fully deduct the value of machinery and equipment and other costs for five years. the senate bill allows businesses to do the same but then phases it out over five years.

" republicans in the u.s. congress reached a deal on tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to president donald trump to sign into law. formal language of the legislation, expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over a decade, has not been released. the following are known provisions on which house of representatives and senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: corporate tax rate: falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. the house and senate bills, as well as trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to allow the tax cut to take effect immediately. u.s. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  pass through businesses: creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. the house had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the senate, a 23 percent deduction.  corporate minimum: repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. clean energy: maintains production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. the house had proposed repealing the electric vehicle credit and scaling back the wind energy credit. the senate version did neither. individual income tax rates: there will be seven brackets, and the top rate falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. the house had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. the senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining seven brackets. permanence: the expectation is that individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years, possibly after 2024. the individual tax rates in the house bill were to be permanent. the individual tax rates in the senate bill were to expire after 2025. state and local tax (salt): both the house and senate had proposed scaling back the popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property tax payments and capping that at $10,000. the compromise bill will keep that $10,000 cap, but allow for continued deduction of both state and local income tax payments, as well as property tax payments. mortgage interest: caps the mortgage interest deduction for new mortgages at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. the house had proposed a $500,000 cap. the senate bill left it at $1 million. estate tax: roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million per person, or about $22 million per couple, but leaves the estate tax in place, mirroring the senate proposal. the house bill had proposed entirely repealing the estate tax over several years. obamacare mandate: repeals a federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. the house bill did not repeal the obamacare individual mandate.  anwr drilling: allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge. the provision was sponsored by republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska.

" iran s defense capabilities are not negotiable, supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said wednesday in remarks made previously but which now come amid increased pressure from the u.s. government over tehran s ballistic missile program. ties between iran and the united states have deteriorated under u.s. president donald trump and suffered another deep blow two weeks ago when he decided not to certify that tehran is complying with a 2015 nuclear pact and warning he might ultimately terminate it. iran has reacted defiantly, dismissing trump s demands for the pact to be toughened up. last week, iran s elite revolutionary guards, the most powerful military force in the country, said its ballistic missile program would accelerate despite u.s. and european union pressure to suspend it.  the defense capabilities and strength of the country are not negotiable or up for haggling,  khamenei was cited as saying at a ceremony at the imam ali army officer s academy in tehran, according to state media. the ramping up of rhetoric on both sides has raised the specter of a possible military confrontation between the two countries. in recent months, small boats from the revolutionary guards navy have swarmed close to american warships in the gulf, prompting the u.s. navy to fire flares and warning shots. under the landmark 2015 deal between iran and world powers, the islamic republic agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions. the u.s. senate is considering new legislation which could lead to washington restoring sanctions on iran should it test a ballistic missile able to carry a warhead or bar nuclear inspectors from any sites. in response, khamenei said last week that tehran would stick to the nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if washington pulled out.

" france s air accident investigation agency said on tuesday it would lead the probe into an engine explosion that prompted the emergency landing of an air france a380 superjumbo in canada with over 500 people on board on saturday. reuters reported on monday that canada, france and the united states were debating who should lead the investigation into the accident, which took place high over greenland. the decision to hand control to the bea means investigators can begin planning an unusual search in potentially inhospitable terrain to find a missing 3 metre (9.8 foot) wide fan that ripped off the engine in midair. nobody was injured in the incident, in which air france flight 66, originating in paris and bound for los angeles, declared a mayday and diverted to goose bay in labrador. the bea confirmed that the engine s main fan and inlet had become detached. it now plans with danish help to search for the missing parts.  that s what is envisaged, but it depends on snow conditions,  a bea spokesman said. a preliminary reading of the plane s data recorder in canada has identified a search area. the bea said damage was limited to the right outer no.4 engine and its immediate surroundings, boosting chances that the aircraft can be flown back to europe for further examination. the a380 is the world s largest airliner and a european icon with a history of attracting debate because of its high public profile, and the start of the probe appeared to be no exception. under aviation law, the job of investigating belongs to denmark since the blowout happened over greenland, which is part of denmark with self government over domestic affairs. with three other major aviation nations involved, each equipped with sophisticated testing equipment, denmark exercised its right to delegate the main role. but people briefed on the talks said it took days to agree who should take its place. canada was seen as keen to keep control of the case, but aviation experts said france had priority because that was where the plane was built, designed, registered and operated. canadian investigators will remain involved along with counterparts from the united states, france and denmark, whose expertise is needed to track down the missing fan. they will be helped by airbus and u.s. engine maker engine alliance, co owned by general electric and pratt & whitney. experts say such engine accidents are rare but must be investigated thoroughly because of the significant damage they can cause. in 2010, a qantas a380 made an emergency landing in singapore after a rolls royce engine exploded shortly after take off. investigators blamed a badly manufactured part.

" a top republican in congress on wednesday defended his border adjustable tax provision against criticism from president elect donald trump, warning that u.s. jobs and companies will continue to move abroad unless the controversial measure is included in tax reform. representative kevin brady, chairman of the house of representatives tax writing committee that produced the proposal, said the reform measure to tax imports but not exports remains part of the discussions between republican lawmakers and trump’s presidential transition team. “i’m absolutely confident that we can move this provision forward,” brady said in an interview with cnbc. “without it, america will continue to have incentives for jobs and manufacturing to leave the country. none of us want that.” brady, who already faces mounting criticism from import dependent industries that oppose the measure, was speaking a day after the wall street journal published a trump interview in which the republican president elect unexpectedly branded border adjustment as “too complicated.” “anytime i hear border adjustment, i don’t love it,” trump told the newspaper. “because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal.” trump’s comments surprised business lobbyists who believed he would support the provision as a way to increase the number of u.s. blue collar jobs. in response, goldman sachs lowered from 30 percent to 20 percent its “subjective probability” that border adjustment would be adopted as part of a tax reform legislative package. trump appeared to step back from his criticism in an interview published on wednesday on the news website axios, saying border adjustability was still on the table.    without border adjustment, lawmakers could have to scale back the house republican “better way” tax reform blueprint. the measure would raise more than $1 trillion in revenues over 10 years, according to independent analysts. its loss would limit the size of tax cuts and jeopardize a related provision to end taxation on the foreign profits of u.s. corporations. advocates say border adjustment would encourage companies to establish manufacturing plants on american soil, because it would make u.s. export sales tax exempt while preventing companies from deducting the cost of imports from their taxable income. but a top trump lieutenant failed to name border adjustment as a way to entice foreign companies to the united states during a senate confirmation hearing. wilbur ross, trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said instead that lowering the corporate tax rate is “probably the biggest single tool that we could use.” ",0

" hamas freed five prisoners belonging to the rival fatah party on sunday and egypt sent a delegation to the gaza strip to oversee the islamist group s planned handover of administrative control of the palestinian enclave to a unity government. the west bank based palestinian prime minister, rami al hamdallah, and other officials of the government formed in 2014 are due in gaza on monday to run ministries and hold a cabinet meeting the next day. hamas opted for reconciliation with western backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas s fatah because it is short of funds and friends a decade after seizing the enclave in a brief civil war. [nl8n1ma2ft]  we are determined to ... bury the chapter of division so that the homeland can be reunited,  hamdallah said in public remarks in the west bank city of ramallah. one cabinet member, culture minister ehab bseisso, arrived in gaza on sunday and held a meeting with deputies and employees after taking up his post. hamas made its dramatic turn towards reconciliation on sept. 17 after egypt, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates imposed an economic boycott on the movement s main donor, qatar, over alleged support of terrorists. abbas, whose popularity ratings are low, has been facing public pressure to patch up differences with hamas. hamas s armed wing still remains the dominant power in the territory of 2 million people partially blockaded by israel and egypt, which cite security concerns for border restrictions. on the eve of the handover, hamas released five fatah security men it jailed two years ago for what an interior ministry spokesman described as  actions harmful to internal security . their sentences ranged from seven to 15 years. speaking to reporters, one of the freed inmates, taher abu armana, thanked hamas gaza chief yehya al sinwar and mohammed dahlan, a former fatah security chief in the enclave, for his release. dahlan, based since 2011 in the united arab emirates, is behind an influx of cash to prop up gaza and detente between hamas and arab states including egypt, which hosted reconciliation talks.   we urge president (mahmoud abbas) to order the release of all political prisoners in the west bank,  abu armana said, a reference to members of hamas, a group considered by western countries that back abbas to be a terrorist organization. an official of the palestinian authority, the self rule body headed by abbas in the israeli occupied west bank, said an egyptian delegation comprised of two generals and cairo s ambassador to israel, arrived in gaza to oversee reconciliation efforts. it was the first official egyptian delegation to travel to gaza since 2012. egypt suspended its diplomatic mission in gaza in 2007 after the hamas takeover.

" the kremlin on thursday condemned a pre election video in the united states promoting republican front runner donald trump at hillary clinton’s expense, complaining that it unfairly “demonized” russia. the kremlin did not spell out what its exact objection to the political attack video was. but its portrayal of president vladimir putin as one of washington’s toughest opponents alongside islamic state, a group the kremlin says it is fighting in syria, is likely to have stirred anger among officials.   “i saw this clip. i do not know for sure if vladimir putin saw it. (but) our attitude is negative,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a teleconference with reporters. the video tries to cast doubt over the ability of clinton, the democratic party’s likely presidential candidate, to contend with putin in the event of her winning the november election. presenting what it suggests are the united states’ toughest opponents, it shows putin throwing an opponent in a judo bout before cutting to footage of mohammed emwazi, the late islamic state executioner nicknamed “jihadi john”.    it then shifts to a clip of clinton which has been edited to make it appear as if she is barking like a dog. putin is then shown laughing. “it’s an open secret for us that demonizing russia and whatever is linked to russia is unfortunately a mandatory hallmark of america’s election campaign,” said peskov. “we always sincerely regret this and wish the (u.s.) electoral process were conducted without such references to our country.” until now, the kremlin has largely held off criticising trump. putin and trump have lavished praise on one another in the past after the republican front runner spoke out in favour of building bridges with the kremlin and of working together to fight terrorism. russian state tv, which usually closely reflects the kremlin’s world view, has also generally been more positive about trump than the other presidential candidates, suggesting his policies are more russia friendly. but state tv has at the same time complained about what it says is the anti russian tenor of the overall campaign, criticising most candidates for what it has described as their hysterical cold war style statements on russia. the united states has accused russia during its aerial bombing campaign in syria of not targeting islamic state targets with the same ferocity or frequency it has demonstrated against what washington says are more moderate groups opposed to president bashar al assad.   moscow, an ally of assad, has denied that charge, declaring islamic state a dangerous threat to its own national security.

" the obama administration proposed a rule on friday aimed at attracting thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs to start companies in the united states.  the rule, proposed by the department of homeland security, would ease the ability of startup founders to build companies if they have significant funding from u.s. investors. the administration hopes the rule will be completed before president barack obama’s term ends on jan. 20. the proposed rule is part of obama’s commitment to “attracting the world’s best and brightest entrepreneurs to start the next great companies here,” tom kalil, a technology policy adviser at the white house, told reporters in a call. kalil said immigrants have co founded as many as one in four high tech startups across the united states and more than half of all startups in silicon valley.  immigration has been a crucial issue in the 2016 presidential campaign ahead of the nov. 8 election. republican candidate donald trump has vowed to toughen immigration policies, while democratic candidate hillary clinton has proposed creating an office of immigrant affairs to expand obama’s efforts to help immigrants integrate better into the country.  under the rule, dhs would issue temporary permission for entrepreneurs to live in the united states if they have at least 15 percent ownership in startup companies formed in the country within the past three years. the companies must have investment of at least $345,000 from qualified u.s. investors. the administration expects about 3,000 immigrants would apply for the temporary permission, known as parole. max levchin, a co founder of paypal and other companies who was born in ukraine, said the proposed rule is a “great, concrete step toward creating more jobs in america and more success stories.” many entrepreneurs are educated at prestigious u.s. universities, but find themselves unable to stay in the country  because they lose visa lotteries or can’t afford to sponsor themselves through an existing investor visa program. “we lose and will continue to lose talented, skilled, well educated scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs because they are simply not allowed to stay and work after we educated them to very high standards,” levchin said. “it makes very little sense.” ",0

" the u.s. supreme court on monday will hear arguments in a challenge by 26 states to president barack obama’s executive action to defer deportation of certain immigrant children and parents who are in the country illegally. here is a chronology of the case, united states v. texas: june 15, 2012   the obama administration, through the department of homeland security, initiates the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which suspends deportation for two years for people who entered the country illegally at least five years earlier, before they were age 16, and who were under age 31 as of june 15, 2012. nov. 20, 2014   obama, through unilateral executive action, initiates a new deferred deportation and work authorization policy for immigrants whose children are u.s. citizens or lawful permanent residents and who have been living illegally in the united states since jan. 1, 2010. these people must pass certain background checks for possible past criminal convictions. the program is called deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents (dapa). the obama administration also expands the earlier daca program by eliminating the age 31 cap and increasing deferred deportation from two to three years. dec. 3, 2014   texas and other republican governed states sue the democratic obama administration in u.s. district court in texas. they assert that obama’s nov. 20 executive actions, which bypassed the republican led congress, violated the administrative procedure act (apa) notice and comment requirements for new federal agency rules and violated the u.s. constitution’s dictate that a president “take care” that laws are “faithfully executed.” in all, 26 of the 50 u.s. states eventually sign on to the lawsuit: alabama, arizona, arkansas, florida, georgia, idaho, indiana, kansas, louisiana, maine, michigan, mississippi, montana, nebraska, nevada, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah, west virginia and wisconsin. feb. 16, 2015   u.s. district court judge andrew hanen in the border city of brownsville, texas issues an injunction blocking enforcement of the programs nationwide. the judge says the obama administration had failed to offer notice and seek comments under the administrative procedure act. administration lawyers counter that the actions did not arise from official rule making but rather from homeland security department discretion on deportation priorities. may 26, 2015   after the administration appeals the judge’s decision, the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, based in new orleans, upholds hanen’s injunction, pending an appeal on the merits of the case. nov. 9, 2015   the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit rules for texas and the other states, throwing out obama’s dapa and expanded daca actions because, the court says, they were subject to notice and comment requirements under the administrative procedure act. jan. 19, 2016   the supreme court agrees to hear the  administration’s appeal. the justices say they will review the administrative procedure act issue as well as whether the program violates the “take care” mandate. a key question before the justices is whether texas and the other states even have legal standing to bring the case based on a claim that obama’s action would cost the states financially in certain public services such as the cost of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. feb. 13, 2016   justice antonin scalia dies, leaving the supreme court with only eight members   four liberals and four conservatives   and the possibility of a 4 4 deadlock. such a split ruling would be a defeat for obama because it would leave in place the 5th circuit decision disallowing his executive action. april 18, 2016   oral arguments scheduled in united states v. texas. a ruling is expected by the end of june.

" lawyers for two new york residents seeking to throw ted cruz off next month’s presidential primary ballot in the state urged an appeals court panel on wednesday to consider whether the u.s. senator from texas is eligible given his canadian birth. the case put forward by new york residents barry korman, 81, of manhattan and william gallo, 85, of manhasset, had been dismissed by a supreme court judge earlier this month because it was filed after a procedural deadline. lawyers roger bernstein and judith hancock urged the five judges of the appellate division of new york to consider the merits of their case to block cruz from the april 19 new york state primary election. the objectors attached cruz’s birth certificate showing he was born in december 1970 in calgary, alberta. bernstein told the panel the primary ballot must only contain constitutionally eligible presidential candidates, and argued the appeals judges should give greater weight to the importance of the issue than the missed deadline. their petition to block cruz came 19 days beyond the three day limit after a candidate files a request to be placed on the ballot, cruz’s lawyers said, adding that the objection should not go forward because it was tardy. the appeals judges are expected to rule later this week. the case is one of several similar challenges to cruz’s eligibility to run for the white house   including lawsuits in alabama, illinois, pennsylvania and texas   filed since republican front runner donald trump brought up questions about whether cruz meets the constitutional requirement to be president. the constitution says that to be president, a person must be a “natural born citizen” of the united states. cruz has argued that he is eligible to run because of his mother’s u.s. citizenship, and many legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the united states would block his presidential bid. the lawyers representing the new york objectors are also representing the appeal of carmon elliott, who is complaining about cruz being on the ballot in pennsylvania.

" a portuguese court has handed long prison sentences to six members of a bogus religious cult that sexually abused boys, including their own children, under the pretence of rituals on a farm just southeast of lisbon. tuesday s verdict by the setubal district court sentenced rui pedro, the 36 year old leader of the self proclaimed celestial truth sect, to 23 years after finding him guilty of rape, procuring prostitution, child pornography and other crimes, a court official said on wednesday.  his wife and four other men were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 and 19 years. two women were acquitted. the crimes were committed between 2011 and 2015, mostly on a farm rented by the group in 2014. prosecutors told the court that the cult was fake, and its rituals set up as a means to lure and scare the children. the eight victims, including the leader s son and the son of another of the sentenced men, had been told that the sect s  master  had supernatural powers and could perform  acts of purification  on them, which was the term for sexual abuse. the boys, aged between 5 and 16 at the time of the crimes and mostly from the setubal area, were kept in fear of his powers so they never disclosed what happened to anyone.  their families had been led to believe the children played football or studied and received psychological counselling or religious guidance on the farm. police arrested the group in 2015 after one of the members, andre marques, reported them to the authorities. he was still sentenced to 19 years, as the court ruled that he had only cooperated  to save his own skin , daily newspaper publico reported.

" north dakota governor doug burgum, who took office last month in the height of tensions surrounding the dakota access pipeline, said he believed the line would eventually be built and asked opponents to clean their protest camp before spring floodwaters create a potential ecological disaster.  a centrist republican with no prior political experience, burgum was elected in a landslide on a platform of streamlining government and improving relations across the state. burgum built a successful software business before selling it to microsoft corp (msft.o) in 2001. burgum told reuters that approval of the pipeline appeared to be a foregone conclusion once donald trump moved into the white house. “i expect the world’s going to change dramatically on that day relative to finding resolution on this issue,” burgum said in an interview. “i would expect that (energy transfer partners (etp.n)) will get its easement and it will go through.”      a coalition of native american groups, environmentalists, hollywood stars and veterans of the u.s. armed forces protested the $3.8 billion oil project at a north dakota camp, which at one point held more than 5,000, though that number has shrunk in size during the winter.  opponents contend construction would damage sacred lands and any leaks could pollute the water supply of the standing rock sioux tribe. last month, president barack obama denied a key permit needed to complete the pipeline, but trump has said he will review that decision. local law enforcement have voiced concerns that any reversal by the federal government could cause the area to swell again with protesters, straining resources.  david archambault, chairman of the standing rock sioux tribe, has repeatedly asked protesters to leave the area and let the pipeline fight play out in courts. burgum said he agrees with archambault and asked protesters to help clean up the camp before it threatens the environment itself. more than 300 vehicles, along with dozens of temporary dwellings and other detritus, have been abandoned at the campsite, which sits in a flood plain that is likely to be overrun by spring rain and snowmelt. state officials are concerned that floodwaters could carry that material away. “the amount of cleanup that needs to take place is enormous,” burgum said. “we’ve got a potential ecological disaster if this land floods and all the debris flows downstream into tribal lands.” ",0
" hackers believed to be working for the russian government broke into the democratic national committee’s computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, the committee and security experts said on tuesday. two separate groups entered the dnc’s system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and crowdstrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. russian spies also targeted the networks of trump and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, as well as the computers of some republican political action committees, the washington post quoted u.s. officials as saying, although details were not available. a clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaign’s information systems had been hacked. a russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. “i completely rule out a possibility that the (russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,” dmitry peskov, a kremlin spokesman, told reuters in moscow. the intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of u.s. adversaries in cyberspace. the democratic party had been aware of efforts to hack trump material for two months, and u.s. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with trump opposition research said. the source said democratic party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the russian government. the research includes material on trump’s business efforts in azerbaijan, georgia, serbia and russia, according to information made available to reuters.         cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. u.s. national intelligence director james clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the nov. 8 presidential election nears. u.s. representative jim langevin, a democrat and co founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was “disconcerting” that independent groups penetrated the dnc and that one was able “to stay embedded for nearly a year.” but the groups are extremely sophisticated, langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the white house, the state department and the german bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. the dnc contacted crowdstrike in may and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the group’s network, said dmitri alperovitch, the company’s co founder and chief technology officer. it identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. the first, which crowdstrike named cozy bear, entered the dnc’s systems last summer, according to the firm. it primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for russia’s federal security service, or fsb, alperovitch said.  russian president vladimir putin once ran the fsb. the second group, nicknamed fancy bear, is probably working on behalf of russia’s military, alperovitch said. it gained entry in late april and “went straight to the oppo research ... on donald trump and exfiltrated some of it,” he said. alperovitch said both groups were among “the best threat actors that we’ve ever encountered” but they did not appear to be working together. he was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged “spearphishing” emails to trick dnc employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. “when we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,” rep. debbie wasserman schultz, chairwoman of the dnc, said in a statement. “our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.” trump’s interest in russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 vanity fair article citing news program appearances in which trump offered his own services as a negotiator with russia.  information made available to reuters indicates trump tried on at least three occasions   in 2004, 2008 and 2013   to get involved in business deals in russia. in 2013, he and an azerbaijani russian oligarch, aras agalarov, jointly put on a miss universe competition in moscow, and trump was photographed with agalarov’s wife, son and daughter. the last two u.s. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting president barack obama’s campaign and the campaigns of his republican foes. u.s. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to chinese hackers.

" mitch mcconnell, the u.s. senate’s top republican, clung to slim hopes on tuesday that his party could still dismantle obamacare, despite not having adequate support for a repeal bill. facing the possibility of another failure to make good on their 7 year old pledge to roll back the healthcare law, mcconnell told senators the debate on healthcare would continue. he said nothing about whether he would bring the repeal bill to a vote, leaving open the option of letting the measure simply die if more firm votes for it cannot be nailed down. republicans have vowed for years to get rid of the 2010 affordable care act, or obamacare, but they are up against a sept. 30 deadline to pass a bill with a simple majority, or face a much tougher path toward dismantling it. senator susan collins rebuffed intense lobbying from fellow republicans and the promise of money for her state when she decided on monday to oppose   and likely doom   the latest effort to repeal obamacare. it was a blow for president donald trump who has made undoing democratic former president barack obama’s signature healthcare law a top priority since the 2016 campaign and who pressured collins in a call on monday. republicans hold a slim 52 48 majority in the senate and  at least two other republican senators, john mccain and rand paul, have already rejected the bill. no votes from mccain, collins and another republican, lisa murkowski, killed an effort by the senate to undo obamacare in july. while obamacare extended health insurance to some 20 million americans, many republicans believe it is an unwarranted and costly government intrusion into healthcare, while also opposing taxes it imposed on the wealthy. mcconnell opened the senate on tuesday by praising the measure, which is sponsored by republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy. he said it contrasted sharply with democratic proposals for “single payer” healthcare. “it’s an important debate for our country,” mcconnell said. “it’s one that will certainly continue.” the graham cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help americans buy private insurance, and divvy it up to the states in block grants. one main complaint by opponents of the bill is that it would mean sweeping cuts in funding to medicaid.

" united nations secretary general antonio guterres appealed on tuesday for statesmanship to avoid war with north korea and criticized world leaders who stoke resentment over refugees for political gain, two digs at u.s. president donald trump. in his first address to the annual 193 member u.n. general assembly since taking office in january, guterres said the crisis over north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile program must be solved through a political process.   this is the time for statesmanship,  said the former prime minister of portugal.  we must not sleepwalk our way into war.   trump has warned north korea that military action was an option for the united states as pyongyang has carried out a series of tests toward developing the ability to target the united states with a nuclear tipped missile. the u.n. security council has unanimously imposed nine  rounds of sanctions on north korea since 2006 and guterres appealed for the 15 member body to maintain its unity on north korea. guterres, a former head of the u.n. refugee agency, also spoke of being  pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated   and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain.  shortly after taking office in january, trump moved to put a 120 day halt on the u.s. refugee program, bar syrian refugees indefinitely and impose a 90 day suspension on people from six predominantly muslim countries. he says the move is needed to prevent terrorist attacks.   i myself am a migrant, as many of you are. but no one expected me to risk my life on a leaky boat or cross a desert in the back of a truck to find employment outside my country of birth,  he said.  safe migration cannot be limited to the global elite.   guterres also warned of the dangers of climate change and urged world leaders to implement the 2015 paris climate agreement to reduce emissions  with ever greater ambition.   trump, who campaigned in the 2016 presidential election on an  america first  platform, has said the united states would withdraw from the accord. trump said it would harm u.s. industries, cost u.s. jobs, weaken american national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other nations.  it is high time to get off the path of suicidal emissions. we know enough today to act. the science is unassailable,  guterres said. on counterterrorism, guterres said he plans to convene next year the first gathering of heads of counterterrorism agencies of u.n. member states to forge a new international counterterrorism partnership.

" members of the u.s. congress from both parties on friday backed president donald trump’s cruise missile strikes on syria, but demanded he develop a strategy for dealing with the broader conflict and consult with congress on any further action. in the biggest foreign policy decision of his presidency, trump ordered the firing of cruise missiles at a syrian air base that u.s. officials said was the launching point for a deadly chemical weapons attack against syrian civilians this week. “the strike was well planned, well executed. it was certainly more than a pinprick, and sends a message ... that using chemical weapons again is not something (syrian president bashar al assad) can do with impunity,” republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told a news conference. mcconnell said vice president mike pence had called him to explain the rationale for the strikes. it was one of a series of calls by administration officials to members of congress beginning shortly before the strikes and extending until after midnight on thursday evening. senator bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, was called by attorney general jeff sessions, secretary of state rex tillerson and trump himself. after seeing the devastation in syria and visiting refugee camps, he said he became emotional when he heard the news. “when i talked to the president last night, i told him how proud i was of our country. and him,” corker said. democratic senator mark warner, vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee, said trump’s director of national intelligence, dan coats, had called. “i am hopeful these strikes will convince the assad regime that such actions should never be repeated,” warner said in a statement. partisan debate over how to deal with syria has been bitter. in 2013, then president barack obama ran into stiff resistance from many republicans, including mcconnell, when he proposed military action to retaliate for a chemical attack that crossed obama’s red line. many democrats, some of whom had paid a political penalty for backing republican president george w. bush’s war in iraq, also opposed intervention. obama’s abrupt decision not to fire missiles and instead work with russia to remove assad’s chemical weapons infuriated many republicans who had backed the democratic president’s proposal. the conflict in syria has now dragged on for seven years, devastating the country, destabilizing the region and leaving millions homeless. republican senator marco rubio said he wanted a broader strategy. “i would love to have one yesterday, or the day before. i’d like to have one already but i’d rather them design it correctly than not,” he said, leaving a briefing by general joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. most lawmakers insisted trump should seek congress’ approval for any additional military action. “congress must live up to its constitutional responsibility to debate an authorization of the use of military force against a sovereign nation,” democratic leader nancy pelosi wrote in a letter asking speaker paul ryan to call the house of representatives back to washington to debate a formal authorization to use military force. the house is not due to return until late april. republican senator rand paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, called the syria strikes illegal. under the u.s. constitution, declarations of war require congressional approval. “we’ve had no chance to weigh or weigh in on whether we should do it or not,” paul told reporters. democratic senator chris murphy, another committee member, said that if congress does not assert itself now, it risked losing its constitutional right to declare war. “i think it’s devastating to the future role of congress in foreign affairs. if we don’t authorize this action, i don’t see why any president would ever come to congress,” murphy said.

" france s foreign minister said on thursday he would head to libya  very soon  to push warring parties to support a peace roadmap tentatively agreed in paris in july.  libyan prime minister fayez al serraj and the divided country s eastern commander khalifa haftar verbally committed last month to a conditional ceasefire and to work toward holding elections next spring.  i will be traveling to libya very soon to ensure the follow up of this meeting and to get the support of all sides to the declaration that was adopted then,  jean yves le drian said in a speech to french ambassadors. france, which took a leading role in the nato air campaign that helped rebels topple muammar gaddafi, has sought to play a greater role in libya, believing diplomatic efforts were stalling and that under president emmanuel macron it could fill that void. officials fear jihadist groups could try to exploit the power vacuum in libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in syria and iraq, and see a resolution to the conflict as vital to ending europe s migrant crisis.  in libya, france along with others has a specific responsibility to help this country find unity and stability,  le drian said. past attempts at peace deals in oil producing libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the myriad of competing armed groups that have emerged since rebels toppled  gaddafi in 2011.  diplomats declined to say specifically when le drian was traveling due to security reasons.   the french initiative has angered officials in italy, which has previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former north african colony and borne the brunt of successive waves of african migrants who have crossed the mediterranean from libya.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on friday will propose a $10 billion investment in partnerships to encourage the growth of the u.s. manufacturing sector as part of a national push to discourage outsourcing in the industry. the proposal would work with a broader campaign to encourage companies to build and expand their u.s. manufacturing operations. clinton is slated to roll out the proposal on friday in syracuse, new york, ahead of the state’s nominating contest on april 19. new york has long been a hub of the manufacturing industry, but suffered significant declines in the sector in recent years. from 2000 2008, upstate new york alone lost nearly 105,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the state government. clinton maintains a lead in the state, which she represented in the u.s. senate, over rival bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont and a new york native.  sanders was born and raised in new york city’s borough of brooklyn. the clinton campaign is headquartered there.  the campaign said the proposal’s multi billion dollar price tag would largely be covered by clinton’s proposed “clawback” tax, which would rescind tax relief for companies that outsource jobs or facilities abroad.

" saudi arabia plans to extract uranium domestically as part of its nuclear power program and sees this as a step towards  self sufficiency  in producing atomic fuel, a senior official said on monday. extracting its own uranium also makes sense from an economic point of view, said hashim bin abdullah yamani, head of the saudi government agency tasked with the nuclear plans, the king abdullah city for atomic and renewable energy (kacare). in a speech at an international nuclear power conference in abu dhabi, he did not specify whether saudi arabia seeks to also enrich and reprocess uranium   steps in the fuel cycle which are especially sensitive as they can open up the possibility of military uses of the material. the world s top oil exporter says it wants to tap atomic power for peaceful purposes only in order to diversify its energy supply and will award a construction contract for its first two nuclear reactors by the end of 2018.  regarding the production of uranium in the kingdom, this is a program which is our first step towards self sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel,  yamani told a conference organized by the international atomic energy agency (iaea).  we utilize the uranium ore that has been proven to be economically efficient.  atomic reactors need uranium enriched to around 5 percent purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to higher, weapons grade levels. this issue has been at the heart of western and regional concerns about the nuclear work of iran, saudi arabia s foe, and led to the 2015 deal in which iran agreed to freeze the program for 15 years for sanctions relief. on monday, iaea chief yukiya amano said iran was complying with the nuclear deal signed with world powers and which u.s. president donald trump has called into question. under the agreement, iran can enrich uranium to 3.67 percent purity, around the normal level needed for commercial power generation. saudi arabia would be the second country in the gulf arab region to tap nuclear after the united arab emirates, which is set to start up its first, south korean built reactor in 2018. the uae has committed not to enrich uranium itself and not to reprocess spent fuel. industry sources have told reuters saudi arabia is reaching out to potential vendors from south korea, china, france, russia, japan and the united states for its first two reactors.  the plans have received extra momentum as part of saudi arabia s vision 2030, an ambitious economic reform program launched last year by crown prince mohammed bin salman. yamani said saudi arabia will soon pass laws for its nuclear program and will have set up all of the regulations for its nuclear regulator by the third quarter of 2018.   the iaea also has been requested to conduct an integrated review of our nuclear infrastructure during the second quarter of 2018,  he said, which will allow the agency to assess efforts to prepare saudi infrastructure  to introduce nuclear power for peaceful purposes.  saudi arabia is considering building some 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2032, the equivalent of about 17 reactors, making it one of the strongest prospects for an industry struggling after the 2011 nuclear disaster in japan. preliminary studies have estimated saudi arabia has around 60,000 tonnes of uranium ore, maher al odan, the chief atomic energy officer of kacare said at an electricity forum in riyadh on oct 11.

" democrats in california’s state senate announced on tuesday a series of infrastructure funding bills that would invest billions in roads, bridges, housing and water projects. infrastructure investment has been at the forefront of political agendas this year, from president elect donald trump’s promise to unveil a massive national infrastructure spending plan to voters’ support of billions of dollars of infrastructure bonds in november’s election. both trump and his rival, hillary clinton, campaigned promising infrastructure investment. trump called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years, but it remains unclear how much would come from the federal budget. democrats in the california senate proposed five bills on tuesday, including one that would use $6 billion a year over the next decade to repair roads and bridges and improve transit systems across the state.  according to the proposal, the bulk of the money is to be raised through a phased in 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase, along with increases to the diesel excise tax and vehicle registration fees. california’s freeway system faces a $59 billion maintenance shortfall over the next decade and local governments face another $78 billion shortfall for local highways and bridges. the need for infrastructure funding is echoed across the country.  “our transportation infrastructure is in dire condition. the longer we wait to fix it, the more it will cost us,” state senator jim beall of san jose and sponsor of the transportation bill, said in a statement. two housing bills raise money for affordable housing, one of them through a $75 fee on real estate transaction documents. california is home to 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, and many parts of the state face serious housing shortages. another bill proposes to issue a $3 billion general obligation bond aimed at addressing the housing stock shortage. senator toni atkins of san diego, sponsor of one of the housing bills, said infrastructure was “at the top of the list” of challenges facing california, and tuesday’s package of bills would “go a long way toward improving quality of life for californians and grow our state’s economy.” another bill would fund state and local parks and water infrastructure through a $3 billion general obligation bond. despite recent rains, california is in the fifth year of  drought. in 2014, state voters passed a $7.5 billion bond to fund water infrastructure projects throughout california.  senate leader kevin de león of los angeles, sponsor of tuesday’s bill, noted that there is still “a high unmet demand for new water and natural resource investment.” ",0

" european union leaders agreed on thursday to provide  stronger support  to italy for its work in libya and replenish their africa fund to further curb immigration to europe.  we have a real chance of closing the central mediterranean route,  chairman donald tusk said after 28 eu leaders meeting in brussels discussed migration, stressing the need to lower the number of arrivals from africa going through the mediterranean to italy. eu executive european commission told the group they needed to immediately chip in an extra 225 million euros for migration related projects in africa due to run this year and early next.  if we do want to be as present as possible in africa   mainly in the northern part of africa   we have to increase financial means,  commission head jean claude juncker said. brussels has so far committed 2.9 billion euros to the so called africa trust fund, with another 234 million euros from eu states, according to the commission. brussels said 1.6 billion euros would be spent by the end of 2017 on turkey. in 2016 the bloc promised 3 billion euros for syrian refugees in exchange for ankara shutting down the route traffickers and smugglers were using to get people to greece.  despite sour eu turkey relations on several issues, german chancellor angela merkel praised ankara for hosting refugees from syria and said the bloc should pull together another 3 billion euros to that end.  we have promised 3 billion euros for the coming years in addition to the 3 billion that we have already committed. we need to deliver on this promise,  merkel told reporters on arriving for the two day eu leaders  summit in brussels.   this money helps the refugees who are living under very difficult conditions. once again, turkey is doing a great job here,  she said. since 2015, the bloc has helped greece, italy and bulgaria with nearly 2 billion euros to manage immigration flows. it spent another 100 million euros on controlling migratory routes in the western balkans, according to figures provided by the bloc. it has been spending on more deportations and financing united nations projects for refugees and migrants in africa, and mulling a center in libya to assess asylum requests there.  despite criticism from rights groups that the eu is violating international humanitarian law by striving to curb immigration, the bloc has applauded itself for reducing arrivals by more than 70 percent in 2016 from the peak in 2015 when more than a million people entered in an uncontrolled flow. the influx of immigrants in 2015 caught the bloc by surprise, alarmed the eu s 500 million people and fueled support for anti immigration, populist and nationalist groups. the bloc s asylum system broke down under the sheer numbers  and the cherished schengen zone of control free travel was strained as member states introduced emergency border checks. eu states have since sought to agree on how to change their asylum laws, with bitter disputes deepening east west divides. tusk said on thursday the 28 eu leaders would discuss the issue again in december and were aiming for an agreement by mid 2018. earlier this week, the european parliament agreed its own stance on asylum reform, including an option to cut eu funds to states that refuse to host asylum seekers reaching the bloc. it proposed moving away from the current rule mandating that the first country through which a person enters the eu must handle his or her asylum request, saying it puts too much burden on frontline states like italy, greece, malta or spain.  southern frontline states want a scheme that would automatically lift people off their soil during periods of exceptionally high immigration and take them elsewhere in the eu.  westerners like germany and sweden, which eventually receive most of the refugees, have said more of the burden must be shared and that solidarity was needed.  eastern eu countries like poland and hungary have refused to admit anyone, saying doing so could compromise national security and affect the traditional composition of their populations.

" u.s. secretary of state john kerry paid tribute to the european union on monday as it tries to heal the wound of britain’s vote to leave, saying detractors were overlooking what it had achieved in alliance with america. “i ask anyone who questions the importance of the eu or its relationship with the united states, (to consider) not just the history that i articulated, but the increase of prosperity, the rise in the standard of living ... the better protection of rights for individuals in the eu, as a consequence of what we have done together,” kerry said in brussels. he was speaking at a joint news conference with eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini after a meeting with his european counterparts including boris johnson, britain’s new foreign minister, who led the leave campaign. his comments sounded like a jab at presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, who last month forecast the break up of the eu due to fears over immigration, and at johnson, who during the campaign compared the eu’s ambitions with those of hitler and napoleon. kerry, a democrat, spoke of the close ties between the united states and european union dating back to the u.s. role in freeing europe from nazism in world war two. but he acknowledged that such memories were fading.  “there’s a whole separation of time which has changed attitudes of some people,” he said, adding that in the face of common threats such as islamist militancy, the eu u.s. partnership was “as important as it has ever been”. mogherini responded that it sometimes took a clear sighted transatlantic view to put europe’s value into perspective. “i would like to thank you personally, and through you the u.s. administration of president obama for the strong message and clear message that we always hear from you on the need for a strong and united europe,” she said.  “sometimes we need our closest friends, our best friends, to remind us of the extraordinary value of the european union.” ",0
" president barack obama plans to transfer as many as 18 more prisoners from the guantanamo bay military prison before leaving office, a source close to the matter said, further shrinking the inmate population but still far short of meeting his longtime pledge to close the facility. the obama administration notified congress it intends to send the detainees, nearly a third of the remaining 59 held at the u.s. naval base in cuba, to at least four countries, including italy, oman, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, before president elect donald trump is sworn in on jan. 20, the source said. the notification came just before this week’s deadline, which by law requires obama to give congress 30 days’ warning before moving prisoners out of guantanamo. it will be the last in a flurry of recent transfers aimed at leaving as few inmates as possible for the next administration. but the transfer plan – first reported by the new york times   also signifies that despite obama’s pledge dating back to the 2008 presidential campaign to close the facility, it is all but certain to be turned over to trump. he has vowed to keep it open and “load it up with some bad dudes.” the administration wants to move out 17 or 18 of the 22 prisoners who have been declared eligible for transfer in parole style hearings, the source said, while cautioning that  it was still possible one or more of the countries could back out. if the transfers go according to plan, 41 or 42 prisoners would be left at guantanamo, including 10 alleged plotters of  the sept. 11, 2001 attacks charged in military tribunals. the others have not been charged but are deemed too dangerous to release. the white house and pentagon declined to comment. obama, who inherited 242 detainees when he took office and has called it a “recruiting tool” for terrorists, has slowly whittled the number down to the lowest since shortly after his predecessor george w. bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the sept. 11 attacks. under bush, the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. obama’s efforts to close the prison have been blocked by mostly republican opposition in congress, which has barred him from moving any prisoners to the u.s. mainland. foot dragging by pentagon officials has also been blamed for slowing repatriation and transfers to third countries. administration officials have made clear that obama has no intention of resorting to the legally risky option of using executive action to close the prison before leaving office. critics of guantanamo, however, appeared to hold out hope.  “while welcome, these transfers are not nearly sufficient,” said naureen shah, amnesty international usa’s director of security with human rights. “we are demanding and expecting bold moves from president obama to finally shutter the detention camp at guantanamo in his final days. he must not leave it to trump.” ",0
" while one focus of the leak crackdown announced on friday by u.s. attorney general jeff sessions is on journalists who receive leaked information, another is on suspected leakers. republican president donald trump has complained for months about leaks to the news media, but his democratic predecessor, barack obama, also took a hard line on leaking.  eight of the 12 cases where federal prosecutors charged individuals with violating the espionage act, a world war one era law aimed at keeping sensitive information out of the hands of the united states’ enemies, were brought under obama. here are the 12 cases, dating back 46 years. daniel ellsberg became the first such case in 1971 when prosecutors accused the national security analyst and his colleague, anthony russo, of providing what would become known as the pentagon papers to the new york times and other media outlets. the secret documents revealed the extent of u.s. involvement in vietnam. charges against the two men were dismissed when a judge found that the government had wiretapped ellsberg, possibly illegally. samuel morison, a former navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with illegally passing secret photographs of soviet ships to a magazine, jane’s defence weekly. he pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him, making him the first person convicted under the espionage act for divulging secrets to the press. he was sentenced to two years in prison but paroled. president bill clinton pardoned him. lawrence franklin, a defense department employee, was charged in 2005 with passing classified information about iran to two pro israel lobbyists, steven rosen and keith weissman. franklin pleaded guilty and received a 12 year sentence. eventually, after the government’s case against rosen and weissman collapsed, a judge reduced franklin’s sentence to 10 months in a halfway house. shamai leibowitz was an fbi translator when material that he heard while translating ended up on a blog. he reached an agreement with prosecutors before he was charged, and pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count of disclosing classified information. he was sentenced to 20 months in prison. former national security agency official thomas drake was suspected in 2010 of revealing information about the agency’s warrantless wiretapping program. he was indicted under the espionage act but said the only information he leaked was about waste in an nsa program, which he gave to the baltimore sun. the 10 felony counts were dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received no prison time. chelsea manning, an army private first class formerly known as bradley manning, turned over more than 700,000 classified files to the anti secrecy website wikileaks in the biggest breach of secret data in u.s. history. manning was found guilty of 19 counts but acquitted of the most serious one, aiding the enemy. she was sentenced in august 2013 to 35 years in a military prison but was released in may after obama, in his last days in office, commuted the final 28 years of manning’s sentence.  stephen kim, a u.s. state department contract analyst, allegedly divulged to a fox news reporter what u.s. intelligence believed about how north korea would respond to new sanctions. a grand jury indicted him in 2010 for disclosing defense information and making false statements. he pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to thirteen months in prison. he was released in may 2015.  former cia officer jeffrey sterling was charged in 2011 with illegally disclosing classified information about iran to james risen, a new york times reporter, for his book “state of war.” a jury convicted sterling in 2015. a judge sentenced him to 42 months in prison.  former cia officer john kiriakou was charged in 2012 with divulging to journalists secret information about the cia’s interrogation program, including the identity of a covert officer. in an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. he was released in february 2015 on condition that he serve three months of house arrest. u.s. officials said in june 2013 they had filed sealed criminal charges against former nsa contractor edward snowden for unauthorized leaks and theft of government property. snowden prompted a worldwide debate after he gave documents to newspapers showing the extent of u.s. surveillance programs. russia granted him asylum. former fbi bomb analyst donald sachtleben agreed in september 2013 to plead guilty to disclosing national defense information for telling an associated press reporter details of a failed airline bombing attempt by yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula. a judge sentenced sachtleben that year to a 43 month prison term for the national security offenses and a consecutive 97 month term for unrelated child pornography charges. the justice department charged u.s. intelligence contractor reality leigh winner with violating the espionage act for leaking a classified report on russian interference in u.s. elections to the intercept. the nsa report described russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one u.s. voting software supplier and send “spear phishing” emails to more than 100 local officials days before the nov. 8, 2016 election.

" president donald trump is asking congress to give the pentagon about $2 billion for a “flexible” fund to use against islamic state over the next six months, as his administration weighs changes to the u.s. led campaign against the militant group. trump is also seeking to upgrade long underfunded facilities at the u.s. military’s guantanamo bay detention center in cuba that trump’s democratic predecessor, barack obama, unsuccessfully sought to close during his eight year administration. “it doesn’t seem like we are going to close it anytime soon,” john roth, the acting pentagon comptroller, told a pentagon news briefing, explaining the move.  the proposals were part of a $30 billion supplemental request to congress to add more money to the pentagon’s budget during the government’s ongoing fiscal year, which began under the obama administration and ends in september. it includes plans to crank up u.s. funding for the fight against islamic state militants for items like high tech bombs and defenses against insurgents’ drones, bringing overall spending on the campaign to the highest level yet, the pentagon said. “this will likely be our largest request,” roth said. one analyst called the $2 billion flexible spending request a pentagon “slush fund,” and many lawmakers were expected to be reluctant to loosen oversight over how the pentagon spends money. what trump’s additional funding might mean for america’s evolving war strategy against islamic state in the coming months was not immediately clear.  but the request comes as u.s. backed forces in iraq and syria are entering a critical phase in their campaign to retake islamic state’s two biggest cities of mosul in iraq and raqqa in syria. trump’s administration is weighing deployment of more u.s. troops. the heads of the top u.s. congressional committees that oversee the pentagon have criticized trump’s 2018 budget request, saying even more money was needed. “it is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage,” said republican representative mac thornberry, chairman of the house of representatives armed services committee.  todd harrison at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington questioned whether trump’s budget wish list could muster enough support among democrats,  whose votes would be needed to sign off on the spending bills given the slim republican hold on the senate.        trump said during the election campaign that he not only wanted to keep the guantanamo bay detention center open but “load it up with some bad dudes.” trump’s $5.1 billion “overseas contingency operations” request included a provision for $1.1 billion in additional funds for a range of pentagon projects, including “planning and design of construction projects in support of detention operations at guantanamo bay, cuba.” the prison, which was opened by republican president george w. bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. obama reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail. the 2017 request would also hike spending for the broader defense department over the next six months, with $24.9 billion more sought to “readiness needs” after years of complaints over congressionally imposed spending caps. lockheed martin would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that proposal. some $13.5 billion would be spent on more military hardware, including five f 35 warplanes as well as army blackhawk helicopters made by sikorsky aircraft, a lockheed subsidiary.  trump also wants 12 interceptors for the thaad missile defense system. the united states is now deploying thaad in south korea in response to north korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. boeing would also gain with $2.4 billion for an additional 24 of its f/a 18 e/f jet fighters.  a further $7.2 billion would pay for things like military training, cyber and intelligence capabilities and support for  weapons systems.

" u.s. presidential candidate ted cruz made a plea to the california republican party on saturday to line up behind him in the state’s june primary in his uphill battle to stop front runner donald trump from grabbing the nomination. at the same party convention that was the backdrop for chaotic protests against trump on friday, cruz tried to woo party members with support for their long time issues, such as lower taxes and a harder line on immigration. former california governor pete wilson gave cruz his endorsement as he introduced the senator from texas. cruz received more applause at the convention than either trump or third place candidate ohio governor john kasich, who also spoke on friday.   “if we’re fractured and we’re divided, hillary clinton wins and the campaign is lost,” he said, referring to the democratic party’s front runner in the nov. 8 election for the white house.  now mathematically eliminated from securing the nomination on the first ballot at the party’s convention in cleveland in july, cruz aims to stop trump from receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, forcing a contested convention.  however, the prospect of him being able to do so has grown increasingly slim. trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality tv star, has continued to notch up wins in the nation’s nominating contests, including a five state sweep of the latest string of contests last tuesday.   cruz has downplayed the severity of the losses and in his speech saturday looked forward to upcoming contests, which he has said will put him on the path to thwarting trump. “california is going to decide this republican primary,” he said, referring to the state’s june 7 contest. trump has been at odds with the party’s establishment and has called the system for nominating its candidate “rigged.”  critics say he has played on the fears of his supporters, especially about immigration, by proposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the country and accusing illegal mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals. on thursday and friday, anti trump protests erupted outside the candidate’s california events. on friday, he was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside. cruz hopes to slow trump’s march toward the nomination in indiana’s primary on tuesday. the state awards its 57 delegates on a winner take all basis by congressional district, possibly granting cruz a windfall of pledged delegates.  a real clear politics polling aggregation in the state shows cruz just behind trump, 35.2 percent to 37.5 percent.  polls show cruz has more of a challenge in delegate rich california, where he lags trump 28.3 percent to 45.7 percent.    in an indication of efforts to court the state, cruz on wednesday made the unusual move of naming a vice presidential running mate, onetime presidential hopeful carly fiorina, who was formerly a chief executive of the california technology company hewlett packard co.  on saturday night, she urged the crowd of party faithful, many of whom had backed her as the party’s nominee in a failed bid for u.s. senate in 2010, to join her in supporting cruz. in a dynamic and combative speech, she urged kasich to get out of the race, and challenged the idea that trump had locked up the nomination. “donald trump was here yesterday and he was telling you it’s over,” fiorina said. “but the 30 yard line ain’t a touchdown.”      ",0
" at a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful koch brothers’ network, much of the talk was about the conservative political group’s criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the u.s. senate. that opposition suggests billionaires charles and david koch, powerful players in republican politics, remain at odds at least on some key issues with president donald trump, whose campaign last year they refused to back. but beyond healthcare, the kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administration’s actions, including efforts to roll back federal regulations, the decision to pull out of the paris global climate accord, a veterans administration reform bill and the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court. koch officials say their network has better access to the trump administration than they expected given past frictions, partly because former koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs. “overall, we’ve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we haven’t been able to make in the last 10 years,” said james davis, a spokesman for freedom partners, a koch backed advocacy group. vice president mike pence has played a key role, meeting privately with charles koch on friday, as well as marc short, a former member of the koch network who is now trump’s point man in congress.  charles koch, addressing more than 400 supporters gathered at the broadmoor luxury resort in colorado for the event, touted the progress the organization is making, particularly since the 2016 election. “when i look at where we are — at the size and effectiveness of this network — i’m blown away,” he said. “i’m more optimistic now than ever.” the koch brothers have been a force in american politics since the 1980s. their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on koch industries, the second largest privately held company in the united states with annual revenues of more than $115 billion from interests in energy, chemicals and other sectors.  both trump and the koch network have incentives to build warmer ties. the kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the republican majority in congress during next year’s midterm elections. attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least $100,000 to be invited. koch funded groups such as freedom partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other trump administration agenda items. during the 2016 campaign, the kochs kept their distance from trump. charles koch spoke out against trump’s proposed muslim registry, invoking a comparison to nazi germany. the network did not actively work to defeat trump during the republican primary. but when he secured the nomination, the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing democratic candidate hillary clinton. by contrast, the koch network spent more than $120 million in the 2012 election to defeat president barack obama.     for his part, trump lumped the kochs in with other special interest groups, boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him. but the koch network began showing its clout in the spring when it worked with the white house to push the house of representatives healthcare bill in a more conservative direction.     tim phillips, president of americans for prosperity, a koch advocacy group, teamed with pence and short, trump’s legislative affairs director, to help get the measure through the house.     pence is viewed as a trusted friend of the koch network, dating to his time as a congressman.     at the meeting with charles koch on friday they discussed healthcare and tax reform, phillips and other koch aides said.      short is a former pence aide and koch alumni, having run the koch political organization that became freedom partners. stephen ford, a speechwriter for pence, has worked for freedom partners.     koch operatives were encouraged when the white house recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports, the so called “border adjustment tax” advocated by house speaker paul ryan.     americans for prosperity and freedom partners mounted a media and public pressure campaign against the border tax. phillips has met with treasury secretary steven mnuchin on the issue. mnuchin’s chief of staff, eli miller, served as the ohio director of afp.     mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of congress, representative mark meadows of north carolina said at the donor retreat.     on the veterans bill, koch group concerned veterans of america was able to work with one of their own. darin selnick, a former senior adviser to that group, is now a top aide to trump’s secretary of veterans affairs david shulkin.     that group is working with the white house on the more than 130 federal judicial vacancies trump must fill, partnering with conservative legal advocate leonard leo, who has become a trusted trump adviser on the issue.     leo joined charles koch on stage at a donor event on saturday night. a koch group,  concerned veterans of america, mounted a grassroots campaign to secure neil gorsuch’s confirmation to the supreme court.     yet some stark policy differences remain between the kochs and the trump administration.     the kochs, who are proponents of criminal justice reform, are frustrated with the department of justice’s effort to crack down on low level drug offenders. they also disagree with trump’s hardline immigration stance.     asked about the koch network’s successes, a white house aide did not expressly address the network’s goals, but said trump “has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again.”     in interviews with attendees at the donor summit, opinions on trump were mixed, but even some critics found reason to praise the administration. several mentioned education secretary betsy devos, an advocate of charter schools and vouchers.     other attendees were effusive in their praise of trump’s actions so far.     “he’s walks the walk,” said al hartman, ceo of a property management firm in houston. “he’s doing exactly what everyone wants done.” ",0

" the united states must keep military options on the table when dealing with north korea, but it does not want to use them unless it has to, u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said during a visit to britain on wednesday. u.s. president donald trump has taken a hard line with north korean leader kim jong un, who has rebuffed admonitions from china and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by washington and others as a direct threat. “allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen ... of course we don’t want to have military options employed, but we must keep all options on the table,” he said when asked if the u.s. administration would be willing to drop bombs on north korea. ryan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with china to reduce tensions, but that it was unacceptable north korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. in a wide ranging question and answer session at an event organized by the policy exchange think tank, ryan also said he wanted to “ratchet up” sanctions on iran but believed a nuclear deal struck in 2015, and previously criticized by trump, would remain in place. “there are lots of things that iran is doing outside of this deal: proliferation of terrorism, weapons, violating missile tests   those things we should apply sanctions to,” he said. the trump administration said on tuesday it was launching an inter agency review of whether the lifting of sanctions against iran was in the united states’ national security interests, while acknowledging that tehran was complying with a deal to rein in its nuclear program. ryan was visiting britain with a cross party delegation of lawmakers as part of a trip to reassure european allies of u.s. commitment to the nato military alliance.  he used his remarks to call on countries to meet the alliance’s minimum defense spending requirement, and also singled out the international threat posed by russia. “russia is determined to exploit weakness and opportunity wherever it may surface,” he said, citing moscow’s involvement in supporting syrian president bashar al assad. “as they expand, and seek to expand their sphere of influence, they are continuing to challenge the sovereignty of all our allies in eastern and central europe.” he repeated u.s. concerns, denied by moscow, that russia had interfered in its 2016 election and said russia was currently interfering in elections in europe. he gave no further details. “we’ve learned a thing or two about their tactics in america and we commit to sharing those lessons learned with our allies so that you can be better prepared,” he said.

" a democratic plan to end illinois’ crippling two year budget stalemate is poised to be enacted by the state house of representatives on thursday, but the nearly 2,000 page package leaves gaping financial holes unresolved. the fiscal 2018 budget plan, which has drawn both democratic and republican support in the legislature, does not guarantee funding for public schools to open on time next month. the plan identifies only enough funding to pay down roughly a third of the state’s record $15 billion unpaid bill backlog.  in addition, no substantial progress was made to reduce illinois’ paralyzing $130 billion unfunded pension liability.  the state’s pension contribution is set to consume more than $7.8 billion of the state’s $36 billion budget in the fiscal year that began july 1. illinois on thursday could end its dubious status as the only state to ever go multiple years without a full operating budget if the democratic led legislative chamber overturns the vetoes from republican governor bruce rauner. one of the bills increases the state’s personal income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate income tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent.  moody’s investors service issued a warning on wednesday that even if the house follows identical senate action monday and  overrides rauner’s vetoes, the nation’s fifth largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes. moody’s said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills. “it’s not clear to me that they won’t quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long term bonded debt,” said moody’s analyst ted hampton. laurence msall, president of the civic federation, a chicago based government finance watchdog, said the bill does not provide stability. “what rating agencies are pointing to, even with the tax increase if the general assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved, the state still has severe financial challenges going forward,” he said.  drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for k 12 education to enactment of a school funding overhaul that rauner has called a “bailout” for chicago’s cash strapped school system. the house and senate have passed the funding revamp, but rauner has threatened to veto it. if republicans and democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in august, about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month, said roger eddy, executive director of the illinois association of school boards. “we’re talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point. that is absolutely not an exaggeration. this is real, and it’s going to happen,” eddy told reuters. the budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and illinois suspended sales of powerball and mega millions tickets. in another key area—the state’s $14.7 billion backlog of unpaid bills—the plan authorizes only $6 billion of general obligation bonds, as well as $1.5 billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose. sufficient money exists only to support $3 billion of $6 billion in authorized bonding, which in turn would generate $2 billion in federal matching medicaid dollars for unpaid bills. the budget also purports to save $500 million from pension changes, although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized. “the pension reform in (the legislation) doesn’t look like it’s really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way,” hampton said. (this story corrects fourth paragraph to indicate house will only undertake veto override votes) ",0
" congressional republicans are ramping up discussions on overhauling the u.s. tax code that a prominent republican anti tax advocate said on wednesday will produce a bill by september with a hefty corporate tax cut. grover norquist, head of the anti tax americans for tax reform and a lobbyist close to republican leaders, said a “big six” group of republican tax decision makers was targeting the end of this month for producing a basic framework for a bill to be introduced in september.  “the house, the white house and the senate have been meeting for a couple months. they’ll have a package in september,” said norquist, a conservative tax and small government activist who has met with big six members. the group met on wednesday evening and two members who emerged 45 minutes later said they were united on tax principles but offered no comment on whether they had agreed to a framework. “we’re all on one page, on one unified page,” white house economic adviser gary cohn said.  house of representatives ways and means committee chairman kevin brady also told reporters there was unity and to expect a statement in coming days. central to the discussion is the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, how much it can be cut and whether a cut can be made permanent. the white house wants to slash the rate to 15 percent for seven years, while congressional republicans are trying to settle on a permanent rate that does not increase the deficit. president donald trump and his representatives on the big six   cohn and treasury secretary steven mnuchin   are “really excited about the 15 percent rate” for corporations, norquist said. the congressional big six members are brady, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, house speaker paul ryan and senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch. norquist has played a key role in tax negotiations in washington for years.  trump is insisting on lowering the tax rate for pass through businesses, now taxed at the top individual tax code rate, to 15 percent, norquist said. the big six agree that trump’s 15 percent corporate rate cannot be achieved on a permanent basis without adding to the federal deficit, administration officials said.   such a steep tax rate cut would mean a revenue loss of more than $2 trillion over a decade, independent analysts say.  to solve the deficit issue, the white house is open to making the 15 percent rate temporary, with an expiration in seven years, norquist said. that would conflict with republicans in congress who want a permanent tax overhaul, but it would ensure rates would not have to be renewed during trump’s presidency. mnuchin said on wednesday morning that the administration would be “sensitive to increasing the debt.” “we are very close to releasing a detailed plan and i can assure you that we believe that detailed plan will be responsible on the impact on the economy and the cost to the debt,” he said. under current law, companies adhere to complex depreciation schedules for how long it takes for equipment to wear out and lose value. business groups have called for “100 percent expensing,” a policy that would let companies write off the entire price of equipment in the year of purchase. former president barack obama pushed for temporary 100 percent expensing as a economic stimulus to help reverse the recession when he took office.  the white house is considering a three year window to allow 100 percent expensing, norquist said. after the three years, the rate would return to 50 percent, which is the current law.

" a budget impasse between maine governor paul lepage and democratic lawmakers triggered a shutdown of nonessential state services on saturday, after the conservative republican threatened to veto a bipartisan compromise reached by lawmakers. lepage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. “this is about the future of maine. the maine people are taxed enough. i will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased,” lepage said in a statement announcing the partial shutdown, the first in the state since 1991. the governor’s order for a partial closure of state government went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local time after negotiations stalled over a $7.055 billion, two year budget. a six member bipartisan budget committee with lawmakers from the house and senate had reached a deal on a proposed budget late on thursday night, but lepage signaled he would veto the package because it included some tax increases. the republican controlled senate passed the package by a 34 1 vote on friday, and later in the day the democratic controlled house approved it by an 87 60 vote. but the margin of approval fell short of the two thirds threshold needed to override lepage’s threatened veto. even if two thirds of the house voted for approval, state law gives the two term governor up to 10 days to respond to the legislation, allowing for a partial shutdown during that time.  state police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will continue to operate during the current shutdown, lepage has said. a spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on saturday. lawmakers met in the state capital augusta on saturday, but they had no formal counterproposal from the governor to consider, said mary erin casale, a spokeswoman for democratic house speaker sara gideon. “right now we are in a very fluid situation where we don’t have anything in front of us,” casale said by telephone. the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in november to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. but it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million.

" a media watchdog group filed suit on tuesday to force u.s. president donald trump’s pick to head the environmental protection agency to release records detailing his communications with energy companies ahead of a senate vote to confirm his nomination. the lawsuit was filed in oklahoma court by the center for media and democracy and accuses scott pruitt, who is oklahoma’s attorney general as well as trump’s nominee to become the top u.s. environmental regulator, of violating the state’s open records act by failing to release those emails to the public. it also seeks to force him to respond to nine open records requests dating to january 2015 to publish emails between his office and energy companies. pruitt’s office has received more than four dozen similar requests from other groups. “his inaction denies the public ‘prompt and reasonable’ access to public documents and violates oklahoma’s open records act,” said robert nelon, a first amendment lawyer with hall estill, the law firm representing the center for media and democracy along with the american civil liberties union. the media watchdog’s first request sought access to more than 3,000 emails. pruitt’s office has not told the group how many records it has identified for the other eight requests it has pending. “we are doing this because these emails should be released so that people can properly vet his record before the senate votes to confirm him,” said nick surgey, the center’s director of research. pruitt, 48, sued the agency he intends to run 14 times on behalf of oklahoma to weaken or gut its key regulations, earning him strong support from energy companies and republican lawmakers who have accused the obama administration’s epa of regulatory overreach. on thursday, the senate environment committee approved pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panel’s democratic members. the full senate, which is under republican control, is expected to confirm him but has not set a date for the vote. the lawsuit submitted on tuesday calls on the court to stop pruitt from denying access to requested public records and to prevent his office from destroying any documents relevant to the requests. surgey said pruitt was seemingly unapologetic during the confirmation hearings about his “strong relationships with oklahoma’s oil and gas companies” and that the public should be aware his ties to the types of companies he would need to regulate as epa administrator. pruitt’s office said it had contacted the center for media and democracy last week to inform the group that “release of their request was imminent.” “the fact that they have now filed suit despite our ongoing communications demonstrates that this is nothing more than political theater,” lincoln ferguson, the attorney general’s press secretary said in a statement. “the office of attorney general remains committed to fulfilling both the letter and spirit of the open records act.” democratic senator sheldon whitehouse of rhode island, a member of the senate panel that held pruitt’s hearing, accused the nominee of stonewalling the request for information about his relationships with industry. “i hope this lawsuit forces attorney general pruitt to stop the cover up and disclose these emails immediately so the american people know what conflicts of interest this nominee has,” whitehouse said in a statement to reuters.

" the legionaries of christ, a catholic religious order which fell into disgrace after the discovery that its founder was a sexual abuser with a secret family, has been hit by fresh scandal with revelations that the head of its rome seminary fathered two children. the order said in a statement late on friday that father oscar turrion would leave the priesthood. it also released a letter by turrion in which he asks  forgiveness for the scandal ... forgiveness for my bad example and the negative witness i have given . the legionaries is a conservative order of roman catholic priests. turrion was rector of the pontifical international college maria mater ecclesiae, a seminary for men in the order studying for the priesthood in pontifical universities in rome. the legionaries said turrion, a 49 year old spaniard, told his superiors in march that he had just had a daughter. a new rector was appointed and turrion was ordered not to practice his ministry publicly. on thursday turrion acknowledged that he had previously had a son with the same woman several years ago, the order said. this meant he had a secret family while he was head of the seminary. in his letter, turrion said he did not come clean earlier  out of weakness and shame  and that he had not used any of the seminary s money, supporting his family with donations from friends. he said he had  lost his grounding  and fell in love with a woman during the period of turmoil that hit the order when revelations about its founder, rev. marcial maciel degollado,   came to light between 2006 and 2014. maciel founded the order in mexico in 1941 and for decades the vatican dismissed accusations by seminarians that he had abused them sexually, some when they were as young as 12. the order was run like a cult, former members said, with rules forbidding any criticism of the founder or questioning his motives. maciel enjoyed the support of the late pope john paul and was spared official censure for years despite what critics say was overwhelming proof of his crimes. in 2006, a year after john paul s death, a vatican investigation concluded that the previously denied accusations of molestation were true. pope benedict ordered maciel to retire to a life of  prayer and penitence . after maciel s death in 2008, vatican investigations found that he had also fathered several children with at least two women, visited them regularly and sent them money. he also used drugs. the vatican appointed a commissioner to run the order and phase in a new leadership, rejecting suggestions from critics that it be suppressed. new constitutions for the order were approved in 2014 but the vatican still has a special representative in its leadership. turrion s case was very similar to that of thomas williams, a former legionaries member who left the priesthood in 2013 after it was discovered that he had fathered a child with the daughter of the former u.s. ambassador to the vatican. williams, an american moral theologian, kept his family secret while continuing to teach at the legionaries university in rome, appearing often on u.s. television.

" the united states wants myanmar to take urgent action to end violence in rakhine state, where a military offensive has created a crisis that could jeopardize its economic and political transition, a u.s. official said on friday. bangladesh and aid organizations are struggling to help 422,000 rohingya muslims who have arrived since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants triggered a myanmar crackdown that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing. (for graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2xtid74) a senior u.n. official said an estimated $200 million would be needed to help the refugees in bangladesh for six months. aid workers fear a humanitarian crisis is also unfolding in rakhine state, though myanmar has restricted access.  we think, urgently, actions need to be taken to stop this violence and facilitate humanitarian assistance, lower the rhetoric, lower the tension and ... start doing the hard work to solve the longer standing problems,  u.s. deputy assistant secretary of state patrick murphy told reporters. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism over the plight of the rohingya, for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. sweden, the united states, britain, france, egypt, senegal, and kazakhstan asked on friday for u.n. secretary general antonio guterres to publicly brief the 15 member security council next week on the violence. tension between majority buddhists and rohingya, most of whom are denied citizenship, has simmered for decades in rakhine, but it has exploded several times over the past few years, as old enmities, and buddhist nationalism, surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule. murphy, who spent three days in myanmar this week, said there were  many points of responsibility  and he wanted to see everyone follow through on commitments suu kyi made to uphold rights and the law in an address to the nation on tuesday.  there s the elected government, there are the security forces which have authorities that don t fall under the purview of the civilian elected government, there are local leaders and there is the broader population, among which there are many emotions and many tensions,  he said.  significant responsibility sits with security authorities and local officials in rakhine state and we are looking for their cooperation to make these commitments a reality,  murphy told reporters on a conference call from bangkok. myanmar dismisses accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it has to tackle the insurgents, whom it accuses of setting fires and attacking civilians as well as the security forces. while the united states has urged action to halt the violence, china, which has close economic and political ties with myanmar, has welcomed measures by the government to alleviate the situation in rakhine state. murphy said the military s response to the august insurgent attacks had been disproportionate and the country risked a terrorist backlash. the attacks were claimed by the arakan rohingya salvation army, which murphy referred to as a  so called group  of which little was known. it denies links to foreign militants but the government says it is connected to global terrorism.  whether or not this organization has ties elsewhere is not particularly germane, given the fact that it could be creating an incentive for foreign terrorists to look at a new opportunity and this is among the risks that we have shared with burmese stakeholders,  he said. bangladesh was already home to some 400,000 rohingya who fled earlier bouts of violence and persecution. given the  massive numbers  arriving in the past few weeks, the united nations was expected to launch an appeal for $200 million to help them for the next six months, an official said.  it has not been confirmed, but it is a ballpark figure, based on the information we have,  robert d. watkins, u.n. resident coordinator in bangladesh, told reuters in an interview in dhaka. watkins said the situation had not stabilized in terms of new arrivals so it was difficult to say how many people to plan for, or how long.  we don t want to plan a 10 year operation, obviously, because we want to maintain hope that there will be a way for negotiating a return of the population,  he said.  we can t plan too far in the future, because it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy ... politically, it sends a strong signal, which we don t want to send, which is that people are going to be here for a long time.  and our donors are not prepared to respond to anything beyond a one year time frame, given the massive amounts of money we are asking for.  aid groups in bangladesh have warned of a public health disaster unless help is increased massively.  we need to scale up quickly,  said dr n. paranietharan, the world health organisation representative in bangladesh.  if we don t drastically improve water and sanitation we will face water borne diseases including cholera.

" democrat hillary clinton has pulled ahead of republican rival donald trump in the traditional battleground state of florida, strengthening her position in the race for the white house, the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project showed ahead of the pair’s first presidential debate on monday night. if the election were held on monday, clinton would lead trump in the electoral college by 259 to 191, with an 88 percent chance of reaching the 270 needed to win, according to the project’s results. the project, based on a weekly online tracking poll of more than 15,000 americans, estimates state by state results that will drive the voting in the electoral college, the body that ultimately selects the president. the results marked the first upward swing in the project for clinton in several weeks. the last release of the poll, on sept. 16, gave her a 61 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 14 electoral college votes. the big difference now is that florida, with its 29 electoral college votes, favors clinton 49 percentage points to trump’s 45 points, the results showed. trump has also lost ground in new mexico, where he trails 47 points to 38 points. colorado and nevada, which had leaned toward trump, are now too close to call. together, those states represent another 20 electoral college votes. clinton lost ground in oregon and wisconsin, which are also too close to call. they amount to 17 votes combined. as many as 100 million viewers have been estimated for monday evening’s debate at hofstra university in new york state’s long island, which will begin at 9 p.m.  whether that high interest translates into a higher turnout on election day on nov. 8 remains to be seen. a higher turnout would likely benefit clinton, while the opposite would benefit trump, according to reuters/ipsos polling, whose latest estimate is for a moderate turnout. trump’s easiest path to victory would depend on a surge in turnout among white republicans and lower than expected turnout among minority democrats, according to the project. in that scenario, several clinton leaning states could flip. florida, for example, would be a tossup, while michigan, wisconsin and north carolina would lean toward the republican.  the states of the nation results came as clinton’s standing in national opinion polls have seen a small bounce in recent days. a separate reuters/ipsos national tracking poll released on friday, for example, had her ahead by four points, up from a near tie two weeks ago.

" an intensifying push by the syrian government and allied forces to take the last major rebel stronghold near the capital damascus killed at least 23 people on sunday and injured many, the syrian observatory for human rights said. the group said at least 127 people, including 30 children, have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the syrian army backed by russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel held eastern ghouta area. eastern ghouta is one of several  de escalation  zones across western syria, where russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and president bashar al assad s government. a reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of mesraba and harasta. heavy shelling also hit eastern ghouta and dozens had been injured.    assad s forces have besieged eastern ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis.  ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash, fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days, the u.n. world food programme said in a report this week.      the opposition eastern ghouta damascus countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks.  a number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government held damascus in the past two weeks.       syria s six year old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since world war two.   u.n. backed peace negotiations are due to begin in geneva on nov. 28. several previous rounds of geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for syria or a way to stop the violence.    yahya aridi, spokesman for the syrian opposition geneva delegation, said on sunday it was now time for the syrian government and the opposition to  get to the table and start talking about transition, from dictatorship to freedom  in geneva.

" western countries are trying to push their culture and political values onto others, seducing them into abandoning their own, china s propaganda chief warned on friday, saying the country must follow its own path. chinese president xi jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown against civil society since assuming office five years ago, tightening control over society, media and the internet. xi has pledged to promote what the ruling communist party refers to as core socialist values, which stress patriotism, chinese traditional culture, rule of law, harmony and prosperity among others. huang kunming, who was appointed to the post following last month s key party congress at which xi further cemented his grip on power, wrote in the official people s daily that there was an intensifying  surge and collision  in the world between different values.  there are especially some western countries who use their technological advantages and dominance of discourse that they have accumulated over a long period to peddle so called  universal values ,  he wrote. such countries, which huang did not name,  are trying to seduce people into  beautifying the west  and  being compliant with the west,  weakening or even abandoning their identification with their own spiritual culture,  he added. china s special cultural traditions, unique historical destiny and national situation mean it has to protect its own values rooted in its culture, huang said. only by promoting core socialist values can the chinese people stand tall in the  forest of the world s people , he added. china has long railed against those it says try to impose western concepts on the country, such as competitive multi party democracy or the separation of powers, and the communist party brooks no challenge to its power. on the eve of the party congress, state news agency xinhua attacked western democracy as divisive and confrontational. china s constitution enshrines the party s long term  leading  role in government, though it allows the existence of various other political parties under what is called a  multi party cooperation system . but all are subservient to the communist party. activists who call for pluralism are regularly jailed and criticism of china s authoritarian system silenced.

" (this october 3 story has been refiled to corrects detention period to four weeks, not four months, in seventh paragraph.) a danish inventor charged with murdering swedish journalist kim wall in his home made submarine had video footage on his computer showing women being violently killed, a court heard on tuesday. a police prosecutor said officers found images  which we presume to be real  of women being strangled and decapitated on the hard drive on peter madsen s computer in a laboratory he ran. that, together with new post mortem evidence showing wall was stabbed in her ribcage and genitals  around or shortly after her death,  was adding to the case against madsen, the prosecutor, jakob buch jepsen, told the copenhagen court. dna tests from madsen s nails, face and neck showed a clear match with wall s, buch jepsen said, though the exact cause of death remained unknown.  our suspicion hasn t changed, it has been strengthened since (the last hearing on) september 5,  he added. madsen, who denies murdering wall and another charge of  mutilating her body, appeared in court via video link dressed in a green boilersuit. he said the computer searched by police was not his.  they are the space laboratory s tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory,  he said. the court heard he had been working on building a space rocket in the lab.  he remained calm during the pre trial session, sitting with his hands folded most of the time. the court ordered him detained for another four weeks as investigations continued. wall, a 30 year old freelance journalist who was researching a story on madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in the 17 metre (56 foot) craft in august.     madsen has told the court in past hearings wall died accidentally, saying she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on his uc3 nautilus submarine. on august 23, police identified a headless female torso washed ashore in copenhagen as wall s. madsen has also denied amputating her limbs, saying he tried to bury her whole body at sea.

" a federal judge refused to dismiss a criminal indictment against two former allies of new jersey republican governor chris christie over their alleged roles in the 2013 george washington bridge lane closing scandal, known as bridgegate. in a decision made public on tuesday, u.s. district judge susan wigenton, in newark, new jersey, rejected arguments by william baroni and bridget anne kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal. kelly, a former christie deputy chief of staff, and baroni, a former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the september 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in fort lee, new jersey. the closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the world’s busiest, which spans the hudson river to connect new jersey to manhattan. prosecutors said it was intended to punish fort lee’s democratic mayor for not endorsing christie’s successful reelection bid. in her 23 page decision, wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers’ right to travel. “political payback is not a significant government interest,” she wrote. wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former port authority executive david wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors. michael baldassare and michael critchley, lawyers who represent baroni and kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. a trial is scheduled for sept. 12, court records show. christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within new jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run.  both defendants are also seeking records from christie’s cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. critics of christie have called that report biased. separately, a federal appeals court in philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co conspirators. oral arguments were heard on june 6. the case is u.s. v. baroni et al, u.s. district court, district of new jersey, no. 15 cr 00193.

" former u.s. house speaker dennis hastert, once one of the country’s most powerful politicians, was sentenced on wednesday to 15 months in federal prison for a financial crime related to sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago. u.s. district court judge thomas durkin called hastert a serial sex abuser in handing down the sentence, which was longer than the zero to six months recommended by federal prosecutors. durkin said the sentence would have been even longer if it weren’t for hastert’s age, 74, and poor health. frail and clinging to a walker, hastert apologized for sexually abusing boys when he was a teacher and coach in his hometown of yorkville. “i’m sorry to those i hurt and misled. i wanted to apologize for the boys i mistreated,” hastert told durkin at the two hour sentencing hearing in federal court in chicago. the judge asked him if he acknowledged sexual abuse of his victims and hastert said he did. hastert, the longest serving republican house speaker in history and a successful international lobbyist who was earning $75,000 a month, pleaded guilty last october to the crime of structuring. that involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection. he needed the cash after he reached a secret agreement with one of his five sexual abuse victims to pay him $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering. the judge said that even though hastert could not be charged with sex abuse because the statute of limitations had run out, he could take the conduct into consideration at sentencing. “some conduct is unforgivable no matter how old it is. the abuse was 40 years ago but the damage lasts today,” durkin said. hastert’s defense had asked for a probation only sentence, arguing that his shame and humiliation were punishment enough. his portrait has been removed from the capitol, the seat of the u.s. congress, and his alma mater wheaton college stripped his name from a public policy center. “nothing is more stunning than having the words ‘serial child molester’ and ‘speaker of the house’ in the same sentence,” durkin acknowledged. but he said that an extremely aggravating factor in the sentencing was that hastert lied to federal agents about the money and falsely claimed that the victim was extorting him. he said hastert must serve two years of probation and go through sex offender treatment after release, and also pay a $250,000 fine. scott cross, 53, one of hastert’s victims, and jolene burdge, the sister of another victim who is deceased, both spoke during the hearing. “don’t be a coward, mr. hastert,” burdge said. “tell the truth. what you did wasn’t misconduct. it was sexual abuse of a minor.” cross, the first victim to ever speak publicly about the abuse, choked up as he described how hastert molested him in the wrestling locker room in 1972. “as a 17 year old boy i was devastated,” he told the judge. “i tried to figure out why coach hastert had singled me out. i felt very alone and tremendously embarrassed.” hastert, a conservative who trumpeted his honesty and small town values when he was in washington, d.c., said he did not contest cross’s statement. but his defense said the former politician had forgotten the incident from 1972 and had even approached cross’s older brother, tom cross, former illinois house republican leader, and asked him to write a letter of support to the judge. the sex abuse victim who received money from hastert has not been named publicly. on monday, using the name james doe, he sued hastert for $1.8 million, saying he had received only $1.7 million of the promised compensation. hastert had been out on bail pending sentencing. when there is room for him, he will report to a federal prison where he can get medical treatment after suffering a life threatening blood infection last year.

" illinois took another step on wednesday that is bound to lead nowhere in solving its strangled finances, with the democratic led house approving a new spending plan and republican governor bruce rauner immediately vowing to veto it, saying it was $7 billion out of balance. the fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63 53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue.  however, the democrats’ plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue. the spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the democrats’ fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by rauner, with the exception of k 12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. that has left illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began july 1, 2015. the state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year. “this is a repeat of last year on steroids,” said house republican leader jim durkin during the budget debate. but house majority leader barbara flynn currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.    “it is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come,” she said. the house passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among k 12 school districts, most notably the cash strapped chicago public schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. the budget now moves to the democrat controlled senate, where its fate was unclear. comptroller leslie munger, a republican, warned of “catastrophic” results if the house budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process.  a coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on wednesday asking the cook county court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

" the president of the central african republic, faustin archange touadera, on tuesday pleaded with the world to not forget his country and urged the u.n. to bolster its peace keeping force amid growing violence that threatens to spin the country out of control. thousands have died and a fifth of central africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from christian anti balaka (anti machete) militias. although unrest has since subsided, fighting has spiked this year and the united nations warned this month that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict if combatants are not disarmed.  central africa is at a critical moment in its history. we need the support of our friends; there are risks that we ll be forgotten,  touadera told a news conference ahead of a high level meeting at the u.n. general assembly.  violence has escalated since former colonial power france last year ended its peacekeeping mission in the country, which once had as many as 2,000 soldiers. france has grown concerned by events, although officials say paris is unlikely to return to central africa unless the capital were under threat. the violence continues despite a peace deal signed between the government and rival factions in rome last month and a 13,000 strong u.n. mission (minusca), which will see its mandate renewed in november.  the only force capable of ensuring security is the united nations,  touadera said.  the capacities of minusca in terms of men and equipment have to be strengthened.   national security forces are too weak to tackle a multitude of armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries. diplomats have also said that touadera does not have the political strength to impose central government rule. touadera bemoaned the departure of france s operation sangaris, but also the withdrawal of about 2,000 american and uganda forces that were fighting the ugandan rebel group the lord s resistance army and the withdrawal of minusca s congolese battalion in the west.  all of this has created a vacuum that the minusca must fill,  he said.

"i sharif, afghanistan (reuters)   german defence minister ursula von der leyen on monday said the withdrawal of international troops from afghanistan in recent years had been too rapid and she called for a longer term commitment in the hindu kush mountain range. visiting troops in the northern city of mazar i sharif, von der leyen criticized the rapid reduction in forces since the nato led international security assistance force (isaf) ended its mission in afghanistan in 2014 but said the international community had now learned it needed to be more patient.  i haven t forgotten how it was at the beginning when we got out of isaf too quickly with too big a reduction in troop numbers,  she said, adding that everyone knew the security situation in afghanistan remained tense. she said afghans continued to need support, advice and training from foreign soldiers, adding:  there s still a lot to do but i m convinced that we re going in the right direction with our mission there.   we ll need to have a lot of stamina   afghanistan will occupy us for a long time yet,  von der leyen said. u.s. president donald trump announced a new open ended policy toward afghanistan in august, authorizing an increase in u.s. troop numbers to advise and train afghan security forces and conduct counter terrorism operations, with the aim of reversing territorial gains by taliban insurgents and compelling them to agree to peace talks. at the peak of the isaf mission around 150,000 foreign soldiers were deployed in hindu kush compared with around 17,000 now   of which 10,000 are americans. u.s. officials are pressing germany to send more troops to afghanistan as part of the increased international presence but say they do not expect any decisions until after the formation of a new german government. the german parliament voted last week to extend by three months germany s military support for the afghanistan mission to allow a new government to consider a longer term extension.

" the kremlin said on friday that north korea s latest missile test was part of a series of unacceptable provocations and that the united nations security council was united in believing such launches should not be taking place.  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov made the comments to reporters on a conference call after pyongyang fired a missile that flew over japan s northern hokkaido far out into the pacific ocean on friday, deepening tension after its recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb.  in russia we are deeply concerned about these provocative launches which are further stoking tensions. clearly demonstrating that our position is that such launches are unacceptable is the most tangible thing we can do right now,  said peskov.  judging by the united nations  security council, that is a unanimous point of view which unites security council members.  peskov also said that president vladimir putin was expected to attend the zapad 2017 military exercises on monday and would observe the war games from a command center near st petersburg. the war games have stirred unease in some countries because russian troops and military hardware will be training inside belarus, a russian ally which borders ukraine as well as nato member states poland, latvia and lithuania. peskov said that putin had held a phone call with french president emmanuel macron earlier on friday. he did not provide further details.

" the u.s. supreme court is set to rule on monday on a legal challenge by abortion providers to a texas law requiring doctors performing the procedure to have “admitting privileges” at local hospitals and clinics to meet hospital grade standards.  following is a timeline of that challenge. july 2013   the republican led texas legislature passes and republican governor rick perry signs the law known as h.b. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. state officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women. september 2013 – before the law is enforced, planned parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. they assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors’ “admitting privileges”   a type of formal affiliation   at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state. october 2013 – a u.s. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision. march 2014   the new orleans based u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering texas, louisiana and mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect.  april 2014   whole woman’s health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against texas, citing the effect of the law’s implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. the challengers focus on the admitting privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards. august 2014 – a u.s. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on women’s access to abortion. october 2014   the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the u.s. supreme court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital grade standards does not go into effect. june 2015   after considering the full merits of the challenge, the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit reverses the district judge’s decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislature’s stated health and safety goals. the appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by planned parenthood. june 2015   the u.s. supreme court by a 5 4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th circuit’s ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers’ appeal. that action blocks the provision regarding hospital grade standards from taking effect. september 2015   the abortion providers challenging the texas restrictions ask the u.s. supreme court to hear their appeal of the 5th circuit’s ruling. november 2015   the u.s. supreme court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the texas restrictions. february 2016   conservative u.s. supreme court justice antonin scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives. march 2016   the u.s. supreme court hears 85 minutes of oral arguments in the case, known as whole woman’s health v. hellerstedt. the court’s four liberal justices indicate they believe the law intrudes on a woman’s constitutional right to abortion. the four conservative justices express doubts about claims by abortion providers that the law forced numerous clinics to shut down. june 2016   the u.s. supreme court is due to rule on monday in whole woman’s health v. hellerstedt.

" southeast asian defense ministers on monday expressed  grave concern  over north korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications.  north korea is working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of striking the u.s. mainland and has ignored all calls, even from its lone major ally, china, to rein in its weapons programs which it conducts in defiance of u.n. security council resolutions. defense ministers from the association of southeast asian nations (asean), in a joint statement, underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de escalate tensions in the korean peninsula . they are due to meet with their counterparts from the united states, china, japan, south korea, india, australia, russia and new zealand on tuesday when north korea, the disputed south china sea and terrorism are expected to top the agenda. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis has said he will talk with asian allies about north korea and the crisis caused by its  reckless  provocations. mattis s trip to asia, which will also include stops in thailand and south korea, comes just weeks before donald trump s first visit to asia as u.s. president. in the same statement, the ministers reiterated the importance of  safety and freedom of navigation in and over flight above the south china sea  and called for  self restraint in the conduct of activities . they also vowed to work together to combat terrorism as they condemned the attack by the maute militant group in the southern philippine city of marawi.  the philippines on monday announced the end of five months of military operations in marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years.

" china issued new rules on instant messaging chat groups on thursday, tightening control over online discussions ahead of a sensitive leadership reshuffle next month. beijing has been ramping up measures to secure the internet and maintain strict censorship, a process that has accelerated ahead of the 19th national congress of the communist party, when global attention will be on the world s no.2 economy. group chats on instant messaging apps and online commenting threads have seen a surge in popularity in china in recent years as forums for discussion, partly because they are private for members and so in theory are subject to less censorship. internet chat service providers must now verify the identities of their users and keep a blog of group chats for no less than six months, the cyberspace administration of china said in a statement released on its website  the rules, which take effect on oct 8, just before the congress is due to begin, will cover platforms provided by china s internet titans, such as tencent s wechat and qq, baidu s tieba and alibaba s alipay chat.  the regulations also require companies to establish a credit system, and to provide group chat services to users in accordance to their credit rating, cac said. chat group participants who break the rules will see their credit scores lowered, their rights to manage group chats suspended or revoked and should be reported to the relevant government department, it added. the cac did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours on thursday.     the administration also said the owner of the chat group should bear responsibility for the management of the group.  whoever owns the group should be responsible, and whoever manages the group should be responsible,  it said. the new rules are the latest requirement for china s internet giants, who have already been subject to investigations from the cac into their top social media sites for failing to comply with cyber laws.  the administration has already taken down popular celebrity gossip social media accounts and extended restrictions on what news can be produced and distributed by online platforms, and has embarked on a campaign to remove virtual private network apps, which allow users to access websites blocked by the authorities.

" a fledgling party led by popular tokyo governor yuriko koike gained momentum on thursday ahead of an oct. 22 election as the biggest opposition democratic party said it would step aside to let its candidates run under her conservative, reformist banner. prime minister shinzo abe, a conservative who returned to power in 2012, hopes a recent boost in voter support will help his liberal democratic party led (ldp) coalition maintain a simple majority. it now holds a two thirds  super  majority.  but koike s new party of hope, only formally launched on wednesday, has upended the outlook for the election after the former ldp member announced she would lead it herself.  i m someone who is always ready to take action,  koike told a news conference where she spoke about her achievements since taking office as governor a year ago. a media savvy former defense minister whose name has often been floated to be japan s first female prime minister, koike said she would not run for a seat herself, although speculation persists that she will.  democratic party executives said they would not run candidates of their own and would let members run under the party of hope banner. the party has struggled to overcome rock bottom ratings, defections and an image tainted by its rocky stint in power from 2009 to 2012. after the cabinet formally set the date of the election, abe told reporters,  i decided to call this election because we must overcome the national crisis of the threat from north korea and an aging population by obtaining a mandate from the people.   some opposition lawmakers boycotted the dissolution session, in protest against abe s election decision, which could bring about a political vacuum at a time of high tension with north korea over its missile and nuclear arms programs. a survey by the mainichi newspaper showed 18 percent of voters plan to vote for koike s party, compared to 29 percent for abe s ruling liberal democratic party (ldp). an asahi newspaper poll showed 13 percent planned to vote for her party, versus 32 percent for the ldp. both surveys asked voters their preference for proportional representation districts where ballots are cast for parties, rather than  candidates.  voters in many countries have shown they are willing to take a risk, even a severe risk, in terms of what will actually happen because they are disappointed with the status quo,  said martin schulz, a researcher at fujitsu research institute. but schulz, who drew a comparison to french president emmanuel macron s meteoric rise, added that koike s platform might not be so appealing, given its similarities to ldp policies. abe s personal ratings have risen to about 50 percent from about 30 percent in july, partly on the back of his leadership during the current north korea crisis. but opposition parties say he called the election to escape questioning in parliament about suspected cronyism scandals that had cut into his support. koike, 65, defied the ldp to run successfully for tokyo governor last year and her novice local party then crushed the ldp in a metropolitan assembly election in july. her party of hope shares policy space with the business friendly ldp, but she has staked out different stances on two issues likely to appeal to voters. koike, who wants japan to abandon nuclear power, said she would study ways to eliminate dependence on it by 2030. abe s government aims to retain its role in the energy mix, despite worries over safety after the 2011 fukushima nuclear crisis. koike also wants to freeze a planned rise in the national sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in 2019. abe says he will raise the tax but spend more on child care and education instead of paying down public debt. recent reforms will cut to 465 from 475 the number of lower house seats in the coming election.

" east 4th street, emblematic of the new cleveland as a once downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the republican national convention. outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network msnbc shoots its politically themed shows on the street.  just ahead of the four day convention that starts on monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where donald trump will be crowned the republican presidential candidate. “ten years ago, this place was a dump. a wasteland,” said john lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. “a group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.”    the sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of cleveland’s big moment. city and u.s. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to trump’s polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets. clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in orlando that killed 50 people in june, the sniper attack that killed five dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in nice. on this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. more than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on east 4th street. unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12 year old tamir rice, an african american who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime. cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind. black lives matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of african americans raised questions about justice in america, held a protest on saturday in public square. it was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches. in between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. the ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. business is slow on a saturday afternoon. “a lot of people are afraid to come downtown,” said cat zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   “some of these stores opened up just for the convention. retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. the secret service is everywhere.” black suvs have invaded the city center as the u.s. secret service has taken charge of security. concrete median barriers and the tall, anti scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors. a column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. helicopters clatter overhead.  cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the pentagon. even so, the city’s courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day.  hospitals are bracing for the worst. the cleveland clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby. if needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. the hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours. “all boots on the ground,” said dr. robert willie, chief of medical operations.     likewise, the secret service says it can handle the spotlight. “we are prepared,” said ronald rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, “and ready to welcome the world to cleveland.” ",0
" european union foreign ministers approved economic sanctions, including an arms embargo, on venezuela on monday, saying regional elections last month marred by reported irregularities had deepened the country s crisis. anxious not to push caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, eu governments held back from targeting any individuals. the bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade president nicholas maduro to calm the situation.  everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,  spain s foreign minister alfonso dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made. venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform. over the weekend, maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as  stupid.   on monday, his government said the  illegal  and  absurd  eu measures were a violation of international norms.   the european institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the u.s. government,  it added. spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to maduro, whom washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in july. but the eu has been divided over whom to target. the arms embargo adds venezuela to an eu list that includes north korea and syria, where european defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned. britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to venezuela between may 2010 and march 2017, according to the campaign against arms trade (caat), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments. in a joint statement, all 28 eu ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the eu and the freezing of any venezuelan assets in the bloc  will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.  representatives of maduro s government were due to meet investors in caracas on monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt. some eu governments want to give former spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero, the eu s main envoy for venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016. but in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in venezuela on oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc s position, having taken place amid  reported numerous irregularities.   the results appeared to favor maduro s ruling socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. in the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro government electoral board. eu ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non respect of democratic principles or the rule of law. experts say individual u.s. sanctions spearheaded by u.s. president donald trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on maduro s policies and that oil sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the venezuelan government to change.

" iran and the united states traded barbs over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal on thursday, with the u.s. leader accusing tehran of not living up to the spirit of the accord and iran’s top diplomat urging washington to fulfill its own commitments. the exchange came a day after u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson sent a letter to congress saying iran was in compliance with the nuclear deal but raising questions about tehran’s role in sponsoring terrorism in the region. tillerson accused iran of “alarming ongoing provocations” to destabilize countries in the middle east and said the trump administration had launched a review of its policy toward tehran that will include the 2015 nuclear deal. in the first reaction to tillerson’s remarks from a senior iranian official, iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif, who tweeted that the united states should “fulfill its own commitments.” asked at a news conference in washington whether he thought iran was abiding by the nuclear agreement, president donald trump criticized the accord, saying it was a “terrible agreement” and tehran was doing a “tremendous disservice” to the deal. “iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and they have to do that,” trump said, adding that the administration was “analyzing it very, very carefully” and would have more to say about it soon. under the nuclear deal, the state department must notify congress every 90 days on iran’s compliance under the so called joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa). tillerson’s letter on wednesday was the first such notification since trump took office. in his tweet, zarif also addressed tillerson’s terrorism charge: “worn out us accusations can’t mask its admission of iran’s compliance w/ jcpoa.” iran helped to create and continues to fund hezbollah, the lebanese military and political organization which the united states has listed as a terrorist organization.  both iran and hezbollah are currently fighting in support of syrian president bashar al assad’s forces. iran has also sent military advisers and fighters to neighboring iraq, where they are taking part in the baghdad government’s operations against islamic state.  the historic deal between iran and six major powers restricts tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international oil and financial sanctions against the islamic republic. the trump administration’s inter agency review of policy toward iran will examine whether the lifting of sanctions against tehran is in the u.s. national security interests.

" when the former u.n. chief kofi annan wrapped up his year long probe into myanmar s troubled northwest on aug. 24, he publicly warned that an excessive army response to violence would only make a simmering conflict between rohingya insurgents and myanmar security forces worse. just three hours later, shortly after 8 p.m., rohingya insurgent leader ata ullah sent a message to his supporters urging them to head to the foot of the remote mayu mountain range with metal objects to use as weapons. a little after midnight, 600 km northwest of the country s largest city yangon, a rag tag army of rohingya militants, wielding knives, sticks, small weapons and crude bombs, attacked 30 police posts and an army base.  if 200 or 300 people come out, 50 will die. god willing, the remaining 150 can kill them with knives,  said ata ullah in a separate voice message to his supporters. it was circulated around the time of the offensive on mobile messaging apps and a recording was subsequently reviewed by reuters. the assault by ata ullah s group, the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa), was its biggest yet. last october, when the group first surfaced, it attacked just three police border posts using about 400 fighters, according to myanmar government estimates. the myanmar army is now estimating up to 6,500 people took part in the august offensive. its ability to mount a much more ambitious assault indicates that many young rohingya men have been galvanized into supporting arsa following the army crackdown after the october attacks, according to interviews with more than a dozen rohingya and rakhine villagers, members of the security forces and local administrators. the brutal october response led to allegations that troops burned down villages and killed and raped civilians. the crisis in ethnically riven rakhine state is the biggest to face myanmar s leader aung san suu kyi, and her handling of it has been a source of disillusionment among the democracy champion s former supporters in the west. united nations secretary general antonio guterres appealed to myanmar authorities on tuesday to end violence against rohingya muslims, warning of the risk of ethnic cleansing, a possible humanitarian catastrophe, and regional destabilisation. rohingya leaders and some policy analysts say suu kyi s failure to tackle the grievances of the muslim minority, who have lived under apartheid like conditions for generations, has bolstered support for the militants. the fledgling militia has been transformed into a network of cells in dozens of villages, capable of staging a widespread offensive. myanmar s government has declared arsa a terrorist organisation. it has also accused it of killing muslim civilians to prevent them from cooperating with the authorities, and of torching rohingya villages, allegations the group denies. the latest assault has provoked a major counteroffensive in which the military says it killed almost 400 insurgents and in which 13 members of the security forces have died. rohingya villagers and human rights groups say the military has also attacked villages indiscriminately and torched homes. myanmar government says it is carrying out a lawful counter terrorism operation and that the troops have been instructed not to harm civilians.  nearly 150,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh since aug. 25, leading to fears of a humanitarian crisis. some 26,750 non muslim villagers have also been displaced inside myanmar. suu kyi has said she would adopt recommendations of kofi annan s panel that encouraged more integration. she has also previously appealed for understanding of her nation s ethnic complexities. in a statement on wednesday, she blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in rakhine. she made no mention of the rohingya who have fled. suu kyi s spokesman, zaw htay, could not be immediately reached for comment.  on monday, however, he told reuters myanmar was carrying out a counterterrorism operation and taking care of  the safety of civilians, including muslims and non muslims.  in an interview with reuters in march, ata ullah linked the creation of the group to communal violence between buddhists and muslims in rakhine in 2012, when nearly 200 people were killed and 140,000, mostly rohingya, displaced.  we can t turn the lights on at night. we can t move from one place to another during the day,  he told reuters in previously unpublished remarks, referring to restrictions placed on the rohingya population s behaviour and movements.  everywhere checkpoints: every entry and every exit. that s not how humans live.  a rohingya community leader who has stayed in northern rakhine said that, while the rest of myanmar enjoyed new freedoms under suu kyi after decades of military rule, the muslim minority have been increasingly marginalized. support for the insurgents grew after the military operation last year, he said.  when the security forces came to our village, all of the villagers apologised and asked them not to set the houses on fire   but they shot the people who made that request,  he said.  people suffered because their sons got killed in front of them even though they begged for mercy, their daughters, sisters were raped   how could they live without constantly thinking about it, that they want to fight against it, whether they die or not.  reuters couldn t independently confirm the villagers  accounts. last month, a myanmar government probe   led by former head of military intelligence and now vice president, myint swe   rejected allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing during the crackdown last year.  villagers and police officers in the area say that arsa had since last october established cells in dozens of villages, where local activists then recruited others.  people shared their feelings with others from the community, they talked to each other, they told their friends or acquaintances from different regions   and then they exploded,  said the rohingya community leader. rohi mullarah, a village elder from the kyee hnoke thee village in northern buthidaung, said the leaders sent their followers regular and frequent messages via apps like whatsapp and wechat, encouraging them to fight for freedom and human rights and enabling them to mobilize many people without the risk of being caught going into the heavily militarised areas to recruit.  they mainly sent phone messages to the villagers, they didn t ... move people from place to place,  he said. he said his village was not involved in the insurgency and even posted a signboard in front of it that said any militants would be attacked by the villagers if they attempt to recruit people. many rohingya elders have for decades rejected violence and sought dialogue with the government. while arsa has now gained some influence, especially among young, disaffected men, many rohingya elders have condemned the group s violent tactics. in recent months there had been reports of killings of local administrators, government informers and village chiefs in the rakhine region, leading to speculation the insurgents were adopting brutal tactics to stop information on their activities from leaking to the security forces.  they cut out the government communication by instigating a campaign of fear and took charge in the region,  said sein lwin, police chief in rakhine. . an army source directly involved in operations in northern rakhine also said it was now much more difficult to get information on arsa s plans.  the strategy resulted in the  shut down of government mechanisms  in some places  because no government servants dared to stay there , the army source said. a village head from northern buthidaung township, who asked not to be named, said the insurgents called him several times pressing him to allow some young villagers to take part in their training   an offer he refused.  i tried to stay safe and sometimes i had to sleep at the police station and local administrator s house,  he said. despite the largely successful clamp down on information by the insurgents, it was a tip off by an informer that stopped the aug. 25 attacks from being much worse for the myanmar security services, the army source said.   about an hour after ata ullah s men headed for the jungle in the evening of aug. 24, the army received a signal from the rohingya informer saying the attack was coming. the 9 p.m. message mentioned imminent multiple attacks, but it did not say where they would occur. the warning was enough for the security forces to withdraw some troops to larger stations and to reinforce strategic locations, saving many lives on the government side, the military source said. the raids by the insurgents came in waves from around 1 a.m. until sunrise, and took place mostly in maungdaw township where ata ullah staged his three attacks in october. this time, though, the distance between the northern  and southern most points was as long as 100 km (60 miles). the rohingya also struck in the north of the neighbouring buthidaung township, including an audacious bid to storm an army base.  we were surprised they attacked across such a wide geographical area   it shook the whole region,  said the army source.

" republican presidential candidate jeb bush on monday outlined an education reform plan that would take much decision making away from the federal government and give it to state and local school authorities. bush, who focused on education during his two terms as florida governor and later as head of an education foundation, presented what was the latest in a series of detailed policy plans on major issues.  “as the nation honors dr. martin luther king and his legacy today, i firmly believe that ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time,” he said in a post on the website medium. the united states on monday marked a holiday for the slain u.s. civil rights leader. bush said his plan would not cost american taxpayers any more money. he would send much of the $22 billion spent on federal education programs to state and local governments and create $2,500 annual grants for low income children to let parents decide how best to educate them. bush, who national polls show is trailing far behind the republican presidential front runners, has drawn fire from conservative voters for his position on common core, an initiative designed to ensure basic education standards in basic subjects such as english and mathematics. the former florida governor has distanced himself from common core, but believes every school district should have home grown education standards to ensure children make progress. “we will empower states with the flexibility to improve their schools, while ensuring the federal government does not interfere in academic standards, curriculum or content,” bush said. he said “too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources.” “we need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students,” he said. bush said he would allow for conversion of 529 college savings accounts into education savings accounts that would enable families to save tax free for education. charitable donations to the esas of low income children would be tax deductible.

" with a tight general election looming next year, mexican president enrique pena nieto faces a tough choice on whether to pursue a graft probe involving a prominent ally and brazilian construction firm odebrecht. mexico s top prosecutor, acting attorney general, alberto elias beltran, on friday fired the federal attorney general responsible for electoral crimes, adding fuel to a case that may complicate the president s efforts to shake off allegations of corruption in the run up to the july 2018 presidential vote. the dismissal of top electoral prosecutor, santiago nieto, came two days after he accused emilio lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm pemex, and a longtime ally of president pena nieto, in a newspaper interview of writing to him to ask to be declared innocent of funneling odebrecht cash to political campaigns. in brazil, odebrecht has admitted to paying bribes in several countries in latin america, including mexico.  president pena nieto s party, the institutional revolutionary party (pri), has been the dominant force of mexican politics for the best part of a century, but has long been a byword for corruption. mindful that the issue of corruption has become central to the 2018 election, the unpopular pri has overseen the arrest of various former state governors, but lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president.   if they investigate (lozoya) deeply, i think it would be the end of the party in power. if they don t, they stir up more public anger,  said paulo diez, an anti corruption lawyer who has taken on the government in high profile graft scandals. four days after becoming acting attorney general, alberto elias beltran dismissed santiago nieto on the grounds he had broken the office s code of conduct for public officials, his office said on friday. the dismissal was attacked by the conservative national action party (pan) and the leftist party of the democratic revolution (prd), opposition parties which questioned the impartiality of pena nieto s government.      santiago nieto told newspaper reforma on wednesday that lozoya s letter was a bid to secure  impunity  and that odebrecht money had entered political campaigns. nieto s office confirmed the letter s existence, as well as the investigation into the former pemex chief executive, when contacted by reuters. lozoya said in a press conference that he is innocent of all accusations and that he did not funnel cash to president pena nieto s campaign.  president pena nieto has also previously denied odebrecht bribes made their way into his party s coffers.  lozoya s lawyer, javier coello, denied his client had written seeking leniency interviews.  coello also shared with reuters a letter sent to santiago nieto, in which lozoya asked to be informed of any criminal investigation into him, and to be called to testify if needed. that letter did not mention any appeals for clemency. odebrecht has admitted to u.s. and brazilian prosecutors that it paid $10.5 million in bribes in mexico. details of the payments have not been made public, though in august, brazilian and mexican media reported that lozoya had asked odebrecht executives for bribes in 2012 in return for contracts, citing testimony from odebrecht employees.  on monday this week, attorney general raul cervantes stood down, telling senators his office had concluded investigations into odebrecht. however, the details have yet to be published.

" the supreme court on wednesday unanimously upheld the state legislative districts in arizona drawn by an independent commission, rebuffing complaints that the electoral maps diminished the clout of republican voters. the court, in its 8 0 ruling, said the commission that draws legislative boundaries did not violate the u.s. constitution’s principle of “one person, one vote.” the case focused on state legislative districts drawn for the 2012 election based on 2010 census numbers. the challengers said the new districts favored democrats over republicans by packing republican voters into certain districts in a way that would minimize their influence in neighboring districts while enhancing the sway of democratic voters. in mapping out the state legislative districts, arizona’s independent commission carries out a function that in most other states is handled by state legislators.  writing for the court, liberal justice stephen breyer said the deviations in numbers between district populations was not significant enough to be legally troubling, particularly as the state’s redistricting commission was trying to comply with the federal voting rights act, which protects minority voters. the challengers “have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation behind the plan’s deviations from mathematically equal district populations,” breyer wrote. a federal court in arizona upheld the districts in a 2014 ruling, saying the commission had made a “good faith attempt” to comply with the voting rights act. the group of republican voters who brought the case then appealed the matter to the u.s. supreme court. the case was the second in as many years concerning arizona’s independent commission. in june 2015, the court rejected another challenge to the commission’s role in drawing congressional districts. in that decision, the court found that the ballot initiative that set up the commission did not violate the u.s. constitution’s requirement that state legislatures set u.s. house of representatives district boundaries. wednesday’s ruling was the second by the court this month touching upon the issue of “one person, one vote.” on april 4, the justices also ruled unanimously in a texas case to uphold the method all 50 states use in drawing legislative districts by counting every resident and not just eligible voters. in that case, the justices rejected a conservative challenge that could have diminished the influence of urban hispanics. the case is harris v. arizona independent redistricting commission, u.s. supreme court, no. 14 232.

" u.s. president elect donald trump on tuesday selected former bush administration official thomas bossert as a counterterrorism adviser who will focus heavily on cyber threats. as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, bossert will concentrate on domestic security issues and help craft the administration’s cyber security policies, the transition team said. “we must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law ... and the fundamental principles of liberty,” bossert said in a statement. cyber security has been a hot button issue in recent weeks as trump, a republican, has lashed out against assertions that russia directed hacks of u.s. democratic party emails to influence the u.s. presidential election. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that russia was behind the hacks. in a departure from the current administration, bossert will report directly to trump and will have his own staff that is not under the national security council, trump spokesman sean spicer said.  the structure is similar to the approach of republican president george w. bush, who set up a homeland security council in the aftermath of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks on new york city and washington.  bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser under bush. democratic president barack obama merged the homeland security council staff with the national security council staff. peter feaver, a professor at duke university who served on the national security council during the second bush administration, said that making bossert report to the president was not a large change. “you could not call this a radical departure. this is the kind of evolutionary change that always happens with administrations,” feaver said.

" new york state’s attorney general and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said on friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules by the trump administration.  in march, president donald trump ordered a review of u.s. vehicle fuel efficiency standards from 2022 2025 put in place by the obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. the push to weaken the rules by the trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. they also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult. democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging trump administration regulatory rollback efforts. “in light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if epa acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022 25, like california, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,” the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the environmental protection agency including pennsylvania, connecticut, massachusetts, iowa, washington state, oregon and rhode island. an epa spokesman said friday the agency is reviewing the letter. automakers including general motors co, ford motor co and toyota motor corp say the obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. automakers have met with trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with california and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. gloria bergquist, a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers “urge everyone to avoid pre judging the results” of the ongoing review. “a process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,” california has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.     the white house plans to hold negotiations with car companies, california and potentially other states. a deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. the obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. under the 2011 deal, the 2022 2025 model year rules had to be finalized by april 2018. the obama administration completed a review of the 2022 2025 rules days before leaving office. without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in california and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. in 2011, obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

" france and the united states are determined to  vigorously  raise pressure on iran over its ballistic missile program, including possibly through sanctions, foreign minister jean yves le drian said during a visit to washington.  le drian was in the american capital on monday to meet u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson, white house national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and u.s. president donald trump s special adviser jared kushner.  tensions between iran and france have risen in recent months with both sides repeatedly trading barbs in public, including le drian accusing iran of  hegemonic temptations  in the region. iran on sunday criticized president emmanuel macron over his tough stance toward tehran and said paris would soon lose its international credibility if it  blindly follows  u.s. president donald trump.  they didn t like the word, but i stand by it,  le drian told reporters.  iran s hegemonic temptations in the region is a matter of urgency because it s within the framework of getting peace in iraq and syria that we will stop this process.  iranian officials have been particularly aggrieved by france s criticism of its ballistic missile tests and suggestions of possible new sanctions over the program, which tehran calls solely defensive in nature. le drian, who is due in iran at the beginning of january, said he would tell them clearly of paris  concerns.   we are fully determined to press very vigorously on iran to stop the development of an increasingly significant ballistic capability ,  le drian said, reiterating that sanctions were possible. macron, unlike trump, has reaffirmed his country s commitment to the deal iran signed in 2015 with world powers under which it curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions. after talks with the u.s. officials, le drian said he believed that washington was beginning to understand european messages on the need to maintain the accord.

" north korean leader kim jong un hosted a massive celebration to congratulate his nuclear scientists and technicians who steered the country s sixth and largest nuclear test a week ago, its official news agency said on sunday. the united states and its allies had been bracing for another long range missile launch in time for the 69th anniversary of north korea s founding on saturday, but no fresh provocations were spotted while the north held numerous events to mark the holiday. throughout last week, south korean officials had warned the north could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile in defiance of u.n. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the united states. washington told the u.n. security council on friday to call a meeting on monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on north korea for its missile and nuclear program. japanese defense minister itsunori onodera said it was vital to put pressure on north korea through additional sanctions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.  if we put firm pressure on north korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialogue and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,  onodera told public broadcaster nhk on sunday.  unless we firmly apply pressure, north korea will not change its direction.  kcna said kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.  kcna did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on saturday. photos released on sunday by kcna showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the people s theater with two prominent scientists: ri hong sop, head of north korea s nuclear weapons institute, and hong sung mu, deputy director of the ruling workers  party of korea s munitions industry department.  ri and hong have played vital roles in the north s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test. ri is a former director of yongbyon nuclear research center, north korea s main nuclear facility north of pyongyang, where hong also worked as a chief engineer.  north korea had said the latest test was an advanced hydrogen bomb. there was no independent confirmation but some western experts said there was enough strong evidence to suggest the reclusive state has either developed a hydrogen bomb or was getting very close. kcna said on sunday the scientists and technicians  brought the great auspicious event of the national history, an extra large event through the perfect success in the test of h bomb .  kim praised the developers in his own remarks as  taking the lead  in attaining the  final goal of completing the state nuclear force  in line with his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development.   the recent test of the h bomb is the great victory won by the korean people at the cost of their blood while tightening their belts in the arduous period,  kim was quoted as saying.  ri and hong s roles have also been noted overseas, prompting the united nations, the united states or south korea to blacklist them.  aside from the elite, rank and file north koreans also commemorated the anniversary on saturday by visiting the kumsusan palace of the sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of founding father kim il sung and his son and successor kim jong il. kcna said service personnel and civilians, including children, laid floral baskets and bouquets at the statues of the deceased leaders across the country, while enjoying art performances and dancing parties.

" the house of representatives stripped a requirement that women register for the military draft from a sweeping annual defense policy bill on tuesday, but supporters of the provision said they would keep pushing for its passage. democrats accused the committee’s republican leaders of using an underhanded ploy to undercut the house armed services committee, which had approved the amendment, and avoid what could be a difficult vote for some party members. “they don’t want to subject their members to a vote on equality for women,” representative steny hoyer, the no. 2 house democrat, told reporters. republican representative mac thornberry, chairman of the house armed services committee, said the amendment was removed because it violated house budget rules due to the cost of  registering women. he said it was replaced with an amendment calling for a broad review of the selective service. the house rules committee set up removal of the amendment from the national defense authorization act, or ndaa, during a meeting late on monday. it was taken out of the bill via a procedural vote on tuesday afternoon. but the effort is not dead. the senate armed services committee included a similar amendment in its version of the ndaa, and it has bipartisan support in the senate. the senate’s republican majority leader, mitch mcconnell, said he believed women should register, although he did not expect the country to reinstate the draft. “given where we are today with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, i personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do,” mcconnell told a news conference. defense secretary ash carter announced last year that all combat positions would be open to women, which immediately prompted calls that women also should be required to register. that worried some social conservatives uncomfortable with the blurring of men’s and women’s traditional roles in society. the u.s. military has been an all volunteer force since the 1970s, but young men have been required to sign up for the selective service in case the draft is reactivated.     to become law as part of the ndaa, a version of the defense bill with the amendment would have to be approved by the full house and senate, and signed by president barack obama.

" senior trump administration officials said on sunday that the united states was committed to remaining part of the iran nuclear accord for now, despite president donald trump s criticisms of the deal and his warnings that he might pull out. nikki haley, u.s. ambassador to the united nations, said that tehran is complying with the 2015 nuclear accord intended to increase iran s accountability in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions.  i think right now, you re going to see us stay in the deal,  haley told nbc s  meet the press.  in a speech on friday, trump laid out an aggressive approach on iran and said he would not certify it is complying with the nuclear accord, despite a determination by the united nations  nuclear watchdog that tehran is meeting its terms. the republican president threw the issue to the u.s. congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reinstate u.s. sanctions. he warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.  so far, none of the other signatories to the deal   britain, france, germany, russia, china, iran and the european union   have cited serious concerns, leaving the united states isolated. in her  meet the press  interview, haley said the united states was not saying that iran was in breach of the agreement, but she raised concerns about its activities that are not covered by the pact, including weapons sales and sponsorship of militant groups such as hezbollah. haley said that other countries were  turning a blind eye  to these iranian activities in order to  protect  the nuclear agreement. she said the united states needed to weigh a  proportionate  response to tehran s actions on the world stage.  the goal at the end of the day is to hold iran accountable,  haley said in the interview, which mainly focused on the joint comprehensive plan of action, as the nuclear deal is formally known. haley and u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson hammered away at the need to address what they see as shortcomings in the two year old international accord while simultaneously placing pressure to rein in iranian activities outside the scope of that deal. tillerson, alluding to other signatory countries  opposition to reopening the iran pact, raised the possibility of  a second agreement  to run parallel to the existing one. among the  areas of concern  he mentioned were its sunset provisions and tehran s ballistic missile program. haley also said the reason the united states was looking closely at the iran nuclear deal is because of escalating tensions over north korea s nuclear weapons development.  what we re saying now with iran is don t let it become the next north korea.  on friday, trump also said he was authorizing the u.s. treasury to sanction iran s revolutionary guards, and on sunday treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he was planning to move ahead. mnuchin, interviewed on fox news   sunday morning futures,  said he has spoken about iran with his counterparts attending world bank and international monetary fund meetings in recent days. he did not provide any details on possible sanctions.   u.s. senator susan collins, appearing on abc s  this week,  noted that trump could have taken a more extreme step by withdrawing from the agreement. but in words of support for trump, the moderate republican lawmaker said,  instead, he put a spotlight on two troubling deficiencies in the agreement,  referring to a lack of limitations on iran s tests of ballistic missiles and a  pathway to developing a nuclear weapon  down the road. while many u.s. allies strongly criticized trump s decision not to recertify the iran deal, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu praised the move, saying the current terms of the iran nuclear accord would allow it to have a nuclear stockpile within a decade.  we cannot allow this rogue regime 30 times the size of north korea s economy to have a nuclear arsenal,  netanyahu said on cbs   face the nation.

" top republicans in the u.s. congress pressed for sanctions on thursday against democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton for mishandling classified information, with house speaker paul ryan formally asking she be denied such information during the campaign. ryan, the top republican in the house of representatives, sent a letter to director of national intelligence james clapper saying denying clinton access to classified information would be an appropriate sanction for her mishandling of classified data while she was secretary of state. ten republican senators said on thursday they had written secretary of state john kerry asking that the state department immediately suspend security clearances of clinton and aides huma abedin, cheryl mills, jake sullivan and other former state department employees for security violations. the calls for sanctions against clinton come after fbi director james comey rebuked her on tuesday for “extremely careless” handling of classified information while using private email servers for business while secretary of state during president barack obama’s first term. comey recommended no criminal charges be filed but indicated administrative sanctions could be taken against clinton or her aides. attorney general loretta lynch on wednesday accepted comey’s recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted and closed the case. republican lawmakers and republican presidential candidate donald trump have expressed outrage that the case was not being pursued. ryan, in a letter dated wednesday, formally asked clapper to “refrain from providing any classified information to former secretary of state hillary clinton for the duration of her candidacy for president” because of the fbi’s findings. the letter was obtained by reuters from a source familiar with the matter. ryan, a republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said he was aware clinton would begin receiving classified intelligence briefings after the democratic national convention if she is formally nominated as expected. presidential candidates are customarily provided such briefings. “given the fbi’s findings, denying secretary clinton access to classified information certainly constitutes appropriate sanctions,” ryan said in the letter. republican senators, including former republican presidential candidate marco rubio, said in their letter to kerry that it was clear from comey’s comments on tuesday that clinton and her aides should have their security clearances immediately suspended if they still have them. “there is simply no excuse for hillary clinton’s decision to set up a home cooked email system which left sensitive and classified national security information vulnerable to theft and exploitation by america’s enemies,” the letter said.

" demands from the nationalist danish people s party (df) that  syrian refugees be sent home as soon as possible are threatening to bring down the country s centre right minority government. the government depends on the right wing df to pass budget and tax legislation, although it is not a part of the ruling coalition.  df is seeking tighter immigration rules in return for tax cuts. it wants to make it easier for authorities to revoke residence permits for refugees who fled from war once there is peace in their home countries. such a move, however, could violate international human rights guarantees, posing a problem for the government.  on friday df gave its backing to the 2018 fiscal budget, leaving broader negotiations on tax reforms and stricter immigration policies to be resumed after the new year.  however, junior government partner liberal alliance said it wants to pass tax reforms along with the budget and would not support the budget in parliament unless a deal to cut taxes was agreed. if la does not vote to give the budget final approval, rasmussen could be forced either to hand power to the social democrat led opposition or to call a snap election. the final vote on the budget is on december 22.  the government can bring itself down before christmas if it actively works for it, it is possible,  df leader kristian thulesen dahl told reporters on tuesday.  of course it will have consequences if a government can t even vote for its own budget in parliament. the prime minister has to relate to that. it s his responsibility,  dahl said. prime minister lars lokke rasmussen, who was in paris on tuesday for a climate conference hosted by french president emmanuel macron, has expressed confidence that his government will vote in favor of the budget. df s proposal would impact the more than 10,000 syrians that have sought asylum in denmark since the beginning of 2015 under rules to protect people fleeing from war and not just refugees that are personally persecuted. the proposed tightening comes on top of already strict policies for people with temporary residence permit that are not allowed to seek family reunification until after three years. refugees should be able to work or go to school while in denmark, but those activities should not be targeted at integrating them into the danish society or qualify them for permanent citizenship, df said.

" a battle between the white house and democrats over warring appointments to head up the top u.s. regulator for consumer finance is likely headed for the courts, opening any interim actions by the agency to legal challenges, lawyers said on saturday. richard cordray, a democrat, stepped down on friday as director of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), which was created after the financial crisis to protect consumers from abusive lending practices, and he named staffer leandra english as acting director. a few hours later, president donald trump named someone else to lead the agency: mick mulvaney, the white house budget director and one of the cfpb’s fiercest critics.  the cfpb, the brainchild of senator elizabeth warren, a democrat and a liberal firebrand, has long been in the crosshairs of republicans, who say it has had too much unchecked power. on saturday, trump tweeted that the cfpb   which has imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for predatory lending practices   had “devastated” financial institutions.  democrats and republicans agree that trump may nominate a permanent cfpb chief, but they disagree over who may lead the agency in the interim, a dispute which could drag on for months until the senate confirms a permanent trump appointment. the dispute is over which federal law prevails in naming an interim director. according to democrats, the relevant law is the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law that created the cfpb, which stipulates that the agency’s deputy director is to take over in the short term.  cordray, in announcing his resignation on friday, said he had named english as deputy director and that she would become the acting director. but administration officials say the 1998 federal vacancies reform act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi member boards   an exemption they said did not apply to the cfpb. on saturday evening, the justice department said in a memo that the white house was right to name a new cfpb director. the dodd frank language about changing cfpb directors is “unusual” but the white house may name an interim chief, according to the memo. such advice from the justice department is open to legal challenge. alan kaplinsky, head of the consumer financial services group for law firm ballard spahr llp, said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. in the meantime, he said, “this enormous cloud of uncertainty” will hang over the cfpb. kaplinsky said he believes that dodd frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short term, but congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up. “i think trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while,” kaplinsky said. quyen truong, a partner at law firm stroock & stroock & lavan who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the cfpb until early 2016, said the industry should expect cfpb staff to continue their work, but that the “agency’s actions during this period almost certainly will be subject to legal challenge.” despite the legal uncertainty, mulvaney is expected to “show up monday and he will go into the office and start working,” a senior administration official said on saturday. white house officials said english was also expected to turn up on monday and serve as mulvaney’s deputy. english could not be reached for comment.  cordray is the only person to have led the young agency, making this the first time that succession of the director has been tested. administration officials said the appointment of mulvaney was “routine” and that the white house had sought guidance from the justice department before friday’s announcement.  “this needs to be decided in the courts,” warren said in a tweet on saturday.  industry critics said the succession battle underlined that the agency lacks proper congressional oversight.  “the cfpb’s current governing structure is a dictatorship, period,” richard hunt, head of the consumer bankers association, a trade group for retail banking, said in a statement. democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair and inappropriate to put mulvaney   who once described the cfpb as a “joke”   in charge. maxine waters, the top democrat on the house of representatives’ financial services committee, said mulvaney would have too much power, as the cfpb director also sits on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies. “the white house would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement,” waters said in a statement.

" china wants to put its relationship with india on the  right track , president xi jinping told prime minister narendra modi on tuesday, as the two countries sought to mend ties damaged by a recent tense himalayan border standoff. the meeting was the first between the two leaders since chinese and indian troops ended a standoff in the doklam border region about a week ago that was the neighbors  most serious military confrontation in decades. talks between xi and modi had been in question before the  de escalation, which came just in time for china to host the brics summit of emerging economies, which also includes brazil, russia and south africa, in the southeastern city of xiamen. healthy, stable ties were in the  interests of both countries, xi told modi in a meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a statement from china s foreign ministry.  china is willing to work with india ... to increase political trust, advance mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the further development of china india relations along the correct path,  xi said.  china and india must maintain the fundamental determination that each other constitute mutual development opportunities and do not constitute a mutual threat,  xi said, adding that peaceful, cooperative relations were the  only correct choice . xi and modi spoke for more than an hour and the discussions were  constructive , indian foreign secretary subrahmanyam jaishankar told reporters in xiamen after the meeting.  there was a sense that if the relationship is to go forward, then peace and tranquility on the border area should be maintained,  jaishankar said, adding that both sides agreed that strong contacts between their defense personnel were needed to prevent another border incident.  on both sides there was a sense that more efforts need to be made to ensure that these kinds of situations don t reoccur.  pressed on how the doklam dispute was discussed, jaishankar said,  both of us know what happened. this was not a backwards looking conversation. this was a forward looking conversation.   hundreds of troops were deployed on the doklam plateau, near the borders of india, its ally bhutan, and china after new delhi objected to china building a road through the mountainous area. the quiet diplomacy that ultimately ended in de escalation was based on a principle of stopping  differences becoming disputes  that modi and xi had agreed at a june meeting in astana, an indian official has said. still, china and india remain divided on many fronts, including india s deep suspicions of china s growing military activities in and around the indian ocean. for its part, modi s government has upset china with its public embrace of tibetan spiritual leader dalai lama, whom the chinese regard as a dangerous separatist, and growing military ties with the united states and japan. china has said its forces will continue to patrol in doklam, which is claimed by bhutan, and that it hoped india had learned a lesson from the incident.

" president elect donald trump’s rejection this weekend of u.s. intelligence analysts’ conclusion that russia intervened in the 2016 election to help him win the white house is the latest in a string of conflicts between trump and the intelligence community he will command. most of them involve russia, which has grown increasingly aggressive   according to what u.s. intelligence agencies have told congress and the administration of president barack obama   in syria and ukraine. the agencies also reported that russia has ratcheted up activities in cyberspace including meddling, sometimes covertly, in european and u.s. elections. the intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that not only did their russian counterparts direct the hacking of democratic party organizations and leaders, but they did so to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton, not just to shake confidence in the u.s. electoral system, a senior u.s. official said on friday.      the president elect’s transition office responded by releasing a statement that exaggerated his margin of victory and attacked the u.s. intelligence community’s work on iraq, but did not address the analysts’ conclusion about russia. “these are the same people that said saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said. “the election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history. it’s now time to move on and ‘make america great again.’”  in a statement issued on saturday, california democrat adam schiff, a member of the house intelligence committee, called the russian hacking of the u.s. election “spectacularly successful.” “one would also have to be willfully blind not to see that these russian actions were uniformly damaging to secretary (of state hillary) clinton and helpful to donald trump,” schiff said. “i do not believe this was coincidental or unintended.” trump has rejected the intelligence agencies’ finding. “i don’t believe they interfered,” he told time magazine about russia in an interview published this week. “that became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. any time i do something, they say, ‘oh, russia interfered.’” russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the u.s. election. the president elect has been receiving the president’s daily brief (pdb), one of the most highly classified documents in the u.s. government and which can include details of u.s. and allied covert operations, only once a week. that is far less often than most of his predecessors.so far, intelligence officials said, trump has not requested a special briefing on russia, despite the agencies’ warnings that russian president vladimir putin is trying to undermine trans atlantic unity and test u.s. and allied resolve. in fact, two officials with knowledge of the situation said on saturday that trump’s transition team has made only “incidental contact” with the central intelligence agency. this is despite the fact that trump’s choice to head the cia, u.s. representative mike pompeo, has limited experience working with the agency. the kansas republican served on the house intelligence committee and the select committee investigating the 2012 attack on u.s. diplomatic and intelligence facilities in benghazi, libya. democrats and some republicans in congress who have been briefed on the russian activities share the intelligence agencies’ alarm about trump’s plans for the 17 agency intelligence community, which includes the national security agency, the defense intelligence agency and the national counterterrorism center. privately, some members of the clandestine service, the cia’s body of spies, said they would resign rather than obey any order to resume waterboarding or other “enhanced interrogation techniques” that trump endorsed during his campaign.elsewhere in the $70 billion a year intelligence community officials on saturday said they fear that trump might invite legal trouble by trying to vastly expand electronic and physical surveillance of suspected terrorists based on their religion or national origin. none of that may come to pass, of course, and campaign rhetoric and tweets do not always predict policies, the officials conceded.however, trump’s statements about russia and business dealings there, as well as those of retired army lieutenant michael flynn, his choice for national security adviser, are  worrisome to many of the officials tracking putin’s growing aggressiveness from seas to skies to cyberspace. obama has ordered the intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on jan. 20, the white house said on friday. obama’s homeland security adviser, lisa monaco, told reporters on friday the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. “the president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process ... and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the congress,” she said during an event hosted by the christian science monitor.

" the united nations said on monday it has pulled staff out of two districts in southern malawi where a vampire scare has triggered mob violence in which at least five people have been killed. belief in witchcraft is widespread in rural malawi, one of the world s poorest countries, where many aid agencies and ngos work. a spate of vigilante violence linked to a vampire rumors also erupted in malawi in 2002.        these districts have severely been affected by the ongoing stories of blood sucking and possible existence of vampires,  the un department on safety and security (undss) said in a security report on the phalombe and mulanje districts that was seen by reuters. the acting un resident coordinator, florence rolle, said in an emailed response to questions that based on the report that  some un staff have relocated while others are still in the districts depending on locations of their operations .  undss is continuing to monitor the situation closely to ensure all affected un staff are back in the field as soon as possible,  rolle said. rolle did not say how many workers had been relocated. the undss report said at least five people had been killed in the area since mid september by lynch mobs accusing them of vampirism. it said mobs searching for vampires have been mounting road blocks in the district, raising security concerns. malawian president peter mutharika said the reports were  distressing and agonizing .    this development has been of grave concern to the president and the entire government,  his office said in a statement. the undss report said the vampirism rumors appear to have originated in neighboring mozambique, although it was not clear what had sparked them. it recommended the  temporary suspension of u.n. activities in the area until the situation is normalized . it said some ngos had pulled personnel from the districts and temporarily suspended their programs but did not name the organizations.

" republicans pressed ahead in their deregulatory push on tuesday, with the u.s. house of representatives rules committee officially adding a regulation on methane and one intended to root out pay discrimination to the list of rules the whole chamber will vote to kill on wednesday. on monday, the committee sent three other recently enacted rules on the environment, corruption and guns to the full house to axe under the congressional review act, which has only been used effectively once, in 2001.  the republican controlled house is expected to vote to overturn all five regulations on wednesday, and then hand them off to the senate. agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation, and democrats at tuesday’s committee hearing argued that house republicans were closing off the possibility of enacting regulations that could be needed in the future.  they also pressed for more time to consider rolling back regulations that often took months and years to craft. “what we’ve been doing today and yesterday ... i would characterize as mindless legislating,” said representative jim mcgovern, a democrat from massachusetts. “i worry that this whole process is going to subject a lot of vulnerable people, and a lot of working people, as well as our environment to some pretty dark consequences.” new york’s louise slaughter, the committee’s senior democrat, while talking about the methane rule during the one hour hearing bluntly said: “i disagree wholeheartedly with what you’re doing.” democrats, though, have little power to stop the overturning of regulations. only simple majorities in both chambers are needed to kill a rule. in the past, republicans’ nullification attempts were met with veto threats by former president barack obama, a democrat. now, a fellow republican occupies the white house, president donald trump. critics of the methane rule say the regulation, which covers emissions from oil and gas operations on federal and indian land, is not necessary. they cast it as a duplicative regulation that usurps state rights and slows down the distribution of natural gas through excessive red tape. supporters, meanwhile, say that the rule keeps oil and gas companies from polluting the environment, brings in royalties to the federal government, and reduces wasted methane. those wanting to see the pay discrimination rule overturned have similar complaints, saying that other rules already cover the area and that requiring federal contractors to collect information on their employees will be expensive and time consuming.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on wednesday called on the nation’s immigration courts to decide cases more efficiently, amid a burgeoning backlog that is hampering the trump administration’s efforts to deport more illegal immigrants. sessions’ memo to the executive office for immigration review, the agency under the department of justice that conducts immigration court proceedings, called on judges and staff to do what they can “consistent with the law” to “increase productivity, enhance efficiencies, and ensure the timely and proper administration of justice.” president donald trump’s administration has so far brought on 50 new immigration judges, sessions said, in an effort to pare back a backlog of more than 600,000 cases. sessions said in his memo that the justice department plans to hire 60 more judges in the next six months to cut the pending case load in half by 2020. statistics released by the department of homeland security on tuesday showed that although the government arrested far more people suspected of being in the united states illegally in 2017 than it did last year, it deported fewer illegal immigrants. u.s. immigration and customs enforcement removed approximately 226,000 people from the country in the 2017 fiscal year, down 6 percent from the previous year and lower than at any time during the obama administration. trump has made strict immigration enforcement a major priority of his administration. the slowdown is in part because fewer people appear to be trying to cross the u.s. border illegally. another reason is that although immigration arrests are up, the court backlog has slowed the removal of immigrants who claim they will be harmed if they are deported to their home countries or have other justifications for staying in the united states. under u.s. policy, many of those claims must be adjudicated by an immigration judge.  in his memo, sessions touted a surge of immigration judges to the u.s. border and said the agency completed about 2,800 more cases than projected. in april, reuters reported that two of the eight immigration judges deployed to the u.s. border with mexico to process asylum requests from migrant women and children were being recalled because they had so few cases to hear. the department also said that from february through november, removal orders were up 30 percent over the same time last year, and the percentage of final decisions on cases was up nearly 17 percent compared with last year.

" educators and other full time staffers at tennessee’s public state universities and colleges will soon be able to carry handguns on campus after governor bill haslam allowed a bill to become law on monday without his signature. the bill that the republican governor allowed to become law had little opposition in both houses, easily passing 69 24 in the house and 28 5 in the senate last month. the law will go into effect on july 1.  the law, which affects 50 state institutions, was opposed by both the state board of regents and the university of tennessee system. gun control on college campuses is a growing focus in the national debate over access to guns.  including tennessee, 10 states now allow guns on campus, although the tennessee and arkansas laws allow only faculty and staff to carry handguns, according to the national conference of state legislatures, which tracks policies in all 50 states. in georgia, governor nathan deal, a republican, is expected on tuesday to either sign or veto a measure that would allow licensed gun owners ages 21 and over to carry concealed handguns on the campuses of public colleges and universities in that state. on aug. 1, 2016, a so called campus carry law takes effect in texas, allowing people 21 and older with a concealed handgun license to carry handguns in classrooms and buildings throughout the university of texas system. in tennessee, anyone carrying a gun under the new law must have a permit and notify local police or campus security, whichever has responsibility for law enforcement on campus. students are not allowed to carry handguns on campus. the law does not allow handguns to be carried into arenas and stadiums during school sponsored events, and guns are barred in meetings related to disciplinary or tenure matters. haslam had said he did not believe the state should get involved in such local matters, but chose not to veto the bill. “although sb 2376 does not go as far as i would like in retaining campus control, the final version of the bill included input from higher education and was shaped to accommodate some of their concerns,” he said in a monday statement. proponents said the bill will lead to greater safety on campuses. opponents voiced concern about the safety of students, faculty and visitors on campus.

" lithuania said a growing rift between some eastern and western european union states over issues such as migration posed a threat to the bloc at a time of increased russian military assertiveness. frictions between ex communist states in europe s east and the wealthier west have increased since the 2015 migration crisis and britain s decision to leave the bloc, as leaders try to quell popular disenchantment with the eu. nationalist politicians in poland and hungary have called for sweeping reform to bring more power back to member states at the expense of brussels bureaucracy and refused to take part in efforts to relocate migrants from the middle east.   i believe it s a worry,  lithuanian foreign minister linas linkevicius told reuters on the sidelines of a security conference in warsaw, when asked about polish and hungarian assertiveness within the eu.  we would like to see more cohesion,  he said.  i know who is gaining. those who are not happy with our cohesion,  linkevicius said, adding that he was referring to russia.  we are taking it very seriously not to help those who would like to divide east and west.  lithuania, alongside poland, has been particularly worried about russia since moscow annexed the crimean peninsula from ukraine in 2014.  nato has sought to reassure allies in the region by sending troops to the baltics, poland and the black sea, setting up a network of nato outposts, holding more exercises and preparing a rapid response force. some western officials have expressed concern that parts of the baltic states, which have large ethnic russian minorities, could be seized by moscow, much as russia took control of crimea. linkevicius said good relations with eu powerhouses germany and france within the eu were crucial because of their ability to help militarily.  poland, in particular, has seen ties with paris and berlin deteriorate since 2015, when the conservative law and justice (pis) party took power, over issues such as military procurement, wartime reparations and the eu s single market rules.

" the united nations must take over responsibility for investigating rights violations in yemen s civil war as the country s government is not up to the job, the global body s human rights office said.  in a report published on tuesday, the office challenged the u.n. human rights council, which meets this month, to agree to look into atrocities committed during what it called an  entirely man made catastrophe . the 47 country council has shied away from that task for two years, leaving the job to yemen s national commission, which reports to president abd rabbu mansour hadi. he is backed by a saudi led coalition that is one of the combatants.  i ...join you in asking why the members of the human rights council are not taking their responsibility and their membership to this body seriously,  the office s head of middle east and north africa, mohammad ali alnsour, told a news conference. yemen is mired in a war that has killed at least 10,000 people over the past two and a half years, according to u.n. figures. widespread hunger and internal displacement and an unprecedented cholera epidemic have led aid agencies to describe it as one of the world s worst humanitarian disasters. alnsour said this was the third time the council was being asked to set up an investigation.   that would really put pressure on the conflicting parties to adhere to the rules and the obligations under humanitarian law,  he said. the u.n. report said yemen s national commission was detrimentally affected by  political constraints .  the perceived partiality of the national commission and its limited access have prevented it from executing its mandate comprehensively,  it said.  in addition... (it) appears to be lacking any instrument, or mandate, that would enable it to channel its findings into a credible accountability mechanism.  the head of the u.n. world food programme told reuters on monday that saudi arabia should fund the entire humanitarian aid budget for yemen, or stop the war, or both   unusually direct criticism of a major u.n. donor. the u.n. report said at least 5,144 civilians were documented as being killed between march 2015 and aug. 30, 2017, with the saudi led coalition responsible for more than half. its air strikes were the leading cause of civilian and child casualties, the report said.  it also blamed the coalition for stoking a food crisis that has left 7.3 million on the brink of famine.

" former republican presidential candidate marco rubio will seek re election to his u.s. senate seat, he announced on wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a donald trump presidency worries him. the first term florida senator said the senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the white house. “but as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, there’s another role for the senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: the constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president,” rubio said in a statement. the 45 year old lawmaker, a proven fund raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing state where campaign advertising is expensive. republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the senate. he could also rally republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. president barack obama, a democrat, took florida by just a one percentage point margin in 2012 over republican mitt romney. this year, republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100 member senate, compared with just 10 the democrats have to fight to retain. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said it would be a “terrific outcome” if rubio decided to run.  rubio had harsh words for hillary clinton, the presumptive democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed obama’s “failed” policies. but he said the prospect of republican presidential candidate donald trump winning the white house was also “worrisome,” citing trump’s statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely republican nominee’s positions on important issues are unknown. “if he is elected, we will need senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,” rubio’s statement said. still, he pledged to vote for trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the republican establishment.  “it’s not the choice i wanted ... and it’s not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it’s the choice we have,” he told cnn in an interview. his announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. the decision reversed a campaign pledge rubio made a year ago to retire from the senate if his presidential bid failed. he ended his bid for the nomination in march after losing the primary in his home state to trump following a harsh war of words. the cook political report said rubio’s announcement “breathed new life” into republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss up, citing his poor senate attendance record and the senator’s remarks during his presidential campaign that he was “frustrated” with the upper chamber. republican u.s. representative david jolly, who had been seeking the senate seat, opened the door for rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  after wednesday’s announcement, florida lieutenant governor carlos lopez cantera, a friend of rubio, and republican u.s. representative ron desantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. other republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of florida’s aug. 30 primary. u.s. representative patrick murphy, a leading democratic challenger, accused rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now “treating them like a consolation prize.” ",0
" kenya s main opposition leader said on thursday that anger over last month s presidential election ran so deep it threatened to tear the country apart. raila odinga boycotted the oct. 25 election because he said it would be unfair, leaving president uhuru kenyatta to win with 98 percent of the vote. the supreme court called the poll after it annulled a first presidential election held in august on procedural grounds.  mainstream kenyans feel so deeply cheated they are openly toying with the idea of secession,  odinga told an audience in washington, d.c. his speech to the center for strategic and international studies, a think tank, was broadcast live on kenyan television.   the biggest problem in kenya right now is exclusion ... unless they (the problems) are addressed they will tear the country apart,  he said.  as things stand now, anger and radicalization is growing by the day.  a small number of politicians in odinga s opposition alliance have discussed the idea of his strongholds seceding from kenya but the idea has not gained wide popularity.  odinga s supporter base is concentrated along kenya s coast, in city slums and in his western strongholds, areas that have traditionally felt excluded from political power and the opportunities for patronage it offers.  odinga s supporters are currently boycotting three companies they say are backing the government. the opposition has called for protests on friday.  in his speech, odinga noted kenya s four presidents since independence had all come from the kikuyu or kalenjin communities, even though the country had 44 recognized ethnic groups. kenyatta is a kikuyu and his deputy, who has made clear his intention to run in the next election, is a kalenjin.  earlier this week, odinga told reuters he wanted a caretaker government for six months while preparations were made for new elections. government officials reject the idea, saying odinga had his chance to compete in october.  the supreme court is due to start hearing petitions on the legality of the october elections next week.

" journalists from nbc, abc, cnn and fox news will moderate the three scheduled debates between u.s. presidential candidates hillary clinton and donald trump ahead of the nov. 8 election, the nonpartisan group organizing the events said on friday. nbc anchor lester holt will ask questions at the first debate on sept. 26 in new york, while abc global affairs correspondent martha raddatz and cnn anchor anderson cooper will co moderate the oct. 9 “town meeting” style debate in st. louis, the commission on presidential debates said.  fox news anchor chris wallace will moderate on oct. 19 in las vegas, it said in a statement. cbs journalist elaine quijano will moderate the single vice presidential debate on oct. 4 between republican indiana governor mike pence and his democratic rival, u.s. senator tim kaine of virginia, the commission said.  c span’s steve scully will be a back up moderator for all four of the debates, it added. trump, the republican candidate, has said he will take part in the three debates but wants to see the conditions. representatives for the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on friday’s announcement. the new york businessman, who has never held elected office, has had repeated run ins with the media since launching his campaign last year, charging networks like cnn with “phony reporting,” sparring with msnbc hosts and insulting fox news journalist megyn kelly. his campaign has also black listed several reporters and news outlets. clinton, the democratic candidate, has said she will participate in all three debates as scheduled.  separately, nbc has said trump and clinton will participate in a “commander in chief” forum focused on military issues on sept. 7 in new york, appearing separately. on friday, trump’s son eric raised questions about ties between the anchor for that event, matt lauer, and the clinton foundation and said nbc and its cable offshoot msnbc have been against his father. “obviously, there’s a lot of speculation because of his involvement with the foundation,” eric trump told fox news in an interview. “i hope he’ll be fair.” representatives for nbc said lauer was not a member of the foundation and that he had interviewed former president bill clinton for the network’s “today” show, not on behalf of the foundation. trump’s reality television show, “the apprentice,” debuted on nbc in 2004. nbc later cut other ties with the businessman, dropping his “miss usa” and “miss universe” pageants, and trump sued. nbc is a unit of comcast corp.. fox news is part of the twenty first century fox inc, abc news is owned by walt disney co, while time warner inc owns cnn. cbs corp is also publicly traded.

" americans traveling to cuba will be allowed to bring home more of the communist ruled island’s coveted cigars and rum under new measures announced by the u.s. government on friday to further ease trade, travel and financial restrictions that have been in place for decades. cuba welcomed the steps, part of president barack obama’s effort to make his historic opening to cuba “irreversible” by the time he leaves office in january, but said they did not go far enough. the latest in a series of new rules since the former cold war foes began normalizing relations in 2014 will allow cubans to buy certain u.s. consumer goods online, open the door for cuban pharmaceutical companies to do business in the united states and let cubans and americans do joint medical research. for american travelers, the biggest change is the removal of limits on the amount of rum and cigars they can pack in their luggage, strictly for personal use. “you can now celebrate with cuban rum and cuban cigars,” u.s. national security adviser susan rice quipped as she laid out the policy changes in a speech to a washington think tank. u.s. law still bans general tourism to cuba, but the administration has used previous regulatory packages to make it easier for americans to visit the island under 12 officially authorized categories. the latest measures are part of an executive order on cuba through which obama seeks to sidestep the republican controlled congress, which has resisted his call to lift washington’s economic embargo after more than 50 years.  republican critics say obama is making too many concessions to cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights issues. “after two years of president obama’s cuba policy, the castro regime has made out like bandits,” said u.s. senator marco rubio, a cuban american lawmaker from florida. the steps allow cuban pharmaceutical companies to apply for u.s. regulatory approval, let u.s. firms improve cuban infrastructure for humanitarian purposes and authorize them to provide safety related aircraft services in cuba, where u.s. airlines are beginning regularly scheduled flights. also under the new rules, after docking in cuba, some foreign ships carrying certain cargo will be permitted to travel directly to u.s. ports to load or unload freight. until now, such vessels have been required to wait 180 days, a restriction that cuban officials say hinders their import export trade. josefina vidal, the cuban foreign ministry’s chief of u.s. affairs, told a news conference in havana the measures were “positive but of a very limited nature”. “today, i approved a presidential policy directive that takes another major step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with cuba,” obama said in a statement. less than a month before the nov. 8 presidential election, obama said his goal was to “make our opening to cuba irreversible.” the latest package, the administration’s sixth, is likely to be the “last significant tranche of changes” during obama’s tenure, said a senior official, who asked not to be named. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton backs the policy of rapprochement with havana. republican donald trump has vowed to roll back obama’s executive actions. vidal criticized obama’s directive for making it clear the u.s. aimed to “promote change in cuba’s economic, political and social system”, failing to respect its sovereignty. in march, obama made the first visit to havana by a u.s. president in 88 years. his trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with cuban president raul castro in december 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after cuba’s 1959 revolution. since the opening, obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing cuba to accelerate market style reforms and boost political and economic freedom. “the changes announced to cuba regulations are, by definition, significant because they are new,” said john kavulich, president of the u.s. cuba trade and economic council. “whether they will be relevant depends upon the government of cuba’s willingness to permit united states companies and institutions to engage.” “this new directive consolidates and builds upon the changes we’ve already made,” obama said. he added, however, that “challenges remain – and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights.” at the same time, the u.s. embargo against cuba has remained in place, a major irritant in relations. only congress can lift the embargo, and the republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon.

" u.s. president donald trump has agreed to meet with representatives of the oil refining industry and their legislative backers to discuss the nation’s biofuels program, according to two sources briefed on the matter. the white house meeting could set the stage for negotiations over possible legislation to overhaul the u.s. renewable fuel standard   a 2005 law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s gasoline each year, the sources said, asking not to be named. while the regulation would be a boon to the midwest corn belt, refining companies oppose it because it cuts into their petroleum based fuel market share, and because they say the blending requirement costs them hundreds of millions of dollars. lawmakers representing both industries have in recent months threatened to block administration nominations over the white house’s handling of the issue, including most recently texas senator ted cruz   who said he will hold up the nomination of bill northey to a federal agriculture post until he gets a meeting with trump on biofuels. “the president was briefed, and has agreed on a meeting. now it is just a matter of finding an hour window,” one of the sources told reuters. he said he was told by the white house the meeting is likely to be set for the week of dec. 11. a white house official declined to comment. cruz and eight other senators from states with oil refineries   including jim inhofe of oklahoma, and pat toomey of pennsylvania   had requested the meeting with trump in a letter in october to discuss the regulation. in the letter, the senators asked that the meeting include midwest lawmakers, biofuels representatives and relevant administration officials, so all sides could “discuss a pathway forward toward a mutually agreeable solution.” it is unlikely trump would be able to move to reform the biofuels program without buy in from the corn coalition. senator chuck grassley of iowa, a vocal biofuels backer, has said that such a meeting would be a “waste of time.” his office declined to comment on whether grassley would attend. “no meeting has been scheduled,” his spokesman michael zona said. a spokesman for senator cruz did not comment. the renewable fuel standard was introduced more than a decade ago by then president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. a number of independent refiners, like valero energy corp, cvr energy and pbf energy have vocally opposed the regulation’s requirement that refiners blend the biofuels, or purchase credits from rivals that do   a rule they say costs them hundreds of millions of dollars each year. cvr’s majority owner, billionaire carl icahn, served for months as a top adviser to trump on regulation. during that time he pushed to shift the responsibility for blending away from refiners to supply terminals or distributors.  but trump’s administration has so far not budged.  the environmental protection agency, which administers the program, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018 and has rejected proposals to shift the blending burden, or to allow ethanol exports to count towards volumes targets.

" the following are stories and tables about president donald trump’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2018 starting oct. 1, unveiled by the white house on monday and due to be delivered to congress on tuesday. main story   trump’s first full budget would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance programs that help the poor while it trims the deficit. the plan   if agreed to by congress   would cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over 10 years, balancing the budget by the end of the decade. more than $800 billion would be cut from the medicaid program for the poor, and more than $192 billion from food stamps. the wall   trump is asking congress for $1.6 billion for fiscal 2018 to begin building a wall along the border with mexico, far short of the amount needed for a project sharply criticized by democrats and even some conservative republicans. an internal department of homeland security  plan has estimated the wall’s total cost at $21.6 billion. agriculture   the white house budget proposed $46.54 billion in cuts to federal funding for the agriculture sector over the next 10 years, with the biggest cut in the form of a $38 billion bite out of farm supports, including new limits on  subsidies for crop insurance premiums and caps for commodity payments. foreign outlays   the trump administration’s budget proposal would convert some of the united states’ foreign military grants to loans, part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy, aid and programs abroad by more than 29 percent. energy   trump’s white house would sell half of the nation’s emergency oil stockpile and open the alaska national wildlife refuge to drilling as part of a plan to balance the budget over the next 10 years and ramp up american energy output.  financial regulation   two wall street financial regulators, the consumer financial protection bureau and the securities and exchange commission, would face cuts or major structural changes under trump’s  budget proposal. the cfpb, created to protect borrowers from predatory lending, would undergo a “restructure” that would cut the federal deficit by $145 million, while the sec, which polices securities markets, would have its reserve fund used to supplement its budget. assumptions   trump’s promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to 3 percent annual economic growth and a vague “feedback” effect that lowers the annual deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. the projections are a leap of faith that many economists and the federal reserve regard as unlikely. economy   a table detailing the main economic forecasts underlying the budget proposal deficit   a table detailing the deficit projections from the budget proposal ",0
" republican donald trump was rushed off stage by security agents  at a rally in reno, nevada, on saturday night after a false alarm as someone in the crowd shouted “gun” during scuffles with a man who held up a “republicans against trump” sign. the incident occurred as trump and democratic rival  hillary clinton crisscrossed the united states a late push to win over undecided voters and make sure supporters turn out enthusiastically on election day. two security agents seized trump by the shoulders and hustled him backstage as police officers swarmed over a man in the front of the crowd and held him down and searched him before escorting him away with his hands behind his back. trump, seemingly unruffled, returned to the stage and continued his speech after a short time, saying “nobody said it was going to be easy for us” and adding “we will never be stopped.” after being released, the man who was apprehended told cbs news reno affiliate ktvn 2 that he was a republican supporter who attended the rally to express his opposition to trump. “i came here with this sign expecting boos ... but it was just a sign,” austyn crites said.  crites said when he took it out, the crowd began to attack him, choking and beating him before “someone yelled about a gun.” after being held for a few hours’ questioning and security  and background checks, crites said he was released, and that the police “did their job.” crites said he wanted to contrast president barack obama’s reaction to a protestor during a rally a few days ago, in which he urged the crowd to respect the protester, with trump’s, saying he wanted “people to understand” the difference. “i have  nothing against trump supporters,” crites told the station. “we are all registered republicans and support many of the same candidates for local offices. i have serious concern against trump,” he added. the secret service confirmed that the incident erupted when an unidentified individual in front of the stage shouted “gun.” “secret service agents and reno police officers immediately apprehended the subject. upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found,” the secret service said in a statement. the incident began when trump noticed what he considered a heckler. seconds later people near the stage began pointing at someone in the crowd near the front, and agents took trump away. in a statement, trump thanked the secret service, reno and nevada law enforcement for “their fast and professional response.” meantime, in philadelphia, pop singer katy perry performed at a clinton rally, the latest in a string of celebrity appearances aimed at getting out the vote among millennials. “when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when it was all on the line, i want you be able to say you voted for a better, stronger, america,” clinton said.   opinion polls show clinton still holds advantages in states that could be critical in deciding the election. but her lead has narrowed after a revelation a week ago that the federal bureau of investigation was looking into a new trove of emails as part of its probe into her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. a mcclatchy marist opinion poll released on saturday of  voters nationwide showed clinton leading by 1 percentage point compared to 6 percentage points in september. a reuters/ipsos tracking poll on saturday showed clinton ahead by 4 percentage points nationally compared to 5 points on friday, while an abc news washington post tracking poll had clinton ahead by 48 to 43 percent. both candidates spent time in florida, considered one of the most hotly contested states. the 2000 presidential election was decided in florida after a dispute over votes and recounting of ballots went to the u.s. supreme court, which ruled in favor of republican george w. bush over democrat al gore. the real clear politics average of florida opinion polls found clinton with a lead of about 1 percentage point   indicating the race there is a virtual tie. trump spoke at a rally on saturday morning in tampa, florida, where he continued to criticize clinton for supporting the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, in the wake of an announcement that premiums are going to rise next year. “it’s not going to matter because if we win i’m throwing it out anyway,” trump said. shortly before clinton took the stage in pembroke pines, florida, rain poured down. people in the crowd waiting for clinton at the outdoor rally remained in place, taking out umbrellas and fashioning garbage bags into head coverings. “i’m thrilled to be here and boy is this a hardy group, rain or shine you are ready,” clinton said, her voice cracking with hoarseness. she cut her speech short as she became soaked in rain, saying, “i don’t think i need to tell you all of the wrong things about donald trump.” at the jfk library in hialeah, florida, people lined up outside for early voting. nearby, supporters of both candidates waved signs and shouted slogans, urging passing drivers to honk their horns. “we want someone to come in and clean house,” said cuban american ariel martinez, 42, a trump supporter. early voting began in september and the data firm catalist estimates more than 30 million ballots have been cast in 38 states. there are an estimated 225.8 million eligible u.s. voters. saturday was the final day for early voting in many florida counties. trump and clinton campaigns adjusted travel schedules for the next two days to states where they saw opportunity. trump told the crowd in tampa that there would be a campaign event in minnesota this weekend, although one had not previously been scheduled. minnesota has not voted for a republican since 1984. his campaign confirmed a rally scheduled for wisconsin on sunday has been canceled. clinton started the day by stopping by the west miami community center, a cuban american neighborhood, with telenovela star jencarlos canela, a miami native of cuban descent. she then visited her campaign’s office in little haiti where there is a large concentration of haitian american residents. clinton was joined by sybrina fulton, the mother of trayvon martin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot dead in 2012 by a sanford, florida neighborhood watchman, george zimmerman. while trump prefers large scale rallies, clinton has filled her campaign schedule with targeted appearances meant to court voters in specific demographics. cuban voters have historically favored republicans, but younger generations have shifted toward democratic party candidates. in what was seen as an effort to defend typically democratic turf, clinton on monday will campaign in grand rapids, michigan, before returning to pennsylvania for a rally in philadelphia with president barack obama and first lady michelle obama, and former president bill clinton. trump is to make stops on sunday in iowa, minnesota, michigan, pennsylvania and virginia to try to steal away some states that have gone democratic in recent presidential elections.

" more than 33,000 migrants have died at sea trying to reach european shores since 2000, making the mediterranean  by far the world s deadliest border , the united nations migration agency said on friday. after record arrivals from 2014 to 2016, the european union s deal with turkey to stop arrivals to greece and blocks on migrants inside libya and off its coast have greatly reduced the flow, the international organization for migration (iom) said. professor philippe fargues of the european university institute in florence, author of the report, said the figures probably underestimated the actual scale of the human tragedy.   the report states that at least 33,761 migrants were reported to have died or gone missing in the mediterranean between the year 2000 to 2017. this number is as of june 30,  iom s jorge galindo told a geneva news briefing.  it concludes that europe s mediterranean border is by far the world s deadliest,  he said. so far this year some 161,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in europe by sea, about 75 percent of them landing in italy with the rest in greece, cyprus and spain, according to iom figures. nearly 3,000 others are dead or missing, it said.  shutting the shorter and less dangerous routes can open longer and more dangerous routes, thus increasing the likelihood of dying at sea,  fargues said. the report said:  cooperation with turkey to stem irregular flows is now being replicated with libya, the main country of departure of migrants smuggled along the central route; however, such an approach is not only morally reprehensible but likely to be unsuccessful, given the context of extremely poor governance, instability and political fragmentation in libya.  though sea arrivals to italy are down almost a third this year, this week there was a surge in rescues and attempted crossings. on friday, libya s eu backed coastguard intercepted more than 600 mainly sub saharan african migrants, including many women and children, from a total of five boats that had left from the coast east of the libyan capital, tripoli, coast guard officials said. on wednesday and thursday, italy s coast guard said some 1,600 migrants were rescued from nearly 20 vessels in the central mediterranean.  libya s u.n. backed government said on thursday it was investigating reports of african migrants being sold as slaves and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. footage broadcast by cnn appearing to show african migrants being traded in libya sparked an international outcry and protests in europe and africa.

" lebanon s parliament on thursday approved the first state budget in 12 years, a vital step towards reforming the fragile economy and preventing rising debt spinning out of control.  successive governments have failed to pass annual budgets due to a string of political crises since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik al hariri.  (passing the budget) is a fundamental step on the state s path to reinstating order in the public finances,  minister of finance ali hassan khalil said after the vote.   passing a budget was a priority for the government of rafik s son, saad al hariri, which took office in january. hariri described the 2017 budget as an  historic achievement  and said his government would strive to return the country to financial and political health. a main obstacle to passing the 2017 and previous budgets has been demands from some politicians that an audit of extra budgetary spending from previous years be carried out. but on wednesday, parliament approved a law allowing the budget to be passed before such an audit is completed and giving the minister of finance up to a year to carry it out. the budget passed after three days of discussion by 61 votes for and four against. eight members of parliament abstained.   lebanon s economic growth has been battered by years of paralysis in government decision making and six years of war in neighboring syria. growth slowed to just over 1 percent a year from an average of 8 percent before the syrian war. lebanon s debt has also risen strongly since the war began in 2011. moody s says the debt to gross domestic product ratio, which indicates a country s ability to pay back its debt, is the world s third highest and will reach almost 140 percent in 2018. economists have said a budget was vital to reforming public finances, but that more needs to be done to improve growth and investor confidence in the country: reform the heavily subsidized electricity sector, boost tax collection and upgrade crumbling infrastructure.  the government will begin work on the 2018 budget next week, hariri and khalil said. khalil said it will include a vision to develop the country economically and socially as well as  financial and reform measures to reduce the deficit and increase growth .

" the european union s support for the libyan coast guard is leading to the arbitrary and indefinite imprisonment of migrants in  inhuman  conditions, the u.n. human rights chief said on tuesday. the eu anti trafficking mission sophia has helped train tripoli s coast guard, while italy has supplied it with four patrol boats. italy also has sent millions of euros and a navy repair ship to fix libya s marine fleet. so far in 2017, the libyans have intercepted almost 20,000 migrants at sea, according to the international organization for migration. after being taken from the boats, they are brought to land and put in  detention centers  that were visited by united nations personnel.  monitors were shocked by what they witnessed,  high commissioner on human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said in a statement.  they saw  thousands of emaciated and traumatized men, women and children piled on top of each other, locked up in hangars with no access to the most basic necessities, and stripped of their human dignity,  he said.  some 20,000 people are now being held in facilities controlled by tripoli s migration department, up from 7,000 in september, the u.n. said in a statement. while u.n. agencies and other humanitarian groups have access to them and seek to provide health care and some food, zeid said it was not enough because  the eu and its member states have done nothing so far to reduce the level of abuses suffered by migrants .  just a day ago, european and african ministers repeated a pledge to try to improve conditions for migrants in libya, and on saturday italian prime minister paolo gentiloni hailed italian immigration policy.  italy is the only country in europe with a decent migration policy,  gentiloni said.  we re proud because we don t build walls or close ports.  but it was italy that struck a deal with the u.n. backed tripoli in february, which was endorsed by the whole of the eu, aimed at blocking migrants in libya, much as the eu deal with turkey did last year.   that agreement, combined with the support for the libyan coast guard, has brought migrant sea arrivals down dramatically in recent months. this year there have been 115,000 sea arrivals in italy, down 31 percent from last year, official data from italy s interior ministry show. in october alone arrivals dropped by 76 percent from a year earlier.

" with warm words from chinese president xi jinping on sunday, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson ended his first trip to asia since taking office with an agreement to work together with china on north korea and putting aside trickier issues. china has been irritated at being repeatedly told by washington to rein in north korea’s nuclear and missile programs and the u.s. decision to base an advanced missile defense system in south korea. beijing is also deeply suspicious of u.s. intentions toward self ruled taiwan, which china claims as its own, with the trump administration crafting a big new arms package for the island that is bound to anger china. but meeting in beijing’s great hall of the people, those issues were brushed aside by xi and tillerson, at least in front of reporters, with xi saying tillerson had made a lot of efforts to achieve a smooth transition in a new era of relations.  “you said that china u.s. relations can only be friendly. i express my appreciation for this,” xi said.  xi said he had communicated with president donald trump several times through telephone conversations and messages.  “we both believe that china u.s. cooperation henceforth is the direction we are both striving for. we are both expecting a new era for constructive development,” xi said. “the joint interests of china and the united states far outweigh the differences, and cooperation is the only correct choice for us both,” xi added, in comments carried by china’s foreign ministry. china and the united states must strengthen coordination of hot regional issues, respect each other’s core interests and major concerns, and protect the broad stability of ties, xi said. tillerson replied that trump looks forward to enhancing understanding with china and the opportunity for a visit in the future. tillerson said trump places a “very high value on the communications that have already occurred” between xi and trump. “and he looks forward to enhancing that understanding in the opportunity for a visit in the future,” tillerson said. “we know that through further dialogue we will achieve a greater understanding that will lead to a strengthened, strengthening of the ties between china and the united states and set the tone for our future relationship of cooperation.” trump has so far been an unpredictable partner for china,  attacking beijing on issues ranging from trade to the south china sea and in december by talking to taiwan president tsai ing wen. before tillerson arrived in beijing on saturday, trump said north korea was “behaving very badly” and accused china of doing little to resolve the crisis over the north’s weapons programs. speaking in seoul on friday, tillerson issued the trump administration’s starkest warning yet to north korea, saying in seoul that a military response would be “on the table” if pyongyang took action to threaten south korean and u.s. forces. still, china and the united states appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between xi and trump. both tillerson and chinese foreign minister wang yi struck a more conciliatory tone in their meeting, with tillerson saying the united states and china would work together to get nuclear armed north korea take “a different course”. underscoring the tensions, north korea conducted a test of a new high thrust engine at its tongchang ri rocket launch station and leader kim jong un said the successful test was “a new birth” of its rocket industry, pyongyang’s official media said on sunday. north korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches, in defiance of u.n. sanctions, and is believed by experts and government officials to be working to develop nuclear warhead missiles that could reach the united states. washington wants china, the north’s neighbor and main trading partner, to use its influence to rein in the weapons programs. china says it is committed to enforcing u.n. sanctions on north korea, but all sides have a responsibility to lessen tensions and get back to the negotiating table. chinese official also repeatedly say they do not have the influence over north korea that washington and others believe, and express fears poverty struck north korea could collapse if it were cut off completely, pushing destabilizing waves of refugees into northeastern china.

" the north korean soldier critically wounded when making a dash to the south last month may have cheated death, but even as his health improves, he is months if not years away from finding a normal life in south korea, officials and other defectors say.  the transition to life in the democratic and prosperous south can be difficult for any defector from the isolated and impoverished north, let alone for a soldier from an elite border unit with potentially actionable military intelligence and a high profile that may complicate efforts to blend in. the 24 year old soldier, identified only by his surname oh, has been released from intensive care after being shot five times during his daring defection, but is still battling a hepatitis b infection which could delay his transfer to a military hospital for some time, doctors said.  as active duty soldier defectors have up to date information, the intelligence agencies would question the soldiers and see if anything needs to be addressed in our military s operation and combat plans,  a current south korean government official involved in resettling north korean refugees told reuters. oh will likely be under the protection of south korea s spy agency, the national intelligence service (nis), and then be offered work such as code cracking in the military or related agencies, a former senior south korean government official said.   the decision would be made after a comprehensive assessment on what he means to national security, the level of information he has, and whether he would be capable of mingling with other defectors at the resettlement center,  the former official said. defections by active duty soldiers are extremely rare, once a year or less. intelligence agencies are keen to question oh, who was stationed in the joint security area near the heavily fortified border, according to south korean lawmakers briefed by the nis.  doctors have asked that officials wait until oh is fully recovered both physically and emotionally before they begin questioning. given his high profile escape and status as a member from an elite border unit, oh will likely be given more personalized assistance, away from other north korean defectors at the hanawon resettlement center, the former south korean official said.  most defectors undergo security questioning by the national intelligence service for a few days up to several months in extreme cases, before being moved to the hanawon resettlement center.  there they receive mandatory three month education on life in the capitalist south, from taking public transportation to opening a bank account to creating an email address.  it s where you would get to see the outside world for the first time, as they take you out to meet people on the streets and learn how to access the social service network. these days, you can also do a homestay with an ordinary south korean family,  said ji seong ho, a 35 year old defector who heads now, action and unity for human rights (nauh), a group that rescues and resettles north korean refugees.  such training can be more useful for some people than others, said kim jin soo, a 29 year old former member of the north korean secret police who defected to the south in 2011.  looking back, it would ve been really useful if they taught more realistic things even though it might discourage people, like how to prepare for a job fair and find a suitable workplace and why it s important to lose the north korean accent,  he said.   fresh off hanawon, you re like a one year old baby. but those are the things that would pose a real obstacle when you actually go out there on your own,  said kim, who now works at a advertising firm in seoul.  after leaving hanawon, central and local governments provide defectors 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year   barely a fifth of south korea s annual average income   as well as support in housing, education and job training. police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security.  oh may have potential value to the south korean government or organizations that try to highlight conditions in north korea, but it will be up to him whether he wants to live a life in the limelight, said sokeel park, country director for liberty in north korea, which helps north korean refugees.  if he has any mind to get involved in that kind of stuff then there will be all kinds of media or non governmental organizations who would fall over themselves to give him that platform,  said park.   but if he makes a good recovery and he chooses to blend it, then he s just another young guy with a vague back story.  graphic: defector braves hail of bullets reut.rs/2zaudrn ",0

" india is considering supplying arms to myanmar s government in a sign of strong support for a neighbor that faces criticism for its crackdown on rohingya muslims. the arms were discussed during a visit by the chief of myanmar s navy, indian officials said on thursday. the two sides also talked about training myanmar sailors on top of the courses taught to its army officers at elite indian defense institutions. india s decision to discuss enhancing military cooperation with its eastern neighbor appears part of a push to counter chinese influence in the region. it comes at a time when western countries are stepping up pressure on myanmar s government for violence against rohingya muslims in its northwestern rakhine state. myanmar rejects the charge, saying its forces are tackling insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army who it has accused of setting fires and attacking civilians. britain said this week it was suspending its training program for the myanmar military, demanding it take steps to end the violence against civilians. on wednesday, the commander in chief of the myanmar navy admiral tin aung san met indian defence minister nirmala sitaraman and the chiefs of india s army, navy and air force. the two sides are discussing the supply of offshore patrol boats, a military official said. the myanmar navy chief also visited the naval ship building site in mumbai as part of the four day trip that ends on thursday.  myanmar is a pillar of our look east policy and defense is a large part of the relationship,  said the official.  in 2013, india offered to supply equipment such as artillery guns, radars and night vision devices to myanmar s army. since then, the focus has shifted to naval cooperation as india seeks to push back against chinese influence in the region.  the two sides are expected to increase coordinated patrols in the bay of bengal that help the two navies operate together.  the fact that the indian government is receiving a high level military officer at a time when the international community is criticizing the military sends out a signal,  said k.yhome who specializes on india s neighborhood policy at the new delhi based observer research foundation.   the message is (that) india is with the myanmar government so far as the rohingya issue is concerned,  he said. since the crisis erupted in rakhine last month, new delhi has been supportive of de facto leader aung saan suu kyi, condemning insurgent attacks on security forces that prompted a military crackdown against the rohingya. only later as international criticism mounted, india expressed concern at the flight of hundreds of thousands of refugees into neighboring bangladesh. china has also stood by the myanmar government. this week foreign minister wang yi told u.n. secretary general ant nio guterres that it supported myanmar s efforts to protect its national security and opposes recent violent attacks in rakhine.

" communist run cuba extended the term of its current leadership to april on thursday, signaling a two month delay in the historic handover from raul castro to a new president, while announcing tighter regulations on the non state sector. castro, 86, was originally set to step down in february after two consecutive terms, ending nearly 60 years of castro brothers  rule and marking a transition from the leaders of the 1959 revolution to a new, younger generation. the national assembly, however, said that devastation wrought by hurricane irma in september had caused a delay to the start of the political cycle in which voters and electoral commissions pick delegates of municipal, provincial and national assemblies who then select a council of state and president. as a result, the assembly, which is holding one of its twice yearly meetings, extended its term through to april 19.  when the national assembly is constituted, i will have concluded my second and last mandate, and cuba will have a new president,  castro said, according to state run media.  all that is left for me is to wish you and our people a happy new year,  he said. castro, who officially took over the presidency from his late, older brother, fidel castro, in 2008, is set to remain head of the communist party, the only legal party in cuba and its guiding force. his heir apparent, first vice president miguel diaz canel, 57, was born the year after the revolution but has argued for the need to defend its achievements and provide continuity. analysts say diaz canel is unlikely to reveal his true colors until he is designated president, and even then his room to maneuver could be limited by the need to establish himself as a legitimate successor to the  historic generation.  hopes that the next president might deepen market reforms to the centrally planned economy introduced by castro were dampened on thursday by the announcement of new regulations on the fledgling private and cooperative sectors. state run media cited marino murillo, chief of the reform commission, as saying that income distribution at cooperatives would be more closely regulated and business licenses would be limited to one per person.  the economic measures announced today suggest a continued slowing down, if not an undoing, of the economic reforms implemented between 2010 and 2016,  said michael bustamante, an assistant professor of latin american history at florida international university. cuba s political transition comes as it faces a host of  challenges from declining aid from socialist ally venezuela to u.s. president donald trump s partial reversal of the u.s. cuban detente and tightening of the decades old u.s. embargo.  we have witnessed a serious and gradual deterioration in relations with the united states that cannot be blamed on our country,  castro was cited by state run media as saying. he said the united states was fabricating pretexts to continue its failed policy toward cuba. the trump administration said this year that u.s. diplomats in havana had been victims of  health attacks . a cash crunch has left cuba behind on payments to its foreign providers, thereby affecting imports, economy minister ricardo cabrisas told the assembly. hurricane irma also caused damage worth the equivalent of 13.2 billion pesos, cabrisas said. when evaluating damages from natural disasters, cuba traditionally assumes a peso is equal to one u.s. dollar. many other official exchange rates exist in cuba, valuing the peso at much less. the economy nonetheless recovered this year from recession in 2016   the first in nearly a quarter century   growing 1.6 percent, the minister said, citing expansion in the tourism, transport and communications, agriculture and construction sectors. despite hurricane irma and a renewed u.s. crackdown on travel to cuba, the number of foreign visitors grew 19.7 percent on the year to 4.3 million in the first 11 months of 2017, tourism minister manuel marrero told parliament earlier this week. cabrisas forecast the economy would grow around 2 percent next year.

" hezbollah s leader said on friday that saudi arabia had declared war on lebanon and his iran backed group, accusing riyadh of detaining saad al hariri and forcing him to resign as lebanon s prime minister to destabilize the country. france became the first western country to indicate that saudi arabia was holding hariri against his will, saying it wished for him to have  all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in lebanon . hariri s resignation has plunged lebanon into crisis, thrusting the small arab country back to the forefront of regional rivalry between the sunni muslim monarchy saudi arabia and shi ite revolutionary iran.     sayyed hassan nasrallah, the hezbollah leader, said saudi arabia s detention of hariri, a long time saudi ally who declared his resignation while in riyadh last saturday, was an insult to all lebanese and he must return to lebanon.      let us say things as they are: the man is detained in saudi arabia and forbidden until this moment from returning to lebanon,  nasrallah said in a televised speech.  it is clear that saudi arabia and saudi officials have declared war on lebanon and on hezbollah in lebanon,  he said.     his comments mirror an accusation by riyadh on monday that lebanon and hezbollah had declared war on the conservative gulf arab kingdom. riyadh says hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because hezbollah was calling the shots in his government.  saudi arabia considers hezbollah to be its enemy in conflicts across the middle east, including syria and yemen.    western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson warned other countries and groups against using lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the middle east, saying washington strongly backed lebanon s independence and respected hariri as a strong partner of the united states, still referring to him as prime minister.  there is no legitimate place or role in lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the lebanese state,  tillerson said in a statement released by the u.s. state department. tillerson told reporters on friday there was no indication that hariri was being held in saudi arabia against his will but that the united states was monitoring the situation. the french foreign minister said earlier on friday that he also believed hariri was a free man   a statement at odds with the later french foreign ministry comment that it wanted hariri to have  all his freedom of movement . hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from saudi arabia, saying he feared assassination and accusing iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world. two top lebanese government officials, a senior politician close to hariri and a fourth source told reuters on thursday that the lebanese authorities believe hariri is being held in saudi arabia.  nasrallah said saudi arabia was encouraging israel to attack lebanon. while an israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely, he said, it was unlikely partly because israel knew it would pay a very high price.  i warn them against any miscalculation or any step to exploit the situation,  he said.  saudi will fail in lebanon as it has failed on all fronts,  nasrallah said. riyadh has advised saudi citizens not to travel to lebanon, or if already there to leave as soon as possible. other gulf states have also issued travel warnings. those steps have raised concern that riyadh could take measures against the tiny arab state, which hosts 1.5 million syrian refugees. hariri s resignation is being widely seen as part of a saudi attempt to counter iran as its influence deepens in syria and iraq and as riyadh and its allies battle iranian allied houthi rebels in yemen. hariri s resignation unraveled a political deal among rival factions that made him prime minister and president michel aoun, a political ally of hezbollah, head of state last year. the coalition government included hezbollah, a heavily armed military and political organization. aoun told saudi arabia s envoy on friday that hariri must return to lebanon and the circumstances surrounding his resignation as prime minister while in saudi arabia were unacceptable, presidential sources said. an  international support group  of countries concerned about lebanon, which includes the united states, russia and france, appealed for lebanon  to continue to be shielded from tensions in the region . in a statement, they also welcomed aoun s call for hariri to return.    in comments to reuters, top lebanese druze politician jumblatt said lebanon did not deserve to be accused of declaring war on saudi arabia.  for decades we ve been friends,  he said.  we are a country that is squeezed between two antagonistic interests, between saudi arabia and iran,  he said.  the majority of lebanese are just paying the price ... lebanon can not afford to declare a war against anybody.  the saudi foreign minister accused hezbollah of a role in the launching of a ballistic missile at riyadh from yemen on saturday. saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman said iran s supply of rockets to militias in yemen was an act of  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war. nasrallah mocked the saudi accusation that iran and hezbollah were behind the firing of the missile from yemen, saying yemenis were capable of building their own missiles.

" japan s government approved a record military budget on friday but did not earmark enough extra money to stop a splurge on u.s. made ballistic missile defense kit from putting a squeeze on funding for an ambitious domestic jet fighter project. japan s defense outlays for the year starting april 1 will rise for a sixth straight year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($45.76 billion), according to a budget breakdown published by the government. the biggest ticket item is 137 billion yen to reinforce defenses against a possible north korean ballistic missile attack.  that includes purchases of a new longer range interceptor, the sm 3 block iia, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, upgrades for the patriot missile batteries that are the last line of defense against incoming warheads and preparations for the construction of two ground based aegis radar stations. japan will also spend 2.2 billion yen to begin acquiring medium range air launched cruise missiles able to strike sites in north korea in a bid to deter any potential attack by pyongyang, which continues to test ballistic missiles.  it is essential that we have the latest, most capable equipment to bolster our defenses,  japanese minister of defence intsunori onodera said after he and other cabinet members approved the new spending plan.  the latest rocket launched by the north on nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) before plunging into the sea of japan.   a spending spree on mostly u.s. made equipment means japan s defense planners are being forced to curtail domestic programs that would help local defense contractors such as mitsubishi heavy industries and kawasaki heavy industries maintain their military industrial base. that may force japan to curtail its long held ambition to build an advanced stealth fighter, dubbed the f 3. in november, u.s. president donald trump called on prime minister shinzo abe to buy more u.s. made weapons as his administration pushes washington s allies to contribute more to their joint defense. japan plans to allocate 279 billion yen of its next budget to buy defense equipment through the u.s. government s foreign military sales system, 15 percent more than the current budget and more than double the amount spent in year that ended march 31, 2015.  people who spoke to reuters in november said japan will delay a decision to develop the f 3, which is meant to counter military technology advances by china, putting on hold a project estimated to be worth more than $40 billion. the latest defense spending plans provide the first concrete public indication that pause is underway. a budget request submitted in august earmarked 7.4 billion yen for a new large jet engine test facility that japan s defense ministry will need to test a prototype f 3 engine. that item was not included in the budget approved on friday. a proposed 2.4 billion for other f 3 research was also trimmed to 1.6 billion yen.  money is being spent in other areas and this is a sign that the government sees the f 3 as a low priority,  a japanese defense ministry official said. he asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.

" the three parties exploring a possible coalition in germany face an early test of their willingness to compromise on thursday when they try to hammer out a common stance on deeply divisive immigration and asylum policy. german chancellor angela merkel is trying to patch together a tricky three way coalition after her party suffered bruising losses in a national election three weeks ago   losses that even some of her allies blame on her refugee policies. germany s demographic landscape changed overnight in 2015 with her decision, in the face of refugee flows on a scale not seen since world war two, to open the borders to over a million migrants fleeing war in the middle east and africa. while some hailed the move as a humanitarian act, it was less popular in her own conservative camp, where many blame her for the subsequent surge in the anti immigration alternative for germany party, which took seats from her bloc. within her conservative bloc, the bavarian christian social union (csu) is demanding a cap on refugee numbers, rejected by merkel as unconstitutional. to her left, the greens oppose what they see as a populist driven tightening of asylum rules. with parties far apart, christian lindner, leader of the pro business free democrats (fdp) warned that talks could rapidly descend into conflict with greens on the sensitive matter of allowing family members to join migrants in germany.  the csu s talk of an upper limit is empty,  lindner told der spiegel magazine.  but i have sympathy for the csu s calls for a change in immigration policy given the need for order,  he added, warning merkel against compromising with the greens.  once control has been re established, then we can be more open again on family reunification,  he said.  until then it must be strictly limited to cases of hardship and to the core family   parents and children.  in the first two round of coalition talks, the three parties defied expectations by finding substantial common ground on fiscal policy.  but politicians from all parties have said it could take months to clinch agreement on what would be germany s first three way coalition for decades.

" u.s. president donald trump will ask china to cut its financial links with north korea and to abide by u.n. sanctions when meeting with chinese president xi jinping in beijing, a senior white house official said on wednesday. trump arrived in beijing on wednesday afternoon from south korea for a two night stop in the chinese capital as part of his marathon asia tour. the u.s. president was undecided on whether to declare north korea a state sponsor of terrorism by the end of his trip, the official said, speaking to reporters on board air force one. trump believes any talks with the north would require reducing threats, ending provocations and movement toward denuclearization and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearisation, the official added.

" a dam in puerto rico weakened by heavy rains from hurricane maria was in danger of failing on sunday, posing a flood threat to thousands of homes downstream as the storm battered u.s. island territory struggled through a fifth day with virtually no electricity. some 70,000 people who inhabit a river valley below the guajataca dam in the northwestern corner of the island have been under evacuation orders since friday afternoon, when authorities first warned that the earthen structure was in danger of imminent collapse. the fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the pandemonium facing disaster relief authorities in the aftermath of maria, which has claimed at least 29 lives across the caribbean, according to officials and media reports.  puerto rico governor ricardo rossello personally urged residents of the area to heed evacuation orders after surveying damage to the dam on saturday, telling reporters that a fissure in the structure  has become a significant rupture.  the dam, which stands about 120 feet (37 meters) tall, was built in 1929 and supplies the surrounding region with hydropower, drinking water and irrigation supplies. the national weather service in san juan, the island s capital, extended a flash flood watch for communities along the rain swollen guajataca river below the dam through midday sunday. if the dam were to fail, flooding would be life threatening, the weather service warned.  stay away or be swept away,  it said. maria, the second major hurricane to savage the caribbean this month and the most powerful to strike puerto rico in nearly a century, carved a path of destruction through the island after plowing ashore early on wednesday.  arriving as a category 4 storm on the saffir simpson wind scale, with top winds of up to 155 mph (249.5 kph), maria ripped roofs from buildings, turned roads into gushing debris strewn rivers and knocked out power across the entire island, home to 3.4 million people.  we lost our house, it was completely flooded,  said  resident carmen gloria lamb, a resident near the rain swollen guajataca.  we lost everything; cars, clothes, everything.  puerto rico officials have officially confirmed 10 storm related fatalities on the island, and the hurricane was blamed for at least 19 other deaths across the caribbean, the bulk of them on the devastated island nation of dominica. severe flooding, structural damage to homes and the loss of all electricity, except from backup generators, were three of the most pressing problems facing puerto ricans, new york governor andrew cuomo, whose state is home to many of puerto rican descent, said during a tour of the island.  it s a terrible immediate situation that requires assistance from the federal government, not just financial assistance,  he said on cnn on saturday. even the island s medical facilities have been left in precarious shape, with many hospitals flooded, strewn with rubble and running critically low on diesel fuel needed to keep generators operating. evacuation to the u.s. mainland is the only option for some patients. signs of the strain on puerto ricans were evident throughout san juan, the capital. drivers had to wait up to seven hours at the few filling stations open on saturday, according to news reports. water rationing also began on saturday. signs posted throughout san juan s old town informed residents that service would return for two hours until further notice.  telephone service also was unreliable, with many of the island s cell towers damaged or destroyed. on sunday morning, the governor told reporters that officials would continue to clear roads and bridges blocked by the storm and that he would be joining a supply delivery mission to caguas, a small city in the mountains south of san juan.  the storm caused an estimated $45 billion of damage and lost economic activity across the caribbean, with at least $30 billion of that in puerto rico, said chuck watson, a disaster modeler at enki research in savannah, georgia.  maria, which was hundreds of miles (km) east of florida over the atlantic ocean on sunday, has been downgraded to a category 2 storm and was expected to weaken further as it moves north in the atlantic off the east coast over the next two days. maria hit puerto rico about two weeks after hurricane irma, one of the most powerful atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the caribbean and the united states. the two storms followed hurricane harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck texas in late august and caused flooding in houston.

" the liberty party that placed third in the first round of liberia s presidential elections on monday submitted a complaint to the elections commission (nec), calling for it to annul the result won by former soccer star george weah, the document showed. if the contents of the liberty party (lp) complaint, which was seen by reuters, are deemed valid, it could force a re run of what is expected to be the west african country s first democratic transfer of power since 1944. its candidate lawyer charles brumskine placed third after weah placed first and the ruling party s joseph boakai second. the complaint was filed by the presidential and vice presidential candidates as well as all representative candidates of the liberty party. international observers, including the carter center and the national democratic institute, said they did not see any major problems with the vote. in its complaint, the liberty party alleges various problems ranging from the late opening of polls to the absence of queue controllers but also included fraud allegations, including by nec officials.  nec officials were not immediately available outside of normal office hours.  in one case, the lp alleges that an nec officer had pre marked ballots in his possession. in another, the lp said an official misrepresented the number of ballots for the party s candidate.  these elections were characterized by gross irregularities and fraud, which undermined the integrity of the elections and deprived thousands of liberians of their constitutional right to vote,  the document said. the second round run off is scheduled for next month.

" u.s. health insurer unitedhealth group inc on tuesday said it would largely exit the obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing expectations for mounting losses from the program. unitedhealth is the largest u.s. health insurer and one of the biggest sellers of plans on the exchanges, which were created as part of president barack obama’s national healthcare law. unitedhealth sells these plans in 34 states this year, up from 25 states last year. “next year, we will remain in only a handful of states,” unitedhealth ceo stephen hemsley said in prepared remarks as part of the company’s first quarter earnings report.  the company warned investors late last year that it was losing money on the new plans and might exit the market. on tuesday, the company raised its 2016 expectation for losses on the exchanges by $125 million to $650 million. unitedhealth’s hemsley said that the shorter term, higher risk profile of the new members, as well as the smaller than expected enrollment, suggested unitedhealth could not offer plans on a sustained basis.  for the first quarter, united health’s profit was better than expected and unitedhealth shares rose 1.9 percent to $130.29 in early new york stock exchange trading.  other health insurers including aetna inc and anthem inc are also large players on the exchanges. in recent months they said they will continue to sell exchange plans.  the company has 795,000 customers from the exchanges, more than half of them new to unitedhealth, it said. it expects about 650,000 members by year end.  the government said in february that more than 12 million people had signed up for obamacare related insurance through healthcare.gov or a state based exchange as of jan. 31. previous government expectations had been for more than 20 million people. unitedhealth raised its expectations for 2016 profit, in part because of a more favorable tax rate that also helped it beat wall street expectations for the first quarter. lower sales and administrative costs and a decline in amortization of intangible assets also helped its first quarter results. on an adjusted basis the health insurer earned $1.81 per share, compared with wall street analyst expectations for earnings of $1.72 per share, according to thomsonreuters i/b/e/s. net profit rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.41 billion or $1.46 per share, a year earlier.  the company now expects 2016 adjusted net earnings of $7.75 $7.95 per share, up 15 cents per share from its previous estimate.

" u.s. president donald trump’s sudden decision to ban transgender  personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it. trump’s declaration, which came via early morning tweets on wednesday, appeared to pre empt an ongoing pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by reuters on thursday.     “i hope our commander in chief understands that we don’t transmit orders via twitter, and that he can’t, either,” one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it’s even possible.”      rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands.. the united states’ top military officer, marine general joseph dunford, told the armed forces on thursday there had been no change yet to pentagon policy on transgender personnel. dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed trump’s announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders. “i know there are questions about yesterday’s announcement on the transgender policy by the president,” dunford wrote. “there will be no modifications to the current policy until the president’s direction has been received by the secretary of defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance,” dunford said in the message, first reported by reuters. dunford then made the assurance that the military would “treat all of our personnel with respect.”  his message neither voiced support nor opposition to trump’s decision. one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the army, navy, marine corps and air force acknowledged that trump’s announcement on wednesday was “unexpected.” the defense department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. but mattis on june 30 approved a six month delay to allow for a review.  as a presidential candidate, trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.  his move on wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow republicans. the white house said trump had “extensive discussions with his national security team,” and that defense secretary jim mattis was informed after the president decided on tuesday to go ahead. trump cited “tremendous medical costs and disruption” as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual’s capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference. the army’s chief of staff, general mark milley, said on thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the army. “i will be candid. ... this is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean cut either way,” he said. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said implementation of  trump’s decision was still being worked out. separately, the trump administration on thursday told a u.s. appeals court in new york that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position democratic former president barack obama took. trump’s plan to ban transgender military service members has  unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue. trump’s tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.  but if the defense department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say. “there’s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,” said jon davidson, legal director for lgbt rights group lambda legal. it was also unclear whether it might go beyond active duty forces and apply to reservists. indiana national guard reservist cameron st. andrew, who  resigned from full time service after the november election, told reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status. “i try to be tough about it,” he said, but added: “it breaks your spirit down.” one active duty u.s. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted. “we’re scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from,” the officer said by phone.  “maybe the president is in step with some members of congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts.”

" a new, republican controlled u.s. congress convenes on tuesday eager to repeal major portions of president barack obama’s healthcare law and roll back environmental and financial industry regulations, but could quickly become embroiled in fights over president elect donald trump’s cabinet choices. despite his promise to unite a deeply divided country, trump will be sworn in on jan. 20 leading a republican party that early on will push legislation through congress without significant   or any   democratic support. according to a gallup poll released on monday, trump will take office with less than half of americans confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, use military force wisely or prevent major ethics lapses in his administration. leading democrats on monday warned of a fierce fight over obamacare, which is expected to have 13.8 million people enrolled in the program that aims to provide health insurance to economically disadvantaged people and to expand coverage for others. obama is scheduled to meet on wednesday with congressional democrats to discuss strategies for fending off republican attacks on obamacare. vice president elect mike pence will meet with his fellow house republicans the same day to rally them on repealing obamacare, politico reported. republicans in coming weeks will try to steer legislation through congress using procedures that would not require democratic cooperation. their bill, which has not been unveiled, is expected to repeal obamacare, but postpone the actions for two or three years while also maintaining some of the law’s provisions. “we’re going to fight as hard as ever to protect the aca (affordable care act), said representative steny hoyer, the house of representatives’ second ranking democrat. speaking to reporters, hoyer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi said they would launch an effort to mobilize grassroots support for obamacare by explaining how repeal would create a ripple effect hurting a majority of americans. for years, republicans have hammered away at obamacare, insisting it was unworkable and was hampering job growth. with control of congress and the white house, they will be in a position to enact a repeal bill. the senate will have more than legislation on its hands in the new year. it has the daunting task of debating and voting on the scores of appointees trump already has announced to head his cabinet departments and for other top jobs in the new administration. it also is expected to receive a supreme court nomination early on from trump, triggering a likely confirmation war. prominent senator john mccain has warned that rex tillerson, trump’s choice for secretary of state, will have to explain his relations with russian president vladimir putin, whom mccain has called a “thug and a murderer.” tillerson, who spent much his career at exxon mobil corp (xom.n), has been involved in business dealings in russia and opposed u.s. sanctions against russia for its incursion into crimea. meanwhile, democrats are expected to oppose republican jeff sessions to be attorney general, in part because of his opposition to immigration and past remarks that showed racial insensitivity. and given trump’s campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in washington of special interests, especially wall street influence, democrats are also poised to attack the nomination of steven mnuchin to be treasury secretary. mnuchin is a successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager who spent 17 years at goldman sachs group inc (gs.n). nevertheless, trump is expected to win approval of most, if not all, of his nominees. besides obamacare repeal, republicans also want to curtail or block regulations aimed at controlling industrial emissions that contribute to climate change and banking industry reforms enacted in the wake of the near collapse of wall street several years ago. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who waged bitter battles against obama over the past eight years, has warned his fellow republicans against overreaching following their nov. 8 election victories. in an interview with kentucky educational television on dec. 19, mcconnell said, “it’s certainly no time for hubris” and there is “not much i can do (legislatively) with republicans only in the u.s. senate.” while he repeatedly called for removing obamacare “root and branch,” mcconnell said in the interview that his top priorities for the new congress were dealing with “massive overregulation” that he said has been a brake on the u.s. economy and accomplishing tax code changes to stop companies from moving jobs offshore.

" new york attorney general eric schneiderman said on tuesday he had opened an inquiry into the donald j. trump foundation to ensure the republican presidential nominee’s charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. schneiderman, a supporter of trump’s democratic rival in the presidential race, hillary clinton, sued the real estate mogul and his now defunct trump university for fraud in 2013, seeking $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. in a cnn interview on tuesday, schneiderman said his office had now brought trump’s charitable foundation under scrutiny. “my interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of nonprofits in new york state. and we have been concerned that the trump foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,” the elected democratic official said. he added: “we have been looking into the trump foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws that govern charities in new york.” he did not elaborate on what wrongdoing trump’s nonprofit might have committed. trump campaign spokesman steven cheung dismissed schneiderman’s assertions as entirely motivated by presidential politics, calling the attorney general a “partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the clinton foundation for years.” cheung called schneiderman’s comments “nothing more than another left wing hit job designed to distract” attention from clinton’s recent missteps on the campaign trail. trump has accused clinton of being corrupted by donors to the clinton foundation global charity founded by her husband, former president bill clinton, while she was u.s. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. clinton has dismissed trump’s allegation as a political smear. there has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the state department while clinton headed the agency. schneiderman made his remarks when asked on cnn about calls from democrats in congress for a federal investigation of a $25,000 donation in 2013 from the trump foundation to a political committee supporting florida’s republican attorney general, pam bondi.  democrats have cited an associated press report that bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join new york state’s investigation into trump’s real estate training school in florida. according to the ap, bondi, who was seeking re election at the time, broke off the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived. bondi, who has endorsed trump, has called the ap report misleading.

" spanish and moroccan police have arrested five moroccans and one spaniard suspected of belonging to an islamist militant cell that simulated decapitations, the spanish interior ministry said on wednesday. the arrests mark the first big raids since a double islamist attack in catalonia in august that killed 16 people, most of whom were mown down by a van in barcelona. the cell was at an advanced stage of activity, the ministry said. it did not say whether those arrested were men or women. the group held secret night meetings at which they planned large scale attacks, and carried out physical training sessions in which they simulated cutting off victims  heads, the ministry said. five of the arrested were moroccan, one with spanish residence rights. one was spanish of moroccan heritage. one was arrested in the spanish north african enclave of melilla, and the rest in morocco. spanish police have arrested 199 people in the country accused of connections to militant groups since raising the security alert to one notch below the highest level in 2015.

" the european union said on thursday it had made its position on climate change clear and was not engaged in last minute lobbying of the trump administration to keep the united states aboard the paris climate accord. u.s. president donald trump is due to announce later on thursday if he will quit the global climate deal. the group of seven summit in italy on friday and saturday revealed a clear split between trump and the other leaders over honoring the 2015 agreement.  “i don’t think there was any need for more contacts since ... world leaders were together for two days at a summit in an idyllic place,” a commission spokesman said, referring to the venue in taormina, sicily. “this debate is well known, the position of europe is well known too.... so there you have it, the die is cast,” he said. an eu official said trump had not appeared persuaded of the merits of the paris accord, deeming it unlikely that he would change course. “but as we all know, he is unpredictable,” the official said.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan on tuesday sharply criticized republican presidential candidate donald trump’s twitter post depicting democratic rival hillary clinton against a backdrop of cash and a star of david, saying anti semitic images have “no place in a presidential campaign.” “candidates should know that,” ryan, the highest ranking elected republican, said in an interview with radio station wtmj in milwaukee, two days before trump was due to meet house and senate republicans in washington. “i really believe he’s got to clean up the way his new media works,” he said, in a reference to trump’s social media efforts. the presumptive republican nominee has frequently used twitter to skewer his opponents and push his proposals. the radio station posted audio from the interview on its website, and the wisconsin congressman’s office provided a transcript of the session. ryan’s comments came a day after trump defended the tweet, saying he had not meant the six pointed star to refer to the star of david, which is a symbol of judaism. rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriff’s badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a “plain star.” republican leaders were criticized in the u.s. media for not speaking out forcefully against the image attacking clinton, which appeared over the u.s. independence day holiday weekend. “if i had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this (trump) campaign, i’d have no time for anything else,” said ryan, who supports trump but has repeatedly spoken out against trump’s rhetoric, including his criticism of a mexican american judge. “my understanding is, this was done by staff not by he himself,” ryan said. “but more importantly, they’ve got clean this thing up.” trump is due to meet with house and senate republicans in washington on thursday. ryan did not say whether the tweet was likely to come up.  house republican leader kevin mccarthy told reporters that the meeting would mainly focus on the newly released republican agenda, which addresses six types of issue from poverty to tax reform. “but members will be free to talk about all different angles, and ideas, and probably some people will give their opinions and ideas on how to run the campaign,” mccarthy said. asked about his comfort level with trump, the california republican replied: “i always look for constant improvement.” ",0
" europe and africa have joint responsibility for making migration more humane and orderly so they can end horrifying abuses being committed against african migrants by people smugglers, european council president donald tusk said on wednesday. he was speaking at a two day africa european union summit that was meant to focus on development and investment in youth, but had inevitably been overshadowed by the migrant crisis. reports this month of white libyan slave traders selling black african migrants at markets in libya   a grim echo of the trans saharan slave trade in centuries past   have drawn worldwide horror. the outcry threatened to put migration to the top of the summit agenda and shine a light on a thorny issue for european leaders faced with a surge in far right, anti immigration parties at home.  it is clear that migration is a joint responsibility. it is in all our interests to have orderly migration that is more controlled, more humane and sustainable,  tusk said in his opening remarks.  the recent reports about the treatment of africans   especially young people   by smugglers and traffickers are horrifying,  he said, adding that 5,000 migrants had drowned in the mediterranean last year. soon after cnn aired grainy images from libya this month appearing to show migrants being sold as slaves, african governments began recalling diplomats from tripoli. protests erupted in france, senegal and benin. ivory coast president alassane ouattara called for libyan slave traders to be prosecuted by the international criminal court.  let s work together to bring more humane solutions to this migration crisis that taints relations between the north and the south,  said guinea s president, alpha conde, the chairman of the african union. libya has promised to investigate the reports, but many african citizens also blame european policies for abuses along the migrant trail.  the worst we can do is to start the blame game. what we need now are common solutions and stronger cooperation to save lives, protect people,  tusk said.  our common duty is to step up the fight against these unscrupulous criminals.   but european leaders   including german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron, who head the franco german axis at the heart of the eu   are hamstrung by electorates that are increasingly anti immigration. despite pressure at home, merkel on wednesday highlighted the need to create legal avenues for migration.  however, gunter nooke, her special envoy for africa, later told reuters that alone would not solve the problem.  there we talk about thousands, tens of thousands. but with (illegal) migration we talk about millions.   he added that no country is going to allow hundreds of thousands of students in from developing nations unless they can be sure most will go back within four years, which he said rarely happened. in a joint statement, the united nations, african union and european union announced the creation of a joint task force  to save and protect lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and in particular inside libya,  and to speed up returning migrants to countries of origin. european and african leaders met late on wednesday to discuss the reports of slavery in libya and the migrant crisis.  we must not only denounce it, we must act, by collectively attacking these smuggling networks,  macron, who has called the abuses in libya a crime against humanity, said at the meeting.   we are going to ... to carry out targeted sanctions.

" democratic front runner hillary clinton on sunday dismissed the notion of a contested nominating convention and said she was not preparing for such a scenario, after her rival for her party’s presidential nomination racked up another victory.  bernie sanders won the wyoming caucuses on saturday, his seventh victory over clinton in the last eight democratic nominating contests as the two gear up for a crucial matchup on april 19 in new york state. sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, is trying to chip away at clinton’s big lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the democratic nomination for the nov. 8 presidential election. he said on sunday he believed he could close the gap, and left the door open for a so called floor flight at the democratic national convention in philadelphia in july if neither has won an outright majority of delegates.  in that case, a system of multiple ballots takes place, governed by complex rules, with candidates hoping to persuade delegates to vote for them. asked on cnn if she were preparing for such a scenario, clinton said, “no, i intend to have the number of delegates that are required to be nominated.”    the former u.s. secretary of state said she was leading sanders by 2.5 million popular votes and in pledged delegates. “i feel good about the upcoming contests, and i expect to be the nominee,” she said. the specter of a contested convention, a relatively rare event in recent u.s. politics, looms much larger in the republican race. while front runner donald trump has amassed a delegate lead by winning many state contests, rival ted cruz has proved tenacious in pursuit of every last delegate available by other means. cruz’s campaign has worked hard in states where the delegate allocation process is more complex, such as colorado, where the u.s. senator from texas garnered 34 delegates on saturday. the trump campaign has complained about the nominating process, including in louisiana, where the new york billionaire trump won the vote but split the delegates equally with cruz. “it’s a crooked system,” trump said at a large rally in rochester, new york, on sunday before saying the process was broken in both major parties and expressing sympathy for sanders. “look at bernie: he wins and wins and wins.”  trump said he had warned the republican national committee there would be a “big problem” if he does not become the nominee. “we’re supposed to be a democracy. we’re supposed to be: you vote and it means something.” paul manafort, the veteran political strategist trump hired to oversee his delegate operation, accused the cruz campaign of bullying delegates into backing the senator, something the trump campaign planned to protest. “well, he’s threatening, you go to these county conventions, and you see the tactics, gestapo tactics, the scorched earth tactics,” manafort said on nbc’s ‘meet the press’. clinton was campaigning in baltimore on sunday, where she received the endorsement of u.s. representative elijah cummings ahead of maryland’s nominating contest on april 25, where another 95 delegates are at stake. the wyoming results did not change the delegate math for the democratic contenders. each won seven, since delegates are awarded proportionally based on caucus goers’ support. going into wyoming, clinton had more than half of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegates, those awarded based on the results of the state nominating contests.  but sanders said future contests in the west and on the east coast looked favorable to him, including new york, pennsylvania, california and oregon. “we believe that we have the momentum. we believe that the polling is showing that we’re closing the gap,” sanders said on sunday on abc’s “this week.” sanders sidestepped questions on whether he was prepared to take the nomination to a floor fight if clinton did not win the magic number of pledged delegates, but he left the possibility open. “if neither candidate ends up, you know, having the kind of votes they need, yes, i think there will be some discussion,” sanders said on cnn’s “state of the union.” an inquiry by the federal bureau of investigation into clinton’s use of a private email server in her chappaqua, new york, home for her work as secretary of state continues to cast legal uncertainty over her campaign. on sunday, her former boss, president barack obama, said he did not believe the arrangement harmed national security, despite more than 2,000 of her emails containing classified information, which the government bans from being handled outside secure, government controlled channels. “there’s classified and then there’s classified,” obama said in an interview with fox news. he also emphasized that the u.s. justice department would investigate impartially, without heed to politics.

" the systematic persecution of minority muslims is on the rise across myanmar and not confined to the northwestern state of rakhine, where recent violence has sent nearly 90,000 muslim rohingya fleeing, a myanmar rights group said on tuesday. the independent burma human rights network said that persecution was backed by the government, elements among the country s buddhist monks, and ultra nationalist civilian groups.  the transition to democracy has allowed popular prejudices to influence how the new government rules, and has amplified a dangerous narrative that casts muslims as an alien presence in buddhist majority burma,  the group said in a report. the report draws on more than 350 interviews in more than 46 towns and villages over an eight month period since march 2016. myanmar s government made no immediate response to the report. authorities deny discrimination and say security forces in rakhine are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists . besides rohingya muslims, the report also examines the wider picture of muslims of different ethnicities across myanmar following waves of communal violence in 2012 and 2013. the report says many muslims of all ethnicities have been refused national identification cards, while access to islamic places of worship has been blocked in some places. at least 21 villages around myanmar have declared themselves  no go zones  for muslims, backed by the authorities, it said. in rakhine state, the report highlighted growing segregation between buddhists and muslim communities and severe travel restriction for the muslim rohingyas, which limited their access to health care and education. tens of thousands of rohingya have fled into neighboring bangladesh since aug. 25, when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. the ensuing clashes and a military counter offensive have killed at least 400 people. the treatment of myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingya is the biggest challenge facing myanmar de facto leader aung san suu kyi, who critics say have not done enough to protect the muslim minority from persecution. the london based burma human rights network has been advocating among the international community for human rights in myanmar since 2012, it says on its website.

" connecticut lawmakers on thursday passed a two year $41.3 billion budget, nearly four months after it was due, that is expected to help capital city hartford avoid bankruptcy through state aid provisions. the budget for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 closes a $3.5 billion deficit over the two years, in part with tax and fee hikes on tobacco products, ride shares and low income working families. it also raids a host of funds   for everything from school bus seats to clean energy and tobacco cessation   for money that will be swept into the general fund. the state senate passed the nearly 900 page legislation early on thursday morning, with the house following suit later in the day. it was not immediately clear whether governor dannel malloy, a democrat who has said he will not seek a third term in office, would sign it. he vetoed a previous budget a month ago. in a statement, malloy spokeswoman kelly donnelly said the governor and his staff would analyze the bill but had “uncovered egregious problems” with a tax increase on hospitals that could knock the budget more than $1 billion dollars out of balance. raising hospital taxes would allow the state to get more federal medicaid reimbursement, with the tax revenues to be returned to the hospitals.  “if there’s a problem, we’ll fix it,” said house minority leader themis klarides, a republican, about the hospital tax in a televised press conference after the vote. the budget contains aid for hartford, which has said it could file for bankruptcy without extra funding to help close its own $50 million shortfall. that funding would come with strings attached in the form of a fiscal oversight board.     connecticut’s towns, schools and nonprofit service providers have grappled for months with growing uncertainty as they wait for state funding that helps them operate. when the fiscal year began on july 1 without a budget, malloy took control of spending through an executive order and enacted steep cuts.

" the u.s. labor department will delay implementation of its “fiduciary” rule by 60 days while it undertakes a review on whether the rule may hinder americans’ ability to get access to retirement investment advice, according to a filing in the federal register. the department’s rule, which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to act in the best interest of their customers, has been heavily criticized by republicans and wall street amid concerns it may make investment advice too costly. the delay of the rule, which was slated to take effect april 10, was prompted after president donald trump in february ordered the department to conduct the review on whether it should be revised or repealed. in order to delay the effective date, the department had to undertake a formal rule making process.  if the department ultimately decides on a repeal or change, it will need to undertake another rule making process in the future. in addition to the 60 day delay, the department also said that other regulatory requirements in the rule for firms to provide disclosures and written representations of compliance to investors will not be mandated until jan. 1, 2018. that date, the department added, is when it expects to complete its review. as of march 17, the department said it had received 15,000 comments in support of a delay, versus 178,000 comments opposing any delay.  despite the lop sided results, the department said a delay is justified because time is needed to complete the presidentially mandated review. rigid adherence to the original april 10 compliance deadline, the department said, could result in “an unduly chaotic transition to the new standards” and lead to “confusion, excessive costs, and needlessly restricted or reduced advisory services.” ",0
" a 72 year old swiss aid worker was freed by security forces early on wednesday more than a month after she was abducted in sudan s darfur region, officials said. margaret schenkel later flew back to the capital khartoum, but did not give details of her ordeal to waiting journalists. she was kidnapped on oct. 7 in the main city in north darfur region, el fasher, a hub for relief workers and u.n./african union peacekeepers. security forces launched an operation to free her from a rural area where she was being held outside the southern town of kutum, a spokesman for the regional government said. the leader and one member of the six man kidnapping gang had been arrested, sudan s foreign ministry spokesman, qarib al khidr, said. neither switzerland nor sudan paid a ransom, he added. khartoum has been at war with rebel groups in darfur since 2003, but much of the conflict has descended into banditry and gangs have kidnapped people for ransom. the swiss foreign ministry thanked sudan for its help in freeing schenkel. officials have not named her aid group.

" the u.s. congress could as soon as january start to dismantle president barack obama’s transformation of student loan rules by blocking freshly minted regulations designed to help students who say they were defrauded by for profit colleges. the new measures, which lay out loan relief procedures for the students, were issued by the department of education just days before the election. that is recent enough to allow the new republican led congress to disapprove them under a 1996 law called the congressional review act. it gives congress 60 legislative days to reverse regulations with a simple vote. republicans opposed the rule when it was proposed. lamar alexander, who chairs the senate committee on education, is considering introducing a resolution that would overturn the so called “borrower defense” rule, according to a spokeswoman.  even without a legislative reversal, president elect donald trump, who ran on an anti regulation platform and started his own for profit school, could instruct agencies to be more restrictive in how they interpret this rule and others aimed at easing student loan burdens. students who attended the now defunct trump university did not qualify for federal loans and are not eligible for loan relief. trump is facing civil lawsuits alleging fraud related to the school. after he was elected president, the stocks of for profit education companies rose. the borrower defense rule was inspired by the meltdown of corinthian colleges inc. in 2015, according to rohit chopra, who worked on the corinthian case at the consumer financial protection bureau and later moved to the department of education as a special adviser. in recent months, itt tech. inc. has also folded, leaving students adrift. by law, students at struggling technical and professional colleges are already allowed relief on federal loans, but the new rule creates a path for getting that relief. students can make a fraud claim to the education department and then apply for a refund of federal money they borrowed and then paid to the school. it is the payment on a fraud complaint   sometimes made in the absence of any actual conviction   that rankles republicans. they also dislike that the rule leaves students free to file class action suits against the schools, instead of arbitrating all disputes, said neal mccluskey, who follows higher education at the cato institute, a libertarian think tank.  it is not clear how many students   or how much in loans   would be affected by the new rule. the education department says it has already approved $250 million in relief to more than 15,000 applications from students who borrowed to attend corinthian. the projected 10 year federal government expenses associated with the rules total $16 billion.  congressional disapproval resolutions have failed in the past, because obama vetoed them. but in 2017, anti regulation republicans will control the house, the senate and the white house, and it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule.  education secretary john king defends the rule, saying his department went through a very thorough rule making process and addressed thousands of comments in the final version of the regulations. “the fact remains that students need some sort of process for student loan discharge in the case of a school closure or fraud,” said justin draeger, president of the national association of student financial aid administrators. “i’m not sure it’s as easy as simply voiding the entire regulation.” there are other higher education reforms a trump administration might undo, said elizabeth baylor, director for post secondary education at left leaning center for american progress. many borrower programs instituted under obama are at the education secretary’s discretion, and trump could appoint someone stricter on granting relief. a new secretary could also simply discontinue programs, she said.  in the same vein, steve gunderson, president of career education colleges and universities, says congress could block the new rule without a resolution, either through an upcoming budget bill or education legislation.

" self designed homes based on traditional iraqi architecture could be the solution to the drastic housing crisis facing mosul, where hundreds of thousands are expected to return following the end of three years of islamic state occupation. an award winning design would see returning residents create their own neighborhoods in modules that can grow and evolve to suit their needs.   the shape of the housing is completely up to the inhabitants,  said ania otlik, the winner of inaugural rifat chadirji prize, which challenged architects to find a practical and sustainable solution to the iraqi city s housing needs.  having one measure that fits all is almost impossible, especially when it comes to such a diverse society ... which varies in religion, culture, background (and) family size.  nearly 1 million civilians fled in the three years since islamic state militants took the city, which iraq declared liberated in july, according to the united nations. iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild mosul. otlik, a graduate of wroclaw university of science and technology in poland, researched traditional iraqi architectural designs, poring over sketches and schemes to create her housing plan. each dwelling is constructed around a central patio, providing outside space around which rooms and spaces can be arranged.  the plan of the house can be a little more open when the family decides it this way, or maybe another family is strictly islamic so they will build it in their own traditional way,  she told the thomson reuters foundation. building materials that are easy to source in the battle scarred city   such as rubble and mud   could be used for construction until more permanent replacements become available, she said. otlik drew inspiration from her native poland, whose capital warsaw was entirely rebuilt after it was razed by nazi troops during the second world war. other finalist designs featured garden bridges over the tigris river to provide housing and urban farms, and homes connected via a metro repurposed from a system of subterranean tunnels constructed by islamic state to aid its fighters.  it was not a problem finding a winner,  said ahmed al mallak, founding director of the independent tamayouz excellence award, which oversaw the competition. mallak hopes the winning designs will influence iraq s construction and housing minister anne nafi aussi and a number of planning officials who are scheduled to attend the formal prize giving ceremony in jordan s capital amman in december.

" u.s. president donald trump’s reelection campaign released its first television advertisement on sunday, a 30 second spot that attacks democrats and touts the accomplishments of his first seven months in office.  the ad’s release comes amid intense criticism of trump’s response to the events in charlottesville, virginia, where a planned rally by white supremacists led to violence that killed a counter protester. speaking on saturday from his golf resort in bedminster, new jersey, trump stopped short of calling the demonstrators “white supremacists” and instead criticized groups on “many sides.” even members of his own party said he had failed to adequately condemn those behind the violence. the new advertisement uses the same video clips, still images and font as one released earlier this year by america first policies, a political group that is able to secretly raise and spend unlimited sums of money.  trump’s campaign and america first policies are prohibited by law from coordinating with each other.  trump filed for reelection the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the november 2020 election. historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally. trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how much money it was spending on the ad, where it was running or why it decided to release it this weekend.     the ad says trump has created jobs and helped the stock market since taking office. “the president’s enemies don’t want him to succeed, but americans are saying, ‘let president trump do his job,’” the advertisement states.  trump continues to struggle with low approval numbers, and the television ad could be an attempt to bolster his support. his campaign has raised more than $12 million since the beginning of the year.  “this new campaign ad speaks directly to the american people and sets the record straight, reminding them that president donald trump will not stop fighting for them and will not allow anyone to stand in his way to deliver success for them,” campaign manager michael glassner said in a statement announcing the ad.

" america must work with all nations to build stronger economies, recognizing the inequalities that globalization can generate but refusing to give in to protectionism, u.s. president barack obama wrote in the economist on thursday. months before he leaves the white house in january, obama wrote that a certain anxiety over globalization had taken hold in the united states, not unlike the discontent leading to britain’s vote in june to leave the european union.  “the world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease,” the democratic president wrote. “so we have a choice   retreat into old, closed off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalization while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.” calling capitalism the greatest driver of prosperity the world has ever known, obama argued that trade had helped the u.s. economy much more than hurt it. his enthusiastic advocacy for trade runs counter to the stated policies of both his potential successors, who say many trade deals hurt u.s. workers. the trans pacific partnership trade deal championed by the president is opposed by republican presidential nominee donald trump and his democratic rival in the nov. 8 election, hillary clinton, whom obama has endorsed. obama listed four major structural challenges facing the united states   “boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy that’s primed for future growth.” trumpeting the achievements of his eight year presidency, led by preventing the 2007 2009 recession from turning into a depression, obama said a foundation was laid for a better future. “america must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,” he wrote.

" lebanon s foreign minister may not attend an arab league meeting in cairo on sunday and a final decision will be taken in the morning, a senior lebanese official told reuters on saturday. the official said foreign minister gebran bassil wanted to avoid an anticipated confrontation at the meeting with saudi arabia and its arab allies over the regional role of the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah. the emergency arab foreign ministers meeting is being convened at the request of saudi arabia with support from the uae, bahrain, and kuwait  to discuss means of confronting iranian intervention in the internal affairs of arab states,  the egyptian state news agency mena said. hezbollah is part of the lebanese government and a political ally of lebanese president michel aoun.  the sunni muslim monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite islamist iran are at loggerheads across the region, and tensions between them have recently escalated in both lebanon and yemen. lebanon was thrust to the forefront of the regional struggle when saad al hariri resigned as prime minister on nov. 4 in a surprise announcement from riyadh. aoun has accused saudi arabia of holding hariri hostage. senior lebanese politicians close to hariri have also said he had been held in saudi arabia against his will and coerced into resigning. saudi arabia and hariri both deny this. after french intervention, hariri flew to france overnight and met french president emmanuel macron in paris on saturday. hariri, speaking in paris, said he would clarify his position when he returns to beirut in the coming days. he said he would take part in lebanese independence day celebrations, which are scheduled for wednesday. hariri, long a political ally of saudi arabia, cited fear of assassination and accused iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world during his resignation speech.

" north carolina lawmakers adjourned for the year on friday night after leaving mostly intact a law restricting transgender bathroom access that has drawn condemnation and jeopardized the state’s efforts to host the nba all star game, officials said. the law passed in march made north carolina the first u.s. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. the national basketball association has said it could move its all star game out of charlotte, north carolina, and has cited concerns over the law’s effects on principles of inclusion and equal protection that league officials say they uphold.   a spokesman for the nba could not immediately be reached for comment. north carolina state representative chris sgro, a democrat who opposes the law, which is known as house bill 2, said he had hoped lawmakers would vote on friday on whether to repeal it. but they adjourned for the year without holding that vote, he said. “it probably means that we’re going to have to come back for a special session because we’re going to lose the all star game if we don’t,” sgro, who is executive director of the gay rights group equality north carolina, said in a phone interview. the nba all star game is scheduled for february 2017. president barack obama, business leaders, entertainers and some prominent politicians have criticized house bill 2, saying it is unfair to transgender people. state lawmakers on friday addressed one point of controversy over house bill 2 by restoring the right to sue for wrongful termination in state court on allegations of discrimination based on age, sex, race or other factors, officials said.  house bill 2 had removed that right and required such suits to be filed in federal court. the office of senate leader phil berger, a republican, said in a statement the change addressed concerns from the state’s governor and others.  but berger expressed continued support for house bill 2.    “protecting the safety and privacy of north carolina families by keeping grown men out of bathrooms, shower facilities and changing rooms with women and young girls has always been our primary objective,” berger said in a statement.  on thursday, an nba statement said no final decision had yet been made regarding the all star game.

" whether they like president donald trump or not, the u.s. veterans who gather at hoa’s place in danang show little concern that he avoided the war that marked their lives. trump flies into the vietnamese resort of danang on friday for a summit of asia pacific leaders, landing in a city that for many americans of his generation was their first sight of vietnam   and of war. “he’ll finally be able to put on his resume that he was in vietnam,” said david clark, 68, who is originally from akron, ohio and calls trump “a joke”. after serving in vietnam from 1968 to 1969 with the marine corps, he has now returned to help with projects to address the legacy of the war. trump never served in the military. he received five deferments during the vietnam war, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the new york times reported last year. the paper quoted trump as saying the bones spurs had been “temporary”.     “everyone i know tried to avoid it,” said draftee keith soukkala, sipping a beer at hoa’s place, a favored bar of veterans near danang’s “china beach”. “i stayed out as long as i could but i didn’t have any bone spurs,” said soukkala, who splits his time between vietnam and alaska and said he voted for trump. at 73, he is two years older than trump and recalls landing in danang to the humid heat and “a certain smell in the air” at the start of a 13 month tour with the marine corps dodging bombs hidden by the communist viet cong guerrillas. the seaside resort of danang has a special place in u.s. vietnamese history: it was here that the first u.s. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory. close to some of the heaviest fighting in central vietnam, danang had a big u.s. air base. china beach was a relaxation spot for u.s. soldiers back from combat. now, danang’s beachfront hotels draw tourists from around the world. gleaming office towers mark it out as one of vietnam’s most modern cities and one the communist government sought to showcase with the hosting of the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit which trump will attend. it’s also home to a community of u.s. veterans who returned to a country where a recent pew research survey showed the united states was viewed favorably by 84 percent of people. clark came back in 2013 for a year and is still in danang, busy with projects to destroy unexploded u.s. bombs and help families affected by the agent orange defoliant linked to illness and deformity. mark o’connor, 67, of sioux falls, south dakota, and once part of a helicopter assault team, visits as often as he can to provide bicycles to children in hill villages.      on this visit, though, he said he had come back in the hope of seeing trump   his support unaffected by the fact the president had not served in vietnam. “you know, more power to him,” he said. “you can’t feel bad about him and not feel bad about everyone who went to canada to avoid the draft.” ",0

" president donald trump will lay out a new u.s. national security strategy on monday based on his  america first  policy and will, among other items, make clear that china is a competitor, two senior u.s. officials said on saturday. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping while also demanding that beijing increase pressure on north korea over its nuclear program and to change trade practices to make them more favorable to the united states. the  national security strategy, to be rolled out in a speech by trump, should not be seen as an attempt to contain china but rather to offer a clear eyed look at the challenges china poses, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. the strategy, which was still being drafted, may also reverse democratic president barack obama s declaration in september 2016 that climate change is a threat to security, one official said. trump, a republican, is to lay out his foreign policy priorities, and will emphasize his commitment to  america first  policies such as building up the u.s. military, confronting islamist militants and realigning trade relationships to make the united states more competitive, the officials said.

" lebanon s saad al hariri can only prove he is free by returning home from saudi arabia where he went to announce his resignation as prime minister, lebanon s foreign minister said on tuesday. hariri s abrupt resignation on nov. 4 threw lebanon into crisis and put it center stage in a power struggle between sunni muslim saudi arabia and shi ite iran, whose ally hezbollah is powerful in lebanese politics. hariri said on tuesday he would return to lebanon within two days.  we hope to resolve this with the quick and immediate return of prime minister hariri to his country ... where he has the right to do what he wants,  foreign minister gebran bassil said after meeting french president emmanuel macron in paris.   the only thing that proves he is free is that he returns. right now he is in a situation that is ambiguous and not normal. we want to return to a normal situation,  he told reporters after the talks about how to end the crisis. france is a permanent member of the u.n. security council and lebanon s former colonial power. it is also penholder on lebanon for potential resolutions. there has been some talk that beirut could go to the u.n. if hariri did not return this week.  the president (michel aoun) spoke of a timeframe of one week from when this diplomatic campaign started to try to find a solution otherwise we would have to go to international laws,   he said. french officials say there is no u.n. action in the works at the moment. lebanese politicians and bankers say saudi arabia intends to do to their country what it did to qatar   corral arab allies into enforcing an economic blockade unless its demands are met. bassil said any saudi sanctions on his country would hurt syrian refugees and destabilize the region.   any (saudi) measures would not only be targeting lebanon and its stability, this would be a punishment for the region because any instability in lebanon would cause instability in the region,  he said.  the first to be affected in this would be syrians in lebanon,  he said, adding that sanctions could make it harder for lebanese population to absorb the syrian refugees in their midst. lebanon hosts some 1.5 million syrian refugees that have fled the neighboring civil war.  in the first such statement by a french official, prime minister edouard philippe on tuesday called on hariri to return to lebanon. foreign minister jean yves le drian is due in the saudi capital riyadh on wednesday to discuss the crisis and is expected to meet hariri.

" a jury did not convict washington state’s auditor on money laundering and tax evasion charges on tuesday in a blow to federal prosecutors who argued that the democrat had “spun a web of lies” to avoid paying taxes and defraud thousands of homeowners. the jury in tacoma also acquitted troy kelley, 51, of a single charge of making a false statement to irs agents in april 2013 after about four days of deliberation following more than five weeks of trial.  “this is the first step toward vindication for him,” angelo calfo, a defense attorney for kelley, said by telephone.  the criminal allegations against kelley focus on his former document tracking business for title companies during real estate sales and refinancing transactions in which he is accused of pocketing roughly $3 million in fees that should have been returned to borrowers from at least 2003 to 2008. a grand jury indicted kelley, a democrat elected in 2012, a year ago for his alleged scheme to keep stolen money and hide it from both the internal revenue service and those due a refund for home purchases or mortgage refinancings.  among the charges kelley faced was one count of possession and concealment of stolen property related to processing fees that should have been returned to borrowers.  he also faced charges of failing to pay federal taxes, obstructing related irs collections, money laundering, attempted obstruction of a civil lawsuit, and filing false income tax returns. it was not immediately clear what would happen with the remaining charges, calfo said. federal prosecutors could seek to re try the case, or the judge could grant kelley’s motion to dismiss the charges, he said. after a grand jury indicted kelley last year, u.s. attorney annette hayes said that he “spun a web of lies in an effort to avoid paying his taxes and keep more than a million dollars that he knew did not belong to him, but instead should have been returned to thousands of homeowners across this state.” hayes said in a statement on tuesday that her office “will thoroughly review the counts that the jury deadlocked on before making a decision about our next steps in this case.” a judge blocked a recall effort as kelley fought the charges and he took a leave of absence to prepare his defense. washington state governor jay inslee, a fellow democrat, has called for kelley’s resignation.

" henry paulson, a republican who was u.s. treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, on friday called a donald trump presidency “unthinkable” and said he will vote for democrat hillary clinton. paulson joins a growing list of establishment republicans who say they will not cast a ballot in the nov. 8 election for trump, the party’s presumptive nominee and a political neophyte whose populist rhetoric runs counter to many long held republican principles. “when it comes to the presidency, i will not vote for donald trump,” paulson, who was chief executive of goldman sachs before becoming treasury chief under republican president george w. bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the washington post. “i’ll be voting for hillary clinton, with the hope that she can bring americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world,” he said. paulson accused trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking “imprudent risk” and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail. he also took aim at trump’s opposition to trade agreements, which paulson said have created u.s. jobs and fostered innovation and competitiveness. “simply put, a trump presidency is unthinkable,” paulson said. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. brent scowcroft, a national security adviser to two republican presidents, endorsed clinton on wednesday, and richard armitage, a deputy secretary of state under george w. bush, said last week he would support her. paulson, who helped steer a $700 billion bailout of the financial system through congress during the financial meltdown, said trump is a “phony” who is unfit to be president. “i can’t help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical,” he said.

" hoping a thaw in relations with china will reopen opportunities after a diplomatic spat earlier this year cost many of them business, some 300 south korean executives joined president moon jae in for the start of his four day trip to china on wednesday. the delegation was the largest to accompany a south korean leader abroad, and reflected the value the firms placed on mending ties with their country s biggest trading partner. trade and business exchanges between the two countries froze earlier this year after south korea deployed u.s. made terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) anti missile system regardless of vehement objections from beijing.  among those who traveled were executives from some of the firms hit hardest by the backlash, including lotte group and cosmetics and entertainment firms such as amorepacific and s.m. entertainment. addressing around 500 chinese and south korean businessmen at a forum in beijing, moon stressed the need to  build a systemic foundation for a stable economic cooperation . moon said he expects to sign a memorandum with president xi jinping at a summit on thursday, a step toward follow up negotiations of the south korea china free trade agreement (fta) concerning services and investments.  this is expected to expand the entry of both countries  companies into service industries, and revitalize mutual investments,  he said.  the thaad disagreement knocked about 0.4 percentage points off expected economic growth in south korea this year and resulted in lost revenues of around $6.5 billion from chinese tourists in the first nine months of the year, as the number of  visitors fell by half. anti south korean sentiment also battered firms  sales of  entertainment, cosmetics and cars in china.  multiple officials from south korea s largest companies told reuters they hoped that moon s visit to china would mark the next step toward improving ties after the two governments reached an initial agreement in late october to move past the dispute.  still, they were doubtful whether a sudden turnaround in business relations would be achieved over the coming days.  if you look at earlier cases, it takes several, gradual steps for unspoken reprisals to be eased,  said an official from a korean firm accompanying moon who declined to be identified as the matter was sensitive.   we re hoping this is a key step.  reuters spoke to around 20 of the south korean firms represented in the delegation, and none had any fresh investment or business deal announcements planned. instead, an official at game developer wemade entertainment co ltd, whose ceo attended the forum, said executives would be looking to reopen dialogue with chinese counterparts.   rather than having a specific agenda, we are hoping for a space to discuss various matters,  the official said. in late november, china allowed travel agencies in beijing and shandong to resume some sales of group tours to south korea, but tour agencies were told not to include south korean retail to chemicals giant lotte group in travel packages.  lotte, which provided the land where the thaad system was installed, was hardest hit in the diplomatic standoff.  its chain of hypermarkets and supermarkets in china were largely shuttered, and it is expected to sell the stores for a fraction of what it invested. the conglomerate previously said it planned to sell the stores by the end of this year, but the talks have been in  a stalemate,  a lotte group official said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivities.  still, the official hoped the summit would ease the way for the planned sales of hypermarkets in china and lead to a full lifting of group tour bans.  we have big hopes about the summit,  the official said.

" republican donald trump had one last chance at a nationally televised debate to reach out to the undecided voters he badly needs to keep his presidential campaign viable.  he passed on the opportunity. instead, he chose on wednesday to stay with the strategy he has employed during recent weeks: pump up his hard core supporters and hope that’s enough to win.  he suggested he might not accept the election result if his democratic opponent hillary clinton wins on nov. 8, called her a “nasty woman,” and repeated hard line conservative positions on issues such as abortion and immigration.  while that kind of rhetoric was catnip to his passionate, anti establishment base, it is unlikely to have appealed to independent voters and women who have yet to choose a candidate. “when you’re trailing in the polls, you don’t need a headline the next morning saying that you’re not going to accept the election results,” said ford o’connell, a republican strategist who supports trump. with less than three weeks left in the race, trump is behind clinton in most battleground states and is underperforming in almost every demographic voter group compared to the republican nominee, mitt romney, four years ago. party strategists had said before the debate that he needed to use the event to draw in voters beyond his hard core supporters.  trump didn’t listen or perhaps didn’t care. his debate was a continuation of his apparent strategy to ensure his most fervent supporters show up on election day, while betting that his attacks on clinton’s character and truthfulness will discourage voting by already skeptical young and liberal democrats. but experts who study voter behavior warned that his attacks on clinton may backfire, saying he may instead awaken democratic voters who have so far been uninspired by clinton. “the risk he faces by engaging in a scorched earth policy is that he activates people rather than turning them off,” said michael mcdonald, who runs the u.s. election project at the university of florida. mcdonald, who tracks early voting returns and absentee ballot requests, said he is seeing larger than expected surges of support for clinton in southeastern states such as virginia, north carolina, and florida. the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project, which uses a massive online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that clinton has a 95 percent chance of winning the election by about 118 votes in the electoral college if it were held today. it is against this backdrop that trump has apparently decided to double down on energizing his base rather than broadening it. but the poll results cast doubt on the wisdom of that strategy. if trump’s core white, male, working class supporters vote at high rates, as expected, that likely won’t be enough to win. trump, for example, already does well with white men who are at retirement age. nine out of 10 of them are already expected to vote, according to the polling results, so, there is little room to squeeze out more votes. voting rights activists have accused trump of trying to suppress voter turnout by claiming, without evidence, that the election has been rigged against him. he has also said his supporters need to monitor polling stations to ensure a fair vote, which the activists decry as an act of intimidation.  should trump’s comments succeed in discouraging some democratic voters from turning out, that may also not be enough to help him secure the white house. he still loses under what could be considered a dream scenario for the republican nominee: white men show up in greater numbers than expected, while turnout among racial minorities is lower than expected. in this scenario, the states of the nation project estimates that trump would win the battleground states of ohio and north carolina, and he would have a shot at winning pennsylvania, wisconsin and colorado. even then, clinton would still have an 82 percent chance of winning the election. there’s yet another risk to trump’s strategy. by claiming the election is rigged, he could be unintentionally signaling to his supporters that voting no longer matters. michael sopko, 63, a mortgage broker from denver and a trump backer, said before the debate that he sees his vote as pointless. “they have already been corrupted,” he said of voting machines, speaking ahead of a trump rally in colorado springs. “i think the results are already cast.” ",0
" the supreme court on tuesday refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the u.s. constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment filed by a louisiana man convicted of fatally shooting his pregnant former girlfriend. two of the eight justices, liberals stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg, said they would have accepted the case, repeating concerns about the death penalty’s constitutionality they raised in a different case last year. the justices, who have sharply disagreed among themselves over capital punishment, declined to consider the appeal brought by lamondre tucker, who was sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of 18 year old tavia sills in shreveport. sills, nearly five months pregnant, was shot three times and her body was dumped in a pond. tucker, who is black, had argued in part that black males had an increased likelihood of being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in louisiana’s caddo parish due to endemic racism. at the time of tucker’s conviction, a confederate flag, symbol of the pro slavery southern states that lost the u.s. civil war that ended in 1865, flew outside the county courthouse, his lawyers said in court filings. breyer wrote that tucker “may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely geography.” “one could reasonably believe that if tucker had committed the same crime just across the red river in, say, bossier parish, he would not now be on death row,” breyer said. breyer’s comments echoed similar remarks he made in june 2015 when the court upheld oklahoma’s lethal injection procedures.  the shorthanded court has steered clear of taking major cases since the february death of justice antonin scalia, but even at full strength may not have accepted this one. there is no indication the court is any closer to taking a case that would challenge the death penalty directly, with the court’s two other liberals, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, not joining breyer’s opinion. four votes are needed for the justices to hear a case.  the pregnant sills had told tucker she believed he was the father. later testing showed tucker, 18 at the time of the murder, was not the father. the fetus did not survive. the supreme court left in place a september 2015 louisiana supreme court ruling that rejected tucker’s legal arguments and upheld his conviction and death sentence. in the united states, 31 states have the death penalty and 19 do not.

" israel shot down a pilotless plane over the golan heights on tuesday and said it was probably an iranian built aircraft on a  reconnaissance mission for the lebanese hezbollah militant group along israel s frontier with syria. the incident came hours before prime minister benjamin netanyahu was due to address the u.n. general assembly and cite israeli concerns about an entrenchment in syria of iranian and hezbollah forces that have been helping damascus beat back islamist led rebels. the drone was launched from an air base near damascus and was downed with a patriot interceptor missile over the golan demilitarized zone that has separated israeli and syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war, the military said.   as we understand, it was on a reconnaissance mission along the border and the golan heights on behalf of hezbollah,  a military spokesman, lieutenant colonel jonathan conricus, told reporters.  our intelligence suggests it was ... iranian made.  asked whether the drone might have been armed, conricus said that information was not yet available. he said israeli warplanes had also been scrambled. officials from syria, hezbollah and iran had no immediate comment on the incident. the golan, which israel captured from syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the syrian civil war. israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross border attacks.  our message is: the idf (israel defence forces) will not allow any violation of israeli sovereignty and we will not allow iranian forces, hezbollah, islamic jihad or shi ite militias of any kind to approach the israeli borders,  conricus said.

" senior german politicians on wednesday accused u.s. president donald trump of trivializing violence by white supremacists in virginia and called for a clear rejection of their ideology. governments could only win the fight against hatred, racism and anti semitism by rejecting such ideology and the willingness to use violence, said martin schulz, the center left candidate for chancellor, adding that this applies to germany and the united states. “the trivialization of nazi violence by the confused utterances of donald trump is highly dangerous,” said schulz, leader of the social democrats (spd). “we should not tolerate the monstrosities coming out of the president’s mouth,” he told the rnd newspaper group in an interview. republican leaders criticized trump for saying leftist counter protesters were also to blame for violence last saturday in charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. his comments won praise from white far right groups. schulz is the main challenger to chancellor angela merkel at a sept. 24 election. the spd, junior partner in merkel’s grand coalition, trails merkel’s conservatives in polls. schulz’s comments were echoed by justice minister heiko maas, another senior member of the spd. “it is unbearable how trump is now glossing over the violence of the right wing hordes from charlottesville,” maas said in a statement, reflecting concern across the german political spectrum about the trump presidency. “no one should trivialize anti semitism and racism by neo nazis,” said maas, senior member of the co governing spd. schulz and maas are the highest ranking german politicians to criticize trump’s rhetoric about the violence. the country has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to adolf hitler and the nazis, who ruled from 1933 until their defeat in 1945.  merkel told broadcaster phoenix on monday that clear and forceful action was required to combat right wing extremism, noting that germans had also seen a rise in anti semitism and had “quite a lot to do at home ourselves”. trump has come under increasing pressure over his stance on the violence, with many members of his own republican party and u.s. business executives distancing themselves from him. trump on tuesday said his original reaction was based on facts he had at the time and said both sides were to blame. the violence erupted during a protest by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of robert e. lee, commander of the pro slavery confederate army during the american civil war. protesters and counter protesters clashed in scattered street brawls before a car ploughed into the rally’s opponents, killing one woman and injuring 19 other people.

" if mike pence had any doubts about what life would be like on the 2016 republican presidential ticket with donald trump, the past week will have erased them: he is the damage control guy. the indiana governor who swore off political mudslinging years ago heard trump call democratic rival hillary clinton “the devil” and watched him fan the flames of a feud with the parents of a muslim soldier who died saving u.s. troops in iraq. unlike many vice presidential running mates, the mild mannered pence was not tapped as the attack dog in the nov. 8  presidential election. trump has that part down pat. pence’s job is harder: softening trump’s rough edges and limiting the fallout from what many republicans see as the nominee’s self inflicted wounds. a week ago, for example, pence rowed back on trump’s blacklist of some media outlets, saying the campaign is discussing changing course. last sunday, as trump’s dispute with the parents of slain u.s. army captain humayun khan boiled over, pence issued a statement praising the soldier as an “american hero” and saying that his family “should be cherished by every american.”     on wednesday, pence offered his own endorsement to house of representatives speaker paul ryan, the top u.s. elected republican, after trump infuriated many party leaders by declining to endorse ryan in his re election bid. pence, who swore off negative campaigning after losing a vituperative congressional race in 1990, eschews name calling. trump, by contrast, delights in using monikers such as “crooked hillary” and “the devil” to describe clinton. trump has made clear he values pence, telling a rally on thursday in portland, maine, that he and his running mate have a “great relationship.” but pence must walk a fine line. even as he defuses trump’s verbal bombs, pence must be careful to show he knows who is boss. he also has to stick to his own principles while not appearing to be trying to undermine the man who chose him as his no. 2. should trump win, pence, a former congressman, could serve as a conduit to the u.s. congress. but if trump loses, pence could emerge as a possible white house contender for 2020. republican strategist charlie black said pence has shown some political deftness. “he should have expected he would do some of this and provide more of the even tempered, articulate, measured responses,” black said. but republican strategist ryan williams said pence is in an “impossible spot” and said that trump’s missteps could cast a shadow over his running mate’s political future.     “mike pence is a good republican but unfortunately he will be associated with the controversies that have ensnared the trump pence ticket and will be tied to whatever the consequences of this election are,”  williams said.     trump’s off the cuff insults and controversial proposals, such as a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and a plan to build a wall along the mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, have made many in the party establishment uneasy. the republican nominee’s feud with the khan family made for an awkward moment for pence at a campaign event in carson city, nevada. a military mother asked pence how could he tolerate trump’s disrespect for the armed forces, which prompted boos. pence admonished the crowd to tone it down. “folks, that’s what freedom looks like and that’s what freedom sounds like,” he said before calling humayun khan an american hero. pence was asked on thursday by an 11 year old boy at a north carolina rally if his role was “softening up” trump’s policies and words. pence replied that he and trump were “shoulder to shoulder” in the campaign. christopher devine, co author of the book “the vp advantage” and an assistant political science professor at the university of dayton in ohio, said that if trump loses the november election, pence may try to position himself as a conservative bridge between trump supporters and traditional republicans. that may be an added reason for pence’s cautious approach. “he has to be very careful about how he handles the defense of donald trump,” devine said.

" president barack obama said on wednesday he hoped “cooler heads will prevail” and that the republican led senate will act on his u.s. supreme court nominee but top republicans dug in their heels, defending their refusal to consider anyone obama picks. obama has narrowed to five his list of candidates to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. obama’s nominee could tip the nine member court to the left for the first time in decades. the republicans who control the senate have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up or down vote on anyone obama picks, saying the choice should belong to the next president who takes office in january after the nov. 8 presidential election. “my hope is that cooler heads will prevail and people will reflect on what’s at stake here once a nomination is made,” obama said at a news conference with canadian prime minister justin trudeau. the white house is interviewing five candidates, federal judges sri srinivasan, jane kelly, ketanji brown jackson, paul watford and merrick garland, according to a source familiar with the process. senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley, whose panel handles supreme court nominations, offered a lengthy defense of the senate republicans’ stance. grassley accused democrats of a “charade” with feigned outrage over the republican refusal to consider obama’s nominee simply to “score as many political points as possible.” “regardless of what some are willing to admit publicly, everybody knows any nominee submitted in the middle of this presidential campaign isn’t getting confirmed. everybody. the white house knows it. senate democrats know it. republicans know it. even the press knows it,” grassley told a committee hearing. under the u.s. constitution, the president selects a supreme court nominee and the senate confirms or rejects the nominee. “i’m going to do my job,” obama said, promising an “eminently qualified” nominee. “and it will then be up to senate republicans to decide whether they want to follow the constitution and abide by the rules of fair play that ultimately undergird our democracy and that ensure that the supreme court does not just become one more extension of our polarized politics,” obama said.  denis mcdonough, obama’s chief of staff, and other presidential aides met with judiciary committee democrats at the white house on the nomination. afterward, the democratic senators predicted republicans would buckle under public pressure and drop their “obstruction” once obama names his nominee. “we are optimistic that, soon enough, not only will the president nominate, but our republican colleagues will see the light,” said u.s. senator chuck schumer, forecasting that obama’s nominee will be confirmed with bipartisan support. separately, one republican senator indicated senate republicans would act on a nominee if they had a republican president. “if a conservative president’s replacing a conservative justice, there’s a little more accommodation to it,” wisconsin’s ron johnson told a radio interviewer. “president obama’s nominee would flip the court from a 5 4 conservative to a 5 4 liberal controlled court. and that’s the concern,” johnson added. the grassley kelly connection grassley in 2013 spoke in favor of kelly’s nomination to the st. louis based u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit. she was confirmed by a 96 0 senate vote. kelly, an obama classmate at harvard law school, is based in iowa and previously served as a federal public defender there. the iowa senator rejected any notion he could be persuaded to drop his opposition if obama were to nominate a candidate previously confirmed by him and other republicans. he denounced the idea that the white house selection process was “guided by the raw political calculation of what they think will exert the most political pressure on me.” choosing someone like kelly from iowa would be an “obvious political ploy” that would fail, grassley added. senator orrin hatch, another judiciary committee republican, said in an interview that garland, whose previous nomination to the appellate court he backed, is “a fine man” who would be “a moderate choice” for the high court.  but hatch said he opposed acting even on garland. “it isn’t a question about the person in my opinion. it’s a question about the timing ... and the atmosphere that we have around here, which is poisonous,” hatch said. senate democratic leader harry reid delivered his latest attack on grassley, saying on the senate floor that it was “a little strange, a little odd” that grassley would not hold hearings even for kelly, considering his past support. iowa’s tom miller, a democrat, was among a group of attorneys general from 19 states, the district of columbia and puerto rico who sent a letter to grassley and other senate leaders urging them to act promptly on obama’s nominee.

" presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton has taken more money from employees of america’s 15 biggest pharmaceuticals companies than all of the republicans who attempted a run for the white house this year combined, according to campaign finance disclosures. the donations, which were nearly double those accepted by democratic rival bernie sanders, came even as the former senator and secretary of state vowed to curb price gouging in the industry if elected. clinton’s campaign took nearly $240,000 from employees of the industry between its launch and the end of april, compared with just under $168,000 for all of the republicans together, including around $1,700 for presumptive republican nominee donald trump, according to the filings.  the money, a drop in the bucket of clinton’s nearly $190 million in overall individual contributions, has tended to come from people in top jobs: 54 percent of the donors list their position as executive, director, manager or lawyer. donors and company officials contacted by reuters declined to comment on the contributions. industry insiders say the sector may be drawn to clinton for a few reasons: she has a good chance of winning against trump in november, her policies are relatively transparent and predictable, and she’s more supportive of international trade than rivals. many of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies are also headquartered in areas of the country that are more heavily populated by liberals, like new jersey and new york – another potential reason for the clinton heavy employee donations. “(trade) is, in particular, an issue for the pharmaceutical industry. they all operate trans nationally,” said dan mendelson, president of avalere health, a consulting firm that works with companies across the health sector. he added: “we have very limited ability to predict what would happen in a trump administration. we don’t know the people, we don’t have a lot to go on.” trump, who largely self funded his primary bid, only recently began soliciting donations for the general election, meaning his contributions from supporters in all industries are likely to rise in the coming months. clinton tapped into widespread public frustration over soaring health costs this winter when she outlined a plan to curb drug price hikes and singled out pharmaceuticals company valeant, saying she would “go after them” if elected. trump’s campaign seized on clinton’s donations from the industry as proof that she would be unlikely to follow through.  “hillary clinton will be totally controlled by the special interests,” trump spokeswoman hope hicks said. clinton has rejected the idea. “hillary clinton has spent her career fighting to crack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable,” spokesman josh schwerin said.  clinton’s donations from drug companies have grown since the last time she ran, in 2008, but fall far short of her rival in that race, president barack obama, who took in more than $500,000 in contributions from employees of pharmaceutical companies during the equivalent period of time. clinton’s total in this race so far, however, beats the combined take in the 2012 election of obama and republican nominee mitt romney from employees of the industry of $170,000, according to the filings.

" european union leaders said they agreed to stick together in dealing with donald trump, but at their first summit since he took office they were at odds on how far to confront or engage with the new u.s. president. trump and his policies, from questioning the value of nato and free trade to banning muslim refugees, came up repeatedly in discussions in malta on external “challenges” facing the union. british prime minister theresa may, about to lead her country out of the eu, briefed peers on her visit to washington last week and assured them trump was committed to cooperating in their defense — just as britain would also be after brexit. francois hollande, the outgoing socialist president of france, led criticism of trump, calling it “unacceptable” for him to applaud brexit and forecast the break up of the eu. in thinly veiled rebukes to may and some eastern states, he warned of trying to cut their own transatlantic deals. “a lot of countries should think of their future first of all in the european union rather than imagining i don’t what kind of bilateral relationship with the united states,” he said. lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite, who like many in the east is alarmed by trump’s conciliatory noises to moscow, poured cold water on may’s suggestion britain could be a link to washington. europe did not need a “bridge”, she was quoted as saying, because it could communicate with trump on twitter. but her polish neighbor, beata szydlo, reserved her main  criticisms for her predecessor as prime minister, eu summit chair donald tusk, who described trump this week as a “threat” to the eu, along with russia, china and militant islam.  “european politicians trying to build this sense of fear ... are making a mistake,” said szydlo, whose government, like trump, has spoken out against muslim immigration. “one cannot be confrontational in our relations with the united states.” stressing the need for unity, the bloc’s dominant leader, german chancellor angela merkel, said europeans still had common ground with the united states in many areas, while not sharing trump’s scepticism about many international institutions. “we have again made very clear our common values and our faith in multilateralism,” she told a news conference.  the union would, she said, push for free trade deals with more nations as trump pulls back. but cooperation with the united states against militant threats would continue, she said. one eu diplomat said france was clearly pushing to use the trump presidency to rally europeans behind a policy of greater distance from washington and turning to the eu, rather than nato, for their security.  “the germans are much more cautious,” the diplomat said. “there is a clear issue to be decided: whether we seek common ground to engage with the united states, or turn our backs.” summit host joseph muscat, the maltese prime minister, chose to emphasize balance in summing up the discussions, speaking of “concern” at trump’s policy but “no sense of anti americanism”. “there was a sense that we need to engage with the u.s. just the same,” muscat said. “but we need to show that we cannot stay silent where there are principles involved.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump on friday questioned facebook inc s (fb.o) decision to overhaul how it handles paid political advertisements amid investigations into alleged russian interference in u.s. elections.  the russia hoax continues, now it s ads on facebook,  trump wrote on twitter.  what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary,  referring to hillary clinton, his rival in the 2016 presidential campaign.  earlier this month, facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to congress but said on thursday it would do so, making a concession to u.s. lawmakers who have threatened to regulate the world s largest social network over ads that run during election campaigns. chief executive mark zuckerberg said facebook, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on facebook, no matter whom they target. facebook also will demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under u.s. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media. zuckerberg said on thursday the changes would help address concerns that governments including russia are using facebook ads to meddle in other countries  elections. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia engaged in cyber attacks to sway the 2016 election against democrat hillary clinton in favor of trump. u.s. congressional investigators and a special counsel are investigating the matter. moscow has denied any interference. while trump dismissed the advertisement controversy, his secretary of state, rex tillerson, expressed concern.  well, i think all of these social media providers are faced with many challenges,  tillerson said on abc s  good morning america,  pointing to their use by militant groups around the world as well as in election campaigns.   but they also have responsibilities,  he said.  and i think they re going to have to think carefully about their responsibilities in this regard.  u.s. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.

" families of sept. 11 victims and others who may seek to sue foreign governments accused of supporting terrorism in the united states still face significant legal hurdles, despite a boost from passage of a law allowing such cases to proceed.  the new justice against sponsors of terrorism act, or jasta, grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u.s. soil.  passage of the law over a presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade ago against saudi arabia in new york federal court. still, it will be hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism, said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law, who expected drawn out legal wrangling. “we may find that at the end of the day, after years of litigation, that the link is not sufficiently established even for saudi arabia,” said curtis bradley, a law professor at duke university.  the law says plaintiffs must show the foreign state “knowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources” to designated terrorist groups, not that the countries were simply negligent or looked the other way.  congress on wednesday overwhelming voted to pass the law, overturning president barack obama’s veto. before the law, american victims of terrorist acts could only sue countries designated by the u.s. state department as state sponsors of terrorism, currently iran, syria and sudan. now, any country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known terrorists that carry out attacks on u.s. soil.  existing tort law requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a “substantial factor” in the victims’ injuries, a high bar, said jimmy gurule an expert in international criminal law at the university of notre dame.    this could be challenging in the sept. 11 case since an independent commission on the 2001 attacks did not find sufficient evidence of saudi involvement. al qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and most of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals.  “we have a high degree of confidence we can meet that burden. the saudis think we can’t,” said jack quinn, co counsel for more than 2,000 family members of sept. 11 victims.  the families sued saudi arabia in 2003, seeking to hold the country responsible. the proceedings have been stalled on the question of saudi arabia’s immunity quinn said the plaintiffs will now ask the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals to reconsider the issue in light of the new law.  if the court says the case can move forward, both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions of witnesses and experts.  “we will next attempt to complete the development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the basis of that, let the chips fall as they may,” said quinn.   but even under the new law, the white house can still request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits. the law allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if the united states says it “is engaged in good faith discussions” with the country to resolve the claims.  the stay provision and other changes were added to address concerns raised by the white house, saudi arabia and companies like general electric and dow chemical co. obama is likely to request such a stay, said bradley. stephen vladeck of the university of texas school of law, said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bill’s language. “the next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the meaning of all these obstacles that congress snuck back into the bill at the last minute,” said vladeck. even with the revisions, detractors of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the united states or u.s. companies into court. some u.s. lawmakers said congress may revisit the law to narrow it further.  ultimately, though, if the victims of terrorist acts win a court  judgment against a foreign government, other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a slog. a reuters analysis last year found that in the 10 years following the sept. 11 attacks, the number of lawsuits filed under the u.s. anti terrorism act and similar laws more than tripled compared to the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of judgments in u.s. courts.  but judgments awarded against organizations or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets that can be claimed in the united states, their value often falls short of the award.

" u.s. president donald trump is expected to sign a measure as early as tuesday aimed at rescinding a major obama administration water regulation and direct an end to the government’s defense of the rule, a trump official briefed on the plan said late friday. trump is expected to direct the environmental protection agency to withdraw the waters of the united states (wotus) rule, which expands the number of waterways that are federally protected under the clean water act. the rule was finalized by the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers in may 2015, and was blocked by a federal appeals court pending further court challenges. the rule has faced intense opposition from republicans in congress, farmers and energy companies. critics contend the rule vastly expands the federal government’s authority and could apply to ditches and small isolated bodies of water. the epa under president barack obama said the rule protects waters that are next to rivers and lakes and their tributaries “because science shows that they impact downstream waters.” a white house spokeswoman did not comment on friday. trump is also expected to issue other environmental executive orders as early as next week, including a reversal of the obama administration’s clean power plant rule and instructing the interior department’s bureau of land management to lift a ban on new coal mining leases on federal lands. epa administrator scott pruitt told the wall street journal last week that he planned to quickly withdraw the clean power plant and wotus rules. “there’s a very simple reason why this needs to happen: because the courts have seriously called into question the legality of those rules,” pruitt told the newspaper. withdrawing the water and power plant rules will take time to meet regulatory requirements and will likely face court challenges from some democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups. last month, the u.s. supreme court agreed to resolve a dispute over what court should handle challenges of the water regulation. the justices said they would hear an appeal by the national association of manufacturers of a cincinnati based federal appeals court’s ruling that gave itself jurisdiction to review challenges to the clean water act regulation. the industry group wants challenges to the rule to be heard in district courts. dozens of agricultural groups, states and municipalities had sued to block the rule. the challengers contend the agencies’ change improperly expanded federal regulatory power.

" a north korean soldier defected to the south on monday after being shot and wounded by the north korean military, south korea said. the soldier was found on the south side of the border village of panmunjom, about 50 meters south of the military demarcation line, wounded in his shoulder and elbow, according to a south korean defense ministry official. he defected from a north korean guard post nearby and was being treated in hospital.  the defector was urgently transferred to hospital in a helicopter of the united nations command, and there was no exchange of fire with our side,  the ministry official told reuters.   since it was an area exposed to the north, we had to crawl toward there to get him out,  the official added. there was no immediate comment on the incident from north korea. while on average more than 1,000 north koreans defect to south korea every year, most travel via china and it is unusual for a north korean to cross the land border dividing the two koreas, which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. the last such crossing was in june. the south korean ministry official said the soldier s condition and military rank remained to be verified. the defection comes amid tension between the two koreas, and between the united states and the north.  north korea has this year been boosting its nuclear and missile capacity with a series of tests as it faces off with u.s. president donald trump who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the mainland united states with a nuclear weapon. north korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on sept. 3, but has not launched any missiles since firing one over japan on sept. 15, the longest such lull this year.

" president donald trump’s administration has dropped plans for an executive order that will require all u.s. food aid to be transported on american ships after members of congress protested, congressional and aid sources said on friday. reuters reported on thursday that trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on u.s. flagged vessels. senator bob corker, the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve. “i had a good conversation today with president trump,” corker said in a statement emailed to reuters. “as a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,” corker said. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment. although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of trump’s “america first” platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. aid groups, and members of congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. the united states, the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. about half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. the conservative leaning american enterprise institute said in a november report that shipping food aid on u.s. flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. jeremy konyndyk, a former director of usaid’s office of u.s. foreign disaster assistance, welcomed the administration’s decision to drop the order.  konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the washington based center for global development, said that with four potential famines in the world “it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.” corker has been pushing for years to reform the u.s. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. he said in his statement he looked forward to working with congress and the administration to achieve “long overdue reforms.” after hearing about the possible executive order, several members of congress called the white house to express their concern, congressional aides said.  the administration’s budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. that plan was also met with stiff opposition in congress, as lawmakers argued that “soft power” options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. supporters say trump’s initiative would not only create new u.s. jobs in the shipping industry but that u.s. controlled food shipments are important for national security because the u.s. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict.  food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. they said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower cost international carriers, requiring more u.s. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

" the european union on wednesday called on president barack obama to block a u.s. bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the sept. 11 attacks to sue saudi arabia, saying it was in violation of international law. “the possible adoption and implementation of the (bill) would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of state sovereign immunity,” the european union delegation to the united states said in a letter to the u.s. department of state seen by reuters. the letter said the eu considers that the bill’s adoption and its implementation could have unwanted consequences, as other states adopt similar legislation.  congress has overwhelmingly passed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, known as jasta, in reaction to long running suspicions, denied by saudi arabia, that hijackers of the four u.s. jetliners that attacked the united states in 2001  were backed by the saudi government.  obama in coming days is expected to veto the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue u.s. diplomats, service members or companies. but congress could have the last word if the senate and house of representatives each override that veto by a two thirds vote.

" the u.s. congress may be headed for a reckoning with the federal debt limit within weeks, thanks to wealthy americans and corporations deferring tax payments in the hope that they would benefit from the lower tax rates promised by president trump. trump promised tax cuts during his election campaign last year and has reiterated those promises in recent months leading some wealthy americans and businesses to shift accounting for income into the future, betting that lower tax rates will arrive, perhaps in 2018, wealth managers told reuters. “everyone wants to talk about deferring income,” said mark copeland, senior partner at signature estate & investment advisors llc in newport beach, california.  the u.s. stock market has also rallied since trump’s election victory in november, partly on hopes for lower corporate tax rates.  “we are starting to prepare clients for potentially lower taxes in 2018,” said julia carlson, chief executive and at financial freedom wealth management group llc in oregon. trump promised to cut taxes as far back as september 2015 in a four page plan and reiterated those promises in a two page “contract with the american voter” before last november’s election and again in a one page document in april, but republicans in congress remain divided on tax reform. the delay to tax payments could help to explain why tax receipts this fiscal year are coming in more slowly than projected, said tax experts and the congressional budget office (cbo), an arm of congress. “taxpayers may have shifted more income than projected ... to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year,” the cbo said in a monthly report on wednesday. the weaker tax revenues this year have forced the u.s. treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit and that is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts said. the u.s. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of congress. the need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in washington. conservative republicans like to use the debt limit issue as leverage to demand cuts in spending but democrats and moderate republicans usually oppose such ultimatums on the grounds that the borrowings are used to fund spending approved previously by congress.   this year, with trump’s legislative agenda stalled and congress preoccupied by trump’s firing of former fbi director james comey, the house republicans known as the house freedom caucus along with outside conservative groups are again demanding spending cuts for support to raise the debt limit. in 2011 the failure to raise the debt limit in a timely way and the possibility that the u.s. government might default on its obligations led to the u.s. losing its prized triple a credit rating from standard & poor’s. since mid march the u.s. treasury has been using emergency funding powers to postpone hitting the debt limit and those measures had been expected to last until about october, but lower tax receipts so far this year may mean the debt limit will be hit sooner than expected. treasury secretary steven mnuchin urged congress last month to raise the debt ceiling before lawmakers break for a long august summer recess, a call echoed last week by house democratic leader nancy pelosi.

" republican u.s. senator john mccain said on monday he would offer a plan for a u.s. strategy in the war in afghanistan as an amendment to a defense authorization bill in september. “eight years of a ‘don’t lose’ strategy has cost us lives and treasure in afghanistan,” mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a statement. “when the senate takes up the national defense authorization act in september, i will offer an amendment based on the advice of some our best military leaders that will provide a strategy for success in achieving america’s national interests in afghanistan.” ",0
" a senate panel on tuesday approved legislation to renew the national security agency’s internet surveillance program, while other lawmakers pushed a competing measure seeking to end the ability to search for data on americans without a warrant. the competing plans were likely to complicate congressional renewal of that law, known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, due to expire at the end of the year. the trump administration supports a permanent renewal of the program without any changes. the senate intelligence committee voted 12 3 to advance legislation renewing section 702 until dec. 31, 2025. the panel voted privately, meaning it did not immediately share the bill text, a common practice for the committee. senators richard burr and mark warner, the panel’s republican and democratic leaders, said in a statement the bill would protect national security while improving privacy protections for americans and adding transparency requirements about who can be targeted. the three no votes came from democrats, including senator ron wyden, an author of the alternative measure. u.s. intelligence officials value section 702, calling it a vital tool for fighting national and cyber security threats and helping protect american allies. it allows u.s. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states. the panel unanimously adopted an amendment from warner, requiring the federal bureau of investigation to send any queries it makes for u.s. data to the foreign intelligence surveillance court, according to a source familiar with the vote. the court would have two days to review the query for legality, the source said. privacy advocates have blasted the bill, saying it does not contain enough safeguards. some complained that a version of the bill that had leaked might even expand the u.s. government’s surveillance powers. fourteen other senators introduced legislation that would require the nsa to obtain a warrant for queries of data on americans under an internet surveillance program. the effort, led by wyden and republican rand paul, would reform other aspects of the warrantless program. the surveillance program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former nsa contractor edward snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.  those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the fbi. the usa rights act authored by wyden and paul would end that practice. the measure was introduced with support from more than 40 civil society groups, including the american civil liberties union and freedomworks. a companion bill was introduced in the house of representatives. it would renew section 702 for four years with additional transparency and oversight provisions, such as making it easier for individuals to raise legal challenges against the law and expand the oversight jurisdiction of the privacy and civil liberties oversight board, a government watchdog. earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the house introduced separate legislation to add privacy protections to section 702, including partially restricting the fbi’s ability to access u.s. data when investigating a crime. privacy groups criticized that plan as too narrow.

" a public interest group urged u.s. officials on wednesday to free up washington landmarks for thousands of people planning protests around the jan. 20 inauguration of president elect donald trump. the washington based partnership for civil justice fund said the national park service had handed over control of sites such  as the lincoln memorial to the private committee overseeing republican trump’s inauguration. the move had left at least a dozen protest groups without prime venues, a violation of americans’ constitutional rights, fund officials said. the national park service “has done a massive land grab inhibiting all those who want to exercise their right to free speech,” mara verheyden hilliard, a co founder of the fund, said at a news conference.  trump’s inaugural committee did not respond to a request for comment.  trump’s election on nov. 8 led to days of sometimes violent protests by people who said the new york businessman and former reality tv star encouraged racism, bigotry and misogyny in his campaign against democrat hillary clinton and was a threat to american values. national park service spokesman mike litterst said agency rules in place since 2008 give an inaugural committee preferential access to some public areas along pennsylvania avenue, the national mall and surrounding land. a federal court has upheld the rules and most public sidewalks along the parade route down pennsylvania avenue, the boulevard running from the capitol to the white house, are open to protesters. the nps  is reviewing the pending applications, litterst said in an email. the partnership for civil justice said that it was the first time in recent memory that permits to the land had been extended to a private inauguration committee in the days around a president’s swearing in. but it said that despite the decision, city law allowed peaceful street protests to go ahead without permits. the fund is prepared to sue to get the permits pulled so protesters may gather near the white house and the national mall, verheyden hilliard said.  district of columbia officials are expecting around a million people for the inauguration and events surrounding it. several groups have vowed to demonstrate. more than 135,000 people have said they would take part in a march for women’s rights the day after the ceremony. the committee has not said what it will do with the sites and the national park service has said it has no plans to use them, verheyden hilliard said.

" republican presidential candidate ted cruz said on friday he would make lifting tax and regulatory burdens a priority if elected president and protect the small banks he said were being hurt by stricter bank regulations. cruz, who is running to become the party’s 2016 nominee in the nov. 8 presidential election, targeted the dodd frank regulatory reform law as enabling the nation’s large banks. “the big banks have all gotten bigger,” cruz said in a cnbc interview. cruz has said he would not bail out big banks if they failed again, as the did during the 2007 8 financial crisis triggered by faulty mortgage lending practices. “the people that have been hammered are the little guys,” he said. “it’s the community banks, it’s the small financial institutions that are going out of business at a record pace.” the lawyers and lobbyist for giant banks were “in the room” with the democratic senators who wrote dodd frank because they could absorb the cost of that while the little banks could not, cruz said. cruz said the nation’s tax structure is helping strangle u.s. economic growth and he would try to scale back taxes including corporate and death taxes. cruz has advocated a flat tax rate, which he acknowledged would be difficult to enact. cruz said he would also try to achieve monetary stability and end the “roller coaster” with the u.s. dollar. the u.s. senator from texas told cnbc that a higher minimum wage would cost u.s. jobs and that setting minimum wage should be left up to states. raising the federal minimum wage has been a cornerstone of the democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders, although the two disagree on how much it should be raised from the current $7.25. republicans generally do not embrace a high minimum wage and front runner donald trump has embraced a lower federal rate.

" u.s. senator mark kirk on wednesday introduced legislation that would give the pentagon more flexibility in funding electronic warfare programs and speed often sluggish acquisition times. current acquisition rules make it tough for the u.s. military to quickly procure and field electronic warfare weapons systems before they are overtaken by developments around the world. kirk, an illinois republican and retired naval intelligence officer, said the bill would help the u.s. military accelerate work on electronic warfare weapons and stay ahead of other countries that are rapidly developing their own capabilities. “it is critical our military dominate the offensive and defensive ends of electronic warfare,” kirk said in a statement. “the need for enhanced electronic capabilities is even more pronounced on today’s battlefield.” senator kristen gillibrand, a new york democrat, is co sponsoring the bill. the bill would amend the fiscal 2016 defense policy bill to include electronic warfare, or ew, under the pentagon’s rapid acquisition authority (raa) program. that program lets program managers waive some acquisition rules to more quickly field technology. it would also allow the department to use different contract types, including those used for commercial items, when it buys ew weapons. the bill also includes directives for the pentagon’s new joint electronic warfare executive committee, which is headed by air force general paul selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, according to a kirk aide. the bill directs the committee to provide a strategic plan for the services to work together on electronic warfare systems, and tackle acquisition and budget processes, bolster training, fill capability gaps and advance offensive capabilities. kirk is expected to discuss the legislation during a visit to a northrop grumman corp facility in rolling meadows, il. on friday, the aide said.

" the two u.s. senators representing california said on friday they will propose a federal task force to investigate the cause and response to the massive natural gas leak near los angeles. democratic senators barbara boxer and dianne feinstein announced they will introduce an amendment to a national energy bill being debated by the senate that would direct u.s. energy secretary ernest moniz to lead a task force that will recommend how to solve the ongoing methane leak and prevent future incidents. southern california gas company’s aliso canyon natural gas storage facility, which sprung a leak in october that has not yet been sealed, has raised alarms about the danger of aging oil and gas infrastructure. there is little oversight of the 400 underground natural gas storage facilities in 30 u.s. states. “we have a responsibility not only to address this leak, but also to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,” feinstein said in a statement. the amendment is one of nearly 100 that senators have introduced or plan to offer next week, as the senate works to pass the country’s first major energy bill in over eight years. the bill, which aims to modernize the country’s aging energy infrastructure, is one of the few in congress to have bipartisan support. senate majority leader mcconnell said he expects the legislation to pass late next week, after members vote on the list of amendments. the california senators’ proposal would direct moniz to lead a six member intergovernmental task force to study the impacts of the leak on affected communities as well as the environment and issue its findings within six months. those findings and subsequent updates would help agencies such as the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the environmental protection agency (epa) help respond to the leak. the task force would recommend whether to continue operations at aliso canyon and other facilities in close proximity to densely populated areas. other amendments the senate will consider next week include a proposal by michigan democrats to deal with another environmental crisis   lead water contamination in flint. the proposal would also direct $200 million for a research center to focus on the needs of children, and would also require the epa to warn the public of high lead levels in drinking water if a state fails to do so.

" the u.s. air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following president donald trump s decision to forge ahead with the 16 year old war, its top general told reuters on tuesday. air force chief of staff general david goldfein said, however, he was still examining the matter, as the u.s. military s top brass had only begun the process of translating trump s war strategy into action. asked whether the air force would dedicate more assets to afghanistan, where the united states has been engaged in its longest military conflict, goldfein said only:  possibly.    it s actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus ups and reductions,  he said in a joint interview with air force secretary heather wilson. still, he acknowledged that the air force was  absolutely  examining the possibility of increasing air power, including to support u.s. ground forces, following trump s promise of a stepped up campaign against taliban insurgents, who have gained ground against u.s. backed afghan government forces.  goldfein said the same about providing training to afghan pilots. wilson, who assumed the air force s top civilian job three months ago, noted the afghan military had made strides thanks to u.s. training and equipment, but added:  i think there is a long way to go there, very honestly.   in a speech on monday night, trump appeared to answer a call from the top u.s. commander on the ground for thousands of more troops to break a stalemate with taliban insurgents, on top of the roughly 8,400 now deployed in afghanistan. trump said the united states would not disclose troop numbers, but one u.s. official told reuters they could start moving quickly. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he would set troop levels following the review by military chiefs. during the administration of trump s predecessor, barack obama, u.s. military officials privately expressed frustration about their inability to strike at many taliban targets   including training camps    unless they could show a direct threat to u.s. forces or major impact on the afghan state. wilson said trump appeared to be giving greater flexibility to strike insurgents.     obviously the joint chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals, but i think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night, and we re going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks,  wilson said.  goldfein said:  i thought that came out very loud and clear in the speech that that s his priority.  wilson and goldfein spoke to reuters while flying back to the united states after a nine day trip that included a visit to afghanistan, where the u.s. military has ramped up its firepower against islamic state in recent months even as it helps afghan forces battle the taliban.   particularly for the u.s. air force, the size of the american commitment to afghanistan far outweighs the number of airmen deployed there. a network of u.s. installations throughout the middle east supports the afghan campaign, including in qatar and the united arab emirates.  still, any substantial increase in u.s. targeting of the taliban and islamic state militants would likely require dedicating more u.s. military assets to build intelligence, strike insurgent targets and provide support to u.s. forces in the field. although the u.s. military is stretched, a string of u.s. coalition backed victories by iraqi forces against islamic state might free up some firepower and intelligence assets for afghanistan, experts say. air force spokesman brigadier general edward thomas declined to speculate on operational planning. but he noted that u.s. air power from the region could be deployed, if needed, including fighter aircraft, bombers and spy planes.     with the detailed planning that will follow the president s announcement, the air force will be ready to swing any additional airmen and aircraft to the fight as required,   thomas said.  trump ran for the presidency calling for a swift u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan, which the united states invaded in october 2001, and he acknowledged on monday that he was going against his instincts in approving the new campaign plan sought by his military advisers. wilson said trump s remarks represented a  strategic correction  in the war effort along with a significant shift in policy on pakistan. in his speech, trump delivered a sharp rebuke to islamabad for allowing taliban insurgents a safe haven from which launch attacks in afghanistan, and said it had  much to lose  unless it changed course. pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting u.s. and afghan government forces in afghanistan. reuters has reported that the united states has been considering a range of actions, including withholding aid to pakistan and, perhaps, ramping up drone strikes. successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan, and the u.s. military has been dependent in the past on overflight or land routes through pakistan to resupply its forces in landlocked afghanistan.   wilson did not rule out a future u.s. military role against militants in pakistan should islamabad fail to act, but she said trump s focus appeared to be on diplomatic efforts for now.   my assumption is that there will be some intense diplomatic pressure,  she said. goldfein said he was not aware of any changes to u.s. pakistani military ties, but acknowledged the military would take its cues from the state department.  i can tell you that i have a fairly robust dialogue with the pakistani air chief. i ve hosted him. he s hosted me,  goldfein said.  but that dialogue is always supportive of the diplomatic dialogue.

" as u.s. president donald trump and some of america s democratic allies talk up a vision of  indo pacific  cooperation, china is determined to ensure that the future belongs to  asia .   the increasing use of the phrase  indo pacific  by trump and his team during their marathon asian jaunt this week, instead of the  asia pacific  term that has long been common in business and diplomacy, is being greeted with thinly veiled sneers in beijing.  trump choosing to use the term and actually making it happen are two totally different things,  diao daming, an american studies expert at renmin university in beijing, told a forum on friday.    the region is leading global development and trump wants america to be first, so he could not ignore its existence. he had to say something to the region, so we have  indo pacific . but as yet it s just a concept and we don t know what it means.  beyond the wordplay lies both concern and scepticism in beijing at u.s. attempts to complicate china s strategic domain, particularly by encouraging rival power india to work more closely militarily with japan. tokyo recently backed new delhi during india s border stand off with china.    chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying did not dignify  indo pacific  by name in a statement this week, but noted that  this concept has been mentioned many times .    we hope that the asia pacific region can become a stable, prosperous and orderly region....where we are capable of managing differences and have the wisdom to resolve the disputes,  she said.    indo pacific  has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in australia, india and japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic led region in place of the  asia pacific , which to some places an authoritarian china too firmly at the center.   trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting in seoul and tokyo, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state rex tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a  free, open and thriving indo pacific .   describing the indian and pacific oceans as a  single strategic arena , tillerson went further as he described india and the united states as  bookends  within that region.    in concrete terms, it will lead to great co ordination between the indian, japanese and american militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.   not all allies are convinced, however.   when trump s white house issued a statement after the u.s. south korea summit on wednesday describing the alliance as a  linchpin for stability, security and prosperity in the indo pacific , south korea s presidential blue house issued a note of caution.   while the phrase  indo pacific  matched some of south korea s policies aimed at diversification,  we felt there was more discussion necessary to see whether it is an appropriate term to be used in our efforts toward...joint strategic goals , the blue house statement said.   welcoming the trend is indian navy captain gurpreet khurana, who was among the first to coin the indo pacific concept in an academic paper back in 2007.   the rise of india as an economic power following its free market reforms and then its gradual military build up was itself a key factor in the increasing significance of the indian ocean, he said.    india could no longer be excluded from any over arching reckoning in the asia pacific, be it economic or security related,  said khurana, of the military funded national maritime foundation. chinese officials and experts have long bristled at any perceived attempt to contain a rising china.  but trump s indo pacific policy should not be underestimated by china, because india, japan and australia are united by being on the wrong side of china s development strategy for the region, according to jia wenshan, an expert on china s foreign policy at the beijing based center for china and globalization.  china needs to as soon as possible deal with the indo pacific alliance, as it is absolutely in conflict with belt and road,  jia said, referring to the chinese president s signature initiative to re establish trade and infrastructure ties between china and nations throughout central and southeast asia.  behind indo pacific you have japan s economic support, india s development speed and australia s fears of china, these are all strategic realities.

" a “lone hacker” has taken responsibility for a cyber attack on the u.s. democratic national committee, which the dnc and a cyber security firm have blamed on the russian government. the dnc and cyber firm crowdstrike disclosed the attack on tuesday, saying that hackers working for russia broke into the dnc’s computer network, spied on internal communications and stole research on presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump. a russian government spokesman responded by saying that moscow had not been involved. on wednesday, an individual using the moniker guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the attack in a post on the blogging site wordpress.com, saying the dnc was “hacked by a lone hacker.” the dnc did not respond to a request for comment late on wednesday evening on guccifer 2.0’s claim. crowdstrike said it stands by findings that the russian government was behind the attacks.  guccifer 2.0’s blog includes images of documents it claims were stolen from dnc servers, including one titled “donald trump report,” which was dated dec. 19, and spreadsheets purportedly containing information about party donors.  reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the documents, which the blog said were among “thousands of files and mails” removed from dnc servers that would soon be published on wikileaks.  crowdstrike issued a statement saying it “stands fully by its analysis” that two groups affiliated with russian intelligence were discovered in the dnc’s network last month.  the company said it was reviewing the documents published by guccifer 2.0 to determine whether they were authentic.

" u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said a missile fired by yemen s houthi group toward saudi arabia on tuesday  bears all the hallmarks of previous attacks using iranian provided weapons  as she pushed the u.n. security council to act. saudi air defenses shot down the ballistic missile and there were no reports of casualties or damage. in contrast, a u.n. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 noncombatants in war torn yemen since dec. 6. saudi led forces, backing yemen s government, have fought the iran allied houthis in yemen s more than two year long war. iran has denied supplying the houthis with weapons, saying the u.s. and saudi allegations are  baseless and unfounded.    we must all act cooperatively to expose the crimes of the tehran regime and do whatever is needed to make sure they get the message. if we do not, then iran will bring the world deeper into a broadening regional conflict,  haley told the council.  haley said she was exploring, with some council colleagues, several options for pressuring iran to  adjust their behavior.  however, haley is likely to struggle to convince some members, like veto powers russia and china, that u.n. action is needed. russia s deputy u.n. ambassador vladimir safronkov told council on tuesday:  we need to abandon the language of threats and sanctions and to start using the instruments of dialogue and concentrate on broadening cooperation and mutual trust.  most sanctions on iran were lifted at the start of 2016 under the nuclear deal brokered by world powers and enshrined in a u.n. security council resolution. the resolution still subjects tehran to a u.n. arms embargo and other restrictions that are technically not part of the nuclear deal. haley said the security council could strengthen the provisions in that resolution or adopt a new resolution banning iran from all activities related to ballistic missiles.  under the current resolution, iran is  called upon  to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. some states argue that the language of the resolution does not make it obligatory.  we could explore sanctions on iran in response to its clear violations of the yemen arms embargo,  haley said.  we could hold the irgc (iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps) accountable for its violations of numerous security council resolutions.  a separate u.n. resolution on yemen bans the supply of weapons to houthi leaders and  those acting on their behalf or at their direction.

" kansas governor sam brownback has ordered state officials to cut off funding for planned parenthood and its affiliates through the state medicaid program, a move the organization said on wednesday it would challenge in court. brownback, a republican, said in his state of the state address on tuesday that he would direct the state health secretary to ensure that no taxpayer money go to planned parenthood, which he said trafficked in baby body parts. “no longer will we send the money of hard working kansans to fund an industry that disrespects life and violates the moral conscience of our people,” brownback said in a statement. the governor’s statement was an apparent reference to videos  secretly recorded by an anti abortion group that activists said showed that planned parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. planned parenthood has denied any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of the issue of fetal tissue donations. the organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under u.s. law. the kansas department of health and environment said it would issue a termination letter to planned parenthood of kansas and mid missouri. laura mcquade, president and chief executive of the kansas and mid missouri planned parenthood, said the planned termination would result in a legal battle. “kansans and their health care providers are not mr. brownback’s punching bag and we will fight back,” mcquade said. federal funds cannot be used for abortions, but planned parenthood also provides medicaid covered services such as contraception, cancer screening and other care. several states have sought to cut off funding for planned parenthood following the release of the videos. courts have blocked some of those attempts at least temporarily in utah, louisiana, alabama and other states.

" parties seeking to form germany s next government found common ground in areas of social policy and digital infrastructure on monday, but remain far apart on issues that provoked stormy clashes last week. talks between conservatives, greens and free democrats (fdp) resumed on monday after chancellor angela merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.  the weekend pause for thought did us good,  said andreas scheuer, a leader in the conservative christian social union (csu), the bavarian sister party to merkel s christian democrats (cdu). other party leaders agreed. but monday s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week. one sign of the division came in an interview merkel ally peter altmaier gave to the newspaper die zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. der spiegel magazine reported the fdp might head a weakened finance ministry, with key european affairs functions hived off to another ministry.  the finance ministry is a strong ministry and should remain so in future,  altmaier told die zeit. altmaier runs merkel s office and has been acting finance minister since wolfgang schaeuble s move agreed last month to leave the post and become president of parliament . negotiators emerged on monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development. after discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to merkel s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date. merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the sept. 24 national elections must forge a so called  jamaica  coalition   named because the three camps  colors match that country s flag   that is untested at national level. three more rounds of more detailed exploratory talks are planned for this week and four for next. if successful, the parties can then begin formal coalition talks.

" leaders of religious conservative groups largely stood behind donald trump on saturday, the day after vulgar sexual comments he made about women surfaced online, but some expressed concern that the u.s. republican presidential nominee’s remarks could depress evangelical turnout on election day. most evangelical leaders did not condemn trump, and instead pointed to an urgent need to prevent democratic nominee hillary clinton from winning the presidency, reshaping the supreme court and implementing liberal policies. the latest blow to trump’s campaign came after a 2005 video surfaced of the then reality tv star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. vice presidential running mate mike pence said he could not defend trump’s words. gary bauer, chairman of the campaign for working families, said trump’s “grossly inappropriate language” does not change the choice facing the country in the nov. 8 election and that “i continue to support the trump pence ticket.” “hillary clinton is committed to enacting policies that will erode religious liberty, promote abortion, make our country less safe, and leave our borders unprotected,” bauer said. white evangelicals make up about 20 percent of the u.s. population, according to the public religion research institute, and represent a crucial voting bloc trump needs to win the presidency. they have long represented a pillar of support for republicans. in 2004, they were instrumental in president george w. bush’s re election. they turned out in similar numbers in 2008 and 2012, when mitt romney, a mormon who many evangelicals considered too moderate, was the republican nominee, according to a report by the pew research center. support from evangelicals for trump has been strong throughout his campaign, even though it was only late in life that the new york businessman adopted their cause. social conservatives flocked to his side over other deeply religious republican presidential candidates, such as ted cruz. “naturally i’m disappointed,” said steve scheffler, head of the iowa faith and freedom coalition. “but, you know, the bible tells me that we are all sinners saved by grace and i don’t think there’s probably a person alive that i know of that hasn’t made some mistakes in the past.” he said clinton has peccadilloes of her own, most notably marital woes with her husband, former president bill clinton. “so yes, i will vote for donald trump. i’m not excusing his behavior at all. it’s disgusting,” he said. still, politically active christian conservative leaders across the country said they were worried that trump’s comments could depress turnout among evangelicals. “evangelicals are not going to vote for hillary,” said religious political activist david lane. “but this could cause them to stay home. this could be a big deal. things like this matter.” much will hinge on trump’s performance in the second presidential debate on sunday night, and whether he can convince christians that he is a changed man, lane said. “he already apologized and said he was wrong,” said lane. “i think he’s moving in the right direction. but he’s got to do really well in the debate sunday night.” other religious leaders, however, were less forgiving. russell moore, president of the ethics & religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention, tweeted an article detailing evangelical apathy toward the trump tape, calling it a “disgrace.” “what a scandal to the gospel of jesus christ and to the integrity of our witness,” moore wrote. still, the majority view among religious conservatives appeared to be summed up by tony perkins, president of the family research council action group, who said evangelicals “are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms.” “this is far from an ideal situation, but it is the reality in which we find ourselves and as difficult as it is, i refuse to find sanctuary on the sidelines and allow the country and culture to deteriorate even further by continuing the policies of the last eight years,” he said.

" in friday s speech laying out his strategy toward iran and his decision not to certify it is complying with the 2015 nuclear agreement, u.s. president donald trump made a series of statements that analysts questioned.  trump said he might terminate the deal under which iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, and laid out a more aggressive approach to counter iran s ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups. below are some of trump s controversial comments, along with analysis of their basis in fact. trump:  the previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with iran.   several foreign policy analysts said there was no reason to believe that the government of iran, whose economy suffered from economic sanctions that targeted its oil industry, was close to falling apart.  there is no evidence that i  aware of that would suggest that regime was on the verge of collapse,  said michael singh, an expert with the washington institute for near east policy who served on republican president george w. bush s national security council staff.  the sanctions were having a pretty strong impact on the iranian economy. especially because of the oil sanctions, you had a real contraction of iranian economy,  he said.  but saying anything beyond that is a matter of speculation.  in fact, singh argued, the pressure brought on tehran from international sanctions  could actually help to unite factions within iran  and thereby strengthen its rulers. trump:  the nuclear deal threw iran s dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created. it also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.     the $100 billion, in fact, already belonged to iran and represented foreign assets blocked by sanctions. it was unfrozen with the lifting of international sanctions under the deal, formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa). but, experts said that tehran would see only a fraction of that sum because of debts it owed, including $20 billion to china for infrastructure projects. various estimates put the actual amount tehran received at between $60 and $35 billion.     in addition, roughly $1.7 billion was handed over to iran that stemmed from an uncompleted arms deal between the united states and the government of the late shah, which paid a $400 million deposit before being toppled in iran s 1979 revolution.  the remaining $1.3 billion represented interest owed on the $400 million, according to u.s. officials, who used the money as leverage to obtain the release of five u.s. citizens held in iran. the obama administration repaid the deposit with pallets of cash delivered by aircraft.  on iran having made multiple violations of the nuclear deal trump:  the iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. for example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. until recently, the iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.   the international atomic energy agency (iaea), the u.n. nuclear watchdog charged with monitoring the deal, says that tehran is in full compliance   a judgment the trump administration twice previously affirmed   and that  nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under the jcpoa are being implemented.   at present, iran is subject to the world s most robust nuclear verification regime,  iaea director general yukiya amano said in a statement after trump s speech.  iran has exceeded the 130 metric ton cap on its heavy water stockpile and run more advanced centrifuges   the devices that purify uranium   than permitted by the deal and arguably exceeded the limits on its low riched uranium supply. but experts say that iran quickly corrected all of the infractions and, most importantly, argued that iran had not committed a deal rupturing  material breach.   multiple violations is an exaggeration. there are very few actual violations,  said robert einhorn, a nonproliferation expert who worked at the state department under former president barack obama and is now at the brookings institution think tank.  they sought to exploit any ambiguity in the text, but when they did that the united states pushed back and a reasonable outcome was reached in every case,  he said.

" britain must choose from a range of existing off the peg models for its relationship to the european union when it leaves the bloc, brussels  chief negotiator michel barnier has told a group of newspapers. barnier, who is leading the eu s negotiations with britain after last year s brexit vote, told handelsblatt that while it was in both sides  interest to maintain a close relationship, the range of possible relationships was limited.  the only way to do it without difficulties is by staying within the internal market. that would be the norway model, but the british government rejects it,  he said.  another option would be a free trade agreement like the ceta deal with canada.  even a canada style deal would take several years to negotiate. asked if there would be a specific british model after the country left on march 30, 2019, barnier said:  no.  european leaders decided this weekend that britain had not made enough progress on exit negotiations to begin work on devising a future relationship, leading to concern in europe and the world that britain could crash out of the bloc in disorderly fashion, with serious economic and political consequences.  a disorderly exit would bring enormous problems   mainly for britain, but also for us,  he said in the interview with handelsblatt and four further european newspapers. that would affect everything from food supply to healthcare. he added:  britain would leave the single air traffic space, losing take off and landing rights. it would no longer be a member of the euratom treaty and could no longer import nuclear material from the eu for hospitals and power stations.  the process of designing a longer term relationship with the eu was also fraught with difficulties, he added, warning that the eu would need to find ways to head off any british attempts to undercut european environmental or welfare standards.  we will have to arrange future co operation on defense and security policy in a separate treaty,  he said.  we will have to ward off british attempts to influence our decision making processes in this area.

" saif al islam gaddafi, the most prominent son of the former libyan leader, is in good health and is following the political situation in libya from his base inside the country, a gaddafi family lawyer said on tuesday. khaled al zaidi said he was in personal contact with saif, but refused to say where in libya saif was, or whether he had ever left zintan, the western town where he was detained after the 2011 revolt in which his father was toppled and killed.  he s working on politics from his base in libya, with the tribes, with the cities, with the decision makers,  zaidi told reporters in tunis.  he s in a good health ... in top condition. his medical and psychological condition are good.  saif was seen by some as a potential reformist successor to his father in the years before 2011 and remains a key figure for gaddafi loyalists. seeking to rebuild their influence, they present saif as someone who can help reconcile the country s rival factions, though he is sought for alleged war crimes both in his home country and by the international criminal court.  the aim is to achieve peace in libya,  said zaidi.  he follows libyan affairs closely every day.  in june, zaidi said saif had been freed in zintan under an amnesty law passed two years ago by a parliament based in eastern libya.  earlier reports that saif had been liberated turned out to be false, and uncertainty about his whereabouts and status have long fueled rumors. those included speculation during the summer that he was about to re emerge with a speech or public statement.  no physical evidence of saif s whereabouts has been offered. he was last seen by an independent international observer in june 2014. a tripoli court sentenced saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. the international criminal court, based in the netherlands, is also seeking his arrest and said in june it was trying to verify the reports of saif s release.

" the head of an iran backed iraqi shi ite militia has visited lebanon s border with israel accompanied by hezbollah fighters, a video released on saturday showed, in a show of iranian influence that lebanon s prime minister called illegal. qais al khazali, leader of the iraqi paramilitary group asaib ahl al haq, declared his readiness  to stand together with the lebanese people and the palestinian cause , in the video footage widely circulating on social media. his appearance at the frontier is likely to be seen in the middle east as an example of tehran demonstrating its reach, and could add to tension in lebanon, caught in a regional tussle between iran and saudi arabia. lebanese prime minister saad al hariri issued a statement saying the border visit by a paramilitary in uniform violated lebanese law. he had instructed security chiefs to  prevent any person from carrying out activities of a military nature on the country s territory and to prevent any illegal actions , and barred khazali from entering the country, it said.     lebanon is still recovering from a crisis triggered a month ago, when hariri announced his resignation while visiting saudi arabia, accusing iran and hezbollah of meddling in regional conflicts in violation of lebanon s policy of non intervention. hariri returned to lebanon two weeks later and withdrew his resignation last week, while his government restated its non intervention policy. hezbollah, a heavily armed shi ite group that fights openly in syria as an ally of iran, serves in the power sharing government with hariri, a sunni muslim politician with deep business and political ties to saudi arabia. a commander in an alliance between hezbollah, iran and russia, who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity, said al khazali was accompanied by officers from asaib ahl al haq and visited the entire border with  occupied palestine . the commander did not say when the visit took place. in the video, an unidentified commander, presumably from hezbollah, gestures toward military outposts in northern israel and explains to khazali that they were hit by hezbollah missiles in previous confrontations between the group and israel.  we are now on the border separating southern lebanon with occupied palestine with our brothers in hezbollah, and announce our full preparedness to stand united...against the israeli occupier,  khazali says in the video.  hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said in june that any future war waged by israel against syria or lebanon could draw in fighters from countries including iran and iraq. iran s revolutionary guards, who established hezbollah in lebanon in 1982, have mobilized shi ite militias from around the region in recent years. they have fought islamic state in iraq and helped president bashar al assad in the war in syria.

" the chicago city council on wednesday approved mayor rahm emanuel’s fiscal 2017 budget which calls for a tax on plastic bags and the first phase of hiring more than 900 police officers. the council voted 48 0 for the budget which begins on jan. 1. emanuel last month unveiled his $9.8 billion all funds spending plan, which includes $3.7 billion for operations. the budget relies on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies, and a few one time measures   but no big tax hike. “to think that we’re on the verge today of passing a budget with almost unanimity is remarkable,” alderman ed burke said just before the vote. emanuel last year pushed through a $543 million phased in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. the city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage in september to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency. the council previously increased a telephone surcharge for laborers’ pensions. credit ratings for the nation’s third largest city have been deteriorating due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for chicago’s four retirement systems.  the new budget includes a 7 cent fee on store bags and parking rate hikes. it also accommodates the initial phase of the mayor’s two year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city’s sharp spike in violence. “this is the first year in recent memory that we’ve made investments in public safety with the addition of 1,000 police officers,” said alderman jason earvin. “and we can direct investment in some of the most challenged communities ... and with our youth in some of the most troubled parts of the city.” after the vote, emanuel noted record high summer job creation for youth, record high project starts in commercial and residential real estate and the city using reforms to place pensions on the path to solvency. “chicago’s employment is at a 15 year high that we haven’t seen since 2000 since the tech bubble,” emanuel said. “what we have done, not just today, but over the last five years is give people confidence in the city that we are going to take care of our business, get our fiscal house in order.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump is considering 11 people to replace fired fbi director james comey, according to a white house official, and the department of justice will begin interviewing people on friday or during the weekend. white house spokesman sean spicer told a briefing that trump would fill the job “as soon as he finds a candidate that fits the qualities that he feels are necessary to lead the fbi.” the pick will be under intense scrutiny since comey was fired while leading the federal bureau of investigation’s probe of possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russia. here are the 11 people under consideration:  kelly was new york city’s police commissioner longer than any other person. although the city saw historic drops in crime under his leadership, there is some controversy over his use of stop and frisk, an anti crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband. trump has praised that method. the former fbi agent was a congressman from michigan until 2015 and served as chairman of the house intelligence committee. rogers also briefly advised trump’s transition team on national security issues. fisher was an assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the department of justice under former president george w. bush. she currently works at the law firm latham & watkins. gowdy is a house representative from south carolina and a former federal prosecutor. he led a two year special congressional committee investigation that accused former secretary of state hillary clinton’s state department of failing to protect four americans killed in a 2012 attack in libya.  the republican senator from texas is the senate’s second ranking member. he previously was texas attorney general.  abbate has long worked in the fbi and currently serves as the executive assistant director for the criminal, cyber, response and services branch. before that, he was the assistant director in charge of the washington field office.  the former new york prosecutor currently serves as an associate judge on the new york court of appeals.  suthers is the former colorado attorney general and the current mayor of colorado springs, colorado. he also was the executive director of the colorado department of corrections. luttig, a former justice department lawyer and appellate court judge, has served as executive vice president and general counsel of boeing since 2006. thompson was u.s. deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 under bush. he also served as senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel for pepsico.  mccabe became acting director of the fbi this week following trump’s abrupt firing of comey. until tuesday, he was the bureau’s deputy director.

" in 2009, a pop video from north korea celebrated a new national hero   one that outside experts would later realize was at the heart of the secretive state s banned nuclear and missile programs.  that hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the computer numerical control (cnc) machine.  big, grey and boxy, cnc machines use pre programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. they offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.  in north korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. they allow kim jong un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.  nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.  special section: north korea revealed. interactive: nuclear north korea  interactive: kim s latest act of defiance  north korea s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with cnc machine tools,  said jeffrey lewis, head of the east asia nonproliferation program at the middlebury institute of strategic studies at monterey, california.   (they) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,  said lewis.  since 1996, cnc machines have been included in the wassenaar arrangement   an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. north korea is not a signatory.  the country s celebrations of its cnc technology have been fulsome. hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the cnc pop song, titled  break through the cutting edge,  at a korean workers  party celebration in 2010. in 2012, the year the south korean hit  gangnam style  was released, the north s cnc title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to choson exchange, a singapore based company that trains north koreans in business skills. the official video for the song opens with a long range north korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.  north korea likely started to develop its own cnc machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. it probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the soviet union.  its first homemade cnc machine was introduced in 1995. former leader kim jong il gave the machine the  ryonha  brand, according to a 2009 article in the country s official newspaper, rodong sinmun. that was the first time state media mentioned the technology.  by 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of north korean propaganda, as pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long range missile launch that year.  at the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader kim jong il to a north korean factory where homemade cnc machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. these could be used for nuclear centrifuges.   by around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of cnc machines,  said kim heung gwang, a north korean defector who taught at pyongyang s hamhung computer technology university before defecting to south korea.  but it wasn t until 2013 that the korea ryonha machinery joint venture corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the u.n. security council for supporting the weapons programs.  and it was only in august this year that u.s. intelligence officials told reuters north korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (full story)  now, kim heung gwang estimates, north korea has about 15,000 cnc machines. he bases this on north korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.  pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of  juche , which champions self sufficiency. but that wasn t strictly true.  in august 2016, state media released photos of kim jong un visiting a factory using cnc machines with the logo of swiss engineering firm abb abb.ul, one of the leading players in the global cnc machine market. it s not clear when or how the machine reached north korea.  abb said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against north korea, and undertakes not to deliver abb equipment to the country.  that said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to dpr of korea without our knowledge or permission,  the company said in response to a reuters inquiry, using north korea s official title.  a united nations panel monitoring sanctions on north korea said in a report this year that tengzhou keyongda cnc machine tools co of china had been a supplier of pyongyang s new cnc machines. a sales representative for tengzhou keyongda told reuters the company stopped selling cnc machines to north korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.  despite sanctions, cnc machines are commonplace across north korean manufacturing and can be brought in through china and russia, said lee choon geun, a senior fellow at the science and technology policy institute in south korea.  the biggest loophole has been that while some cnc machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry.  given their dual use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,  said lee.  the cnc song highlights this in its opening line:  whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there s a program to make it,  it says.

" u.s. president barack obama called incoming philippines president rodrigo duterte on tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries’ alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the white house said. u.s. officials have signaled that washington is ready to work with duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. obama’s deputy national security adviser, ben rhodes, told a washington seminar earlier on tuesday that the u.s. administration was aware there was some “controversy” surrounding duterte and “statements that drew attention in the past,” but he did not elaborate. obama offered his congratulations to duterte as the “presumptive president elect.” he won the largest share of the votes in a may 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. obama “highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,” the white house said. washington hoped “to build on progress made with the last administration” in the philippines, rhodes said. “this is a new government and we’ll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,” he said when asked about the election, adding that washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. he has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of u.s. national security interests given china’s increasingly assertive stance in asia and maritime disputes in the south china sea. duterte’s vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. rhodes noted u.s. support for manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with china in the south china sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater u.s. military presence in the philippines.  “we believe that now as much as ever it’s important that the u.s. and philippines are seen working together,” he said. the u.s. stance on duterte could echo its approach toward india’s prime minister narendra modi. at one point, modi was unable to obtain a u.s. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the white house when he became prime minister.

" china has proposed a three phase plan for resolving the rohingya crisis, starting with a ceasefire, that has won the support of myanmar and bangladesh, the foreign ministry said. more than 600,000 muslim rohingya have fled to bangladesh since late august driven out by a military clearance operation in buddhist majority myanmar s rakhine state. the rohingyas  suffering has caused an international outcry. visiting the myanmar capital naypyitaw, chinese foreign minister wang yi said china believed that the issue could be addressed by a solution acceptable to neighbors myanmar and bangladesh through consultations. a ceasefire should be followed by bilateral dialogue to find a workable solution, the ministry website reported late on sunday. the third and final phase should be to work toward a long term solution. wang said a ceasefire was basically in place already, and the key now was to prevent a flare up. he hoped the two sides could soon sign and implement an agreement already reached on repatriation. the international community and the united nations security council should give encouragement and support to both countries  to create the necessary conditions and a good environment , it quoted wang as saying at a joint press conference with aung san suu kyi, myanmar s de facto leader. myanmar was supportive of the chinese plan, as was bangladesh, where wang visited earlier in the weekend. in dhaka wang said the international community should not complicate the situation.

" iraqi shi ite militias illegally detained villagers near the islamic state held district of hawija in northern iraq and subjected them to torture and ill treatment, human rights watch said on thursday. the leader of one of the militias, which are known as popular mobilisation forces (pmf), denied the accusation and said their fighters were strictly following the law in their dealings with civilians fleeing military operations in the area.  iraq launched an offensive on september 21 to dislodge islamic state from hawija, which lies west of the oil city of kirkuk and is one of two areas of the country still under the control of the militants. men from villages near hawija were detained by militias from the badr organisation, a pro iran, shi ite grouping that is playing a major role in baghdad s war against islamic state, and were taken to an unknown location, the hrw report said, based on interviews with villagers evacuated to a nearby refugee camp. the villagers told hrw they had seen militia fighters using their gun butts to beat the detained men. during their detention the fighters brought them food only once and only a small amount of water but did not let them use a bathroom.  human rights watch has documented that pmf groups, including units affiliated with the badr organization, have screened, detained, and tortured people during the military operations,  said the report.women were also detained briefly by iraqi security forces and were questioned about their male relatives  activities before being transported to the refugee camp, hrw said.  while iraqi forces do need all the help they can get, the government should not allow abusive forces to use this opportunity for even more abuse,  said sarah leah whitson, middle east director at human rights watch. the iraqi government was not immediately available to comment on the hrw report, but local badr commander kareem al mohammedawi denied that villagers  rights had been abused.  we are strictly ordering our fighters to abide by the law and avoid mistreating refugees fleeing the fighting. but when we suspect someone is a terrorist we normally arrest him and hand him over to the security forces,  he said.           hawija and a stretch of land along the syrian border are the last pieces of iraq still in the hands of islamic state, which overran about a third of the country in 2014.

" maryland became the latest state to join in legal challenges against president donald trump’s revised temporary travel ban on friday, with its attorney general saying it would join a lawsuit brought by washington and other states. attorney general brian frosh said his office would formally join the suit on monday. “the administration persists in an effort to implement a policy that is inhumane and unconstitutional, but also makes us less safe, not more safe,” frosh said in a statement. the new travel order, which is set to take effect on wednesday, replaced a more sweeping ban issued on jan. 27 that caused chaos and protests at airports.  the first order, which temporarily halted the entry of refugees and travelers from seven muslim majority countries, was hit by more than two dozen lawsuits.  detractors claimed it discriminated against muslims and violated the u.s. constitution.  the government has said the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the travel rules are necessary to protect against terrorist attacks. “trump’s second executive order is still a muslim ban,” frosh said in the statement.  the state of washington brought one of the suits against the original ban, and last month a federal judge in seattle ordered an emergency halt to the policy. that ruling was upheld by an appeals court in san francisco. washington is now asking the court to apply the emergency halt to the new ban, arguing it is a veiled version of the old one. the new order keeps a 90 day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen, but excludes iraq. refugees are still halted from entering the country for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria. oregon and minnesota also are joining washington’s challenge. hawaii has a separate case pending against the new ban.  frosh said the ban would make maryland less competitive by deterring visits by academics, scientists and engineers from other countries and would hurt maryland’s universities and economy. the u.s. department of justice has declined to comment on the states’ cases because the litigation is pending.

" japan s health ministry is likely to drastically water down a proposal restricting smoking in restaurants, media said on friday, a move that risks tokyo becoming one of the unhealthiest hosts of the olympic games hosts in years. japan ranks at the bottom globally in anti smoking measures, going by the types of public spaces entirely free of smoke, says the world health organization, which has teamed up with global olympics officials to guarantee smoke free games venues. ahead of the 2020 summer olympics, the international olympics committee (ioc) is among those pressuring the japanese capital to follow rio de janeiro and other recent games hosts in banning smoking in all public areas. ioc vice president john coats has said the body cannot force a ban beyond the venues and the olympic village, however.  the health ministry was forced this year to scale back a proposed bill for a blanket ban on public smoking in the face of opposition by pro smoking politicians, restaurateurs and japan tobacco, which is one third government owned. but even the weaker bill foundered, due to opposition from the ruling liberal democratic party (ldp). in august, anti smoking health minister yasuhisa shiozaki lost his job in a cabinet reshuffle. now the ministry contemplates allowing smoking indoors at establishments that have a floor area of up to five times the 30 square meters (323 square feet) and adequate ventilation stipulated in the earlier bill, media said. however, a health ministry official told reuters the new proposal was still in such an early stage of discussion that none of its content had yet been decided. fifty years ago, around half of japanese smoked, a figure that has shrunk to less than a fifth now. smoking areas have been dramatically restricted, but laws vary among cities. there is still a cigarette vending machine in a health ministry annex. health officials say 15,000 japanese die every year from second hand smoke. the new proposal is  terrible,  says anti smoking activist manabu sakuta, since nearly 90 percent of food and beverage establishments in tokyo are smaller than 150 square meters (180 sq yards). but he is pinning his hopes on tokyo governor yuriko koike, who vowed in july to push for a smoking ban before the olympics.  there s some possibility here, so we ll have to focus on that,  he said.

" saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman has ordered a crackdown on corruption, the latest in a wave of frenetic changes in the kingdom over the past 2 1/2 years. prince mohammed says he is determined to remodel his conservative country into a modern state no longer dependent on oil. as his father, king salman bin abdulaziz, has handed the 32 year old prince mohammed more and more power over the past three years, the ambitious young leader has taken on everything from economic reforms to waging war in neighboring yemen. here is what you need to know. prince mohammed capped his rapid rise to power in june this year by replacing his elder cousin prince mohammed bin nayef, widely known as mbn, as crown prince. a source close to king salman said mbn s dismissal was  in the higher interests of the state  because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, a legacy of an assassination attempt that left shrapnel in his body. reuters could not independently confirm mbn s addiction issues. anti corruption campaign prince mohammed tightened his grip on power with the start of the anti corruption campaign at the weekend, purging the kingdom s political and business elite. among those arrested were 11 princes.  many saudis welcomed the moves as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds by the powerful. u.s. president donald trump said those arrested had been  milking  their country for years  but some western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in riyadh s opaque tribal and royal politics. prince mohammed launched a military campaign in neighboring yemen in march 2015. a saudi led coalition, acting on an invitation from the internationally recognized government, has targeted the iran aligned houthi movement in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people. the war is closely identified with the prince in his role as defense minister. his image once adorned war propaganda but is rarely associated with the war now, although he has said it must continue in order to quash iranian influence. even before the conflict, yemen was the poorest country on the arabian peninsula and now millions of people there are facing famine and a cholera epidemic. the coalition denies it blocks commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel. prince mohammed has helped lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate qatar, saying riyadh s erstwhile ally backs terrorism and cozies up to iran. qatar rejects the accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors  backing for authoritarian rulers. the campaign has divided gulf arab countries, who washington regards as essential to its influence in the region. qatar had incensed riyadh by cheering arab spring uprisings against some autocratic arab rulers.  saudi arabia s rivalry with iran, its competitor for influence in the middle east, has deepened as king salman and prince mohammed worked to build a sunni coalition against tehran and its allies in the arab world.  in may, as deputy crown prince, prince mohammed used unusually provocative language to rule out dialogue with revolutionary shi ite muslim theocracy iran, which he said was trying to interfere in arab lands and dominate the muslim world. on tuesday, state media quoted him as describing iran s supply of rockets to militias in yemen as  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war.  prince mohammed has also opened a new front in the proxy war with iran by threatening tehran s ally hezbollah and its home country lebanon. the resignation on saturday of the saudi allied lebanese prime minister, saad al hariri, announced from riyadh, was widely seen as the first act on this new front. the crown prince has also sought the help of shi ite leaders in iraq to try to reverse iran s dominant role there and shore up security on the kingdom s northern border, and has tried to improve ties with the united states under trump, who shares his and king salman s antipathy to iran s government. the planned sale of about 5 percent of national oil company saudi aramco [ipo armo.se] next year is a centerpiece of vision 2030, prince mohammed s blueprint to move the economy away from what he called its  addiction to oil  toward the private sector. the ipo is expected to raise as much as $100 billion but investors wonder whether aramco can be valued anywhere close to the $2 trillion figure announced by the crown prince and there has been market speculation that the ipo could be delayed beyond 2018 or shelved. he recently stated it would happen next year. many saudis have misgivings about the sale, with some fearing riyadh is selling cheaply at a time of low oil prices. vision 2030 has begun to reduce a big state budget deficit with austerity measures but has not yet created major new sources of non oil growth or jobs. the phased removal of subsidies on fuel, water and electricity has started but some austerity moves have been unpopular. already, some have been reversed or delayed as the economy has slowed because of low oil prices.  the plan includes private investment and privatizations and building the world s largest sovereign wealth fund. the aim is to create jobs and raise the participation of women in the workforce from 22 percent now to 30 percent by 2030.  saudi arabia adheres to an austere wahhabi brand of sunni islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas.  prince mohammed s ascent represents a social and cultural sea change, with power set to be passed to a much younger generation seemingly more in tune with young saudis. in moves that reinforce that perception, women will be permitted to drive from next year and allowed to attend sports events.  the crown prince has also said the country will move to a more open and tolerant interpretation of islam, and reforms have begun in areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy such as education, courts and the law. saudi authorities have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre date islam. last month prince mohammed announced a $500 billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into jordan and egypt, part of his efforts to reduce dependence on oil. the 26,500 square km (10,230 square mile) zone, known as neom, will focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, and will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy. the crown prince says the government, public investment fund and local and international investors are expected to sink billions into the zone in coming years. the crown prince told reuters neom would be floated on financial markets alongside aramco.

" u.s. democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine on sunday accused donald trump of inciting violence against hillary clinton after the republican candidate said clinton’s security detail should be disarmed given her support for tighter gun rules. kaine, speaking on fox news sunday, called trump’s remarks irresponsible. “when you look at a series of these comments that he’s making, i do believe it is an incite or at a minimum an expression of indifference to whether violence would occur,” he said. on friday, trump said at a campaign rally that clinton’s “bodyguards should drop all weapons. they should disarm.” “take their guns away, she doesn’t want guns. take them, let’s see what happens to her. take their guns away, okay. it will be very dangerous,” he added. new jersey governor chris christie, a top adviser to trump, told fox news sunday that trump’s comments had been misinterpreted and demanded that kaine apologize to trump for suggesting he had a malicious intent. “senator kaine should be ashamed of himself for saying that donald trump would like to have violence perpetrated against hillary clinton but it just shows how desperate and scared the clinton kaine campaign is now because this race now is a dead heat and they can’t believe it,” christie said. trump’s vice presidential running mate, mike pence, called any interpretation of trump’s friday remarks as a call to violence “absolute nonsense.” “his comment was that if she didn’t have all that security, she’d change her attitude about the right to keep and bear arms. and i’ll bet that’s probably true,” pence said on abc’s “this week. trump was criticized by opponents last month when he suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop clinton from nominating liberal u.s. supreme court justices, a comment some interpreted as encouraging a political assassination. “if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,” trump told a rally in north carolina on aug. 9. “although the second amendment people, maybe there is, i don’t know,” he said. in that case, trump’s campaign also insisted that his comments were not intended to incite violence.

" israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on monday he planned to push u.s. president donald trump to renew sanctions against iran during a visit to washington next month, complaining that iran had once more tested a ballistic missile. netanyahu has been harshly critical of the deal that six world powers including the united states under president barack obama struck with iran to curb its nuclear program in return for an end to multilateral sanctions. iran is israel’s avowed enemy and israel argues that the agreement fails to prevent iranian weapons posing a threat to its very existence. during the u.s. election campaign, trump called the pact a “disaster” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, though he has also said it would be hard to overturn an agreement enshrined in a u.n. resolution. in a statement on his personal twitter account, around the same time the white house announced his feb. 15 visit, netanyahu said: “iran again launched a ballistic missile. this is a flagrant violation of a security council resolution.” a u.s. official said on monday that iran had test fired a medium range ballistic missile on sunday, which exploded after 630 miles. “in my upcoming meeting with president trump i intend to bring up the renewal of sanctions against iran,” netanyahu said. “iran’s aggression cannot be left without a response.”  the obama administration said iran’s ballistic missile tests had not violated the nuclear agreement, but trump has said he will stop tehran’s missile program. under the u.n. resolution approving the nuclear deal, iran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. critics of the deal have said the language is ambiguous and does not make compliance obligatory, while tehran says the missiles it has tested are not specifically designed to carry nuclear warheads.  this month, iranian lawmakers approved plans to increase military spending, including expanding the long range missile program.

" a democratic bid to transfer the highly coveted political power of drawing legislative boundaries from state lawmakers to the democratically controlled illinois supreme court overwhelmingly passed the state house of representatives on tuesday. the proposed amendment to illinois’ constitution sailed through the house on a 105 7 vote and now must be approved by a three fifths majority in the state senate by friday in order to be placed on the nov. 8 general election ballot. since democrats controlled the state legislature and the governor’s office after the 2010 census, they won the once a decade right to draw new legislative district boundaries. the process enabled the party to build super majorities in both the senate and house. “the power we presently have is only to protect incumbents,” said representative jack franks, a democrat from chicago’s far northwest suburbs who sponsored the amendment. republican governor bruce rauner campaigned to take away legislative redistricting responsibilities from the general assembly but instead backs a different proposal. under franks’ plan, the illinois supreme court would appoint an eight member redistricting commission to oversee the drawing of 118 house districts and 59 state senate districts beginning with the 2022 elections. critics disliked how franks’ amendment mutes the general assembly’s voice in the process. “what’s dangerous about what we’re doing (is that) we as a legislative branch are ceding our authority to a co equal branch of government,” said representative christian mitchell, a chicago democrat who voted against the amendment. if the plan clears the senate, the result could be two competing redistricting proposals on the fall ballot, a scenario rauner has warned would confuse voters. the initiative rauner backs is being pushed by a bipartisan coalition that includes republican former governor jim edgar and former white house chief of staff william daley, brother and son of two of chicago’s longest serving democratic mayors. that group, known as independent maps, proposes a system where a bi partisan, 11 member commission would be stocked through a random and public screening process overseen by the state auditor general from a pool of 100 finalists.

" the wife of a detained former mexican governor is living in britain and has demanded back artwork, golf clubs and crystal that were seized by the government, according to a letter obtained by news site animal politico. karime macias is the wife of former ruling party veracruz governor javier duarte, who is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement and organized crime, in a case that public auditors said was the worst they had ever seen in mexico. in the letter, which the news site posted online, macias said she was forced to leave the country and shelter in the uk because of  persecution  at home. reuters did not obtain the letter and could not verify its authenticity. macias  lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. macias has not been charged with any crime. neither the attorney general s office nor the veracruz government responded to requests for comment.  macias confirmed in the letter that diaries in which she had reportedly written  i deserve abundance  repeatedly were hers, and said that her phrases were of a spiritual nature. macias said she wanted back personal items including paintings, luxury pens, golf clubs and books that she said were seized by prosecutors without a warrant, adding that she feared other items found were planted there. in april, duarte was arrested in a guatemala hotel where he had been with his wife after fleeing the country. he has denied any wrongdoing, and macias was not detained. top mexican auditor asf said in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under duarte were the highest amount it had ever seen. prosecutors say duarte headed an organization consisting of at least nine other people, whose criminal operations were carried out in veracruz, the eastern gulf state of campeche and mexico city between 2011 and 2016. at a hearing in july, a judge gave prosecutors six months to proceed with the investigation against duarte. he is one of four ex governors detained this year from president enrique pena nieto s institutional revolutionary party, or pri. corruption is one of the central issues in mexico s july 2018 election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict of interest rows that have dogged the cabinet and pena nieto himself.

" the united states issued about 50 percent fewer visitor visas in april to citizens of seven countries covered by president donald trump’s temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year, according to a reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on thursday. the total number of u.s. non immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was about 15 percent lower in april compared with the 2016 monthly average. the april data shows the continuation of a trend identified in data for the month of march, which the state department released last month. that data showed that citizens of the seven muslim majority countries under the bans   iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen   received about 40 percent fewer visitor visas in march than in an average month last year.  [nl1n1hz2pj] trump’s travel bans have been blocked by the courts. citizens of the seven countries received about 2,800 non immigrant visas in april 2017, compared with about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. data from previous years is only available in aggregate by fiscal year, rather than month by month. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8efbm) the state department released the data to comply with a directive from trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world. the agency did not release data on the number of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of visas is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times. “visa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level,” said william cocks, a spokesman for the state department’s bureau of consular affairs. trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make americans safer from attacks, signed an executive order on jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the united states for 90 days. after the order was blocked by federal courts, the trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower ban which dropped iraq from the list. courts have also halted parts of the second order. on thursday, a u.s. appeals court refused to reinstate the travel ban, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the supreme court. [nl1n1ir1fy] although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries compared with last years’ averages, iraqis in april received 349 immigrant visas, which are typically given to those with jobs or family members in the united states, compared with 305 in an average month in 2016. syrians also received more immigrant visas in april   268 versus an average of 219 per month last year. all other countries targeted by one of trump’s bans received fewer immigrant visas in april than in an average month last year.

" the u.s. state department on thursday said it had belatedly begun informing congress and others about groups associated with the russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on russia. the countering america’s adversaries through sanctions act, which became law on aug. 2, among other things imposes sanctions on russia to punish moscow because u.s. intelligence agencies concluded russia carried out a hacking and propaganda campaign to meddle in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.  the law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone  he identifies as having engaged “in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors” of the russian government. the law required the trump administration to “specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors” of the russian government by oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has now authorized the state department to identify such people or entities, state department spokeswoman heather nauert told reporters. she said notification to congress, as well as to industry, allies and partners, had begun and that public guidance on the matter would posted on the agency’s website soon, although she suggested this would not happen on thursday. “we expect to post the full public guidance on state.gov shortly ... a lot of these conversations are still ongoing between congress, industry, allies and also partners,” nauert said at a briefing. senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker this week said he wanted administration answers about why it failed to meet the deadline for implementing the sanctions on russia. however, he said he spoke to deputy secretary of state john sullivan by phone on thursday and afterward said in a statement that the department’s guidance “is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation.”    ",0
" mexico must be ready to respond immediately with its own tax measures if the incoming administration of president elect donald trump imposes a border tax, the economy minister said on friday, warning such protectionism may trigger a global recession.  trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has promised a “major border tax” on companies that shift jobs outside the united states, and such a measure could hobble mexico’s exports to its top trading partner. “it is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,” economy minister ildefonso guajardo said in an interview on mexican television.  “and it is very clear how   take a fiscal action that clearly neutralizes it,” he said.  trump has repeatedly attacked mexico over trade, jobs and immigration since he first launched his run for the white house in 2015, driving the peso currency to historic lows and unnerving investors, especially in the auto sector.  guajardo said trump’s proposed tax “was a problem for the entire world” and that it “would have a wave of impacts that could take us into a global recession.”  nonetheless, the minister said he expected foreign direct investment in mexico this year to total around $25 billion, with investment in the energy and telecommunications sectors expected to more than make up for the loss of a planned $1.6 billion ford motor co. (f.n) factory that the company said this month it is cancelling. trump had strongly criticized the plan, but ford said its decision was not the result of pressure from trump. guajardo also praised the government of japan and toyota motor corp (7203.t) for their “reasonable” response to trump’s threat to impose a significant border tax if the company does not stop making its corolla model in mexico for the u.s. market. toyota said last week the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in mexico.  “toyota has 10 plants in the united states... and employs more than 130,000 americans. if i were mr. trump, i’d treat them with more respect,” guajardo said. he added that he expects total foreign direct investment during the six year term of president enrique pena nieto, which ends in late 2018, to average $30 billion annually. guajardo has previously warned that u.s. corporate tax cuts proposed by trump, as well as the border tax, could undermine foreign investment in latin america’s no. 2 economy. mexico slapped a tax on u.s. high fructose corn syrup in the early 2000s after the united states refused to allow free trade in mexican sugar.

" scott pruitt, donald trump’s pick to head the u.s. environmental protection agency, has fought president barack obama’s measures to curb climate change at every turn as attorney general of oklahoma. now he is hoping to take apart obama’s environmental legacy from the inside out, a task that could prove tougher than it sounds. legal experts and former epa officials said pruitt could score some early easy wins in january, killing regulations the obama administration rushed through during his final months in office, such as the agency’s rule to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. that is because a little used law called the congressional review act allows congress to erase such ‘midnight’ rules with a simple majority vote, something that should come easily in the republican controlled congress. but regulations that have been on the books for longer, most of those obama ushered through during his two four year terms, will be more difficult to reverse, experts on both sides of the political divide said. for these regulations, which include the clean power plan that requires states to cut carbon output, along with vehicle emissions standards, pruitt will have just a handful of options, none of them easy, and nearly all of them triggering drawn out legal battles against well funded environmental groups and attorneys general from democratic party controlled states. the outcomes of these battles will have broad impacts on american industry, air and water quality, and the country’s role in global climate change, which an overwhelming majority of scientists say is causing sea level rise, increased droughts, and more frequent violent storms. republican trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to free up drilling and coal mining, something he said was possible without compromising air and water quality. he vowed that within his first 100 days in office he would rescind obama’s clean power plan, eliminate “unwarranted restrictions” on hydraulic fracturing oil drilling technology, cut “outdated” regulations, and pull the country out of a global pact to curb warming of the planet. trump’s transition team named pruitt as his pick to lead the epa on thursday, cheering industry and enraging green groups – both sides citing the 48 year old lawyer’s repeated lawsuits against the agency he now seems destined to lead. pruitt did not respond to requests for comment. one of the first categories of established epa regulation that pruitt may target are those that are already being challenged in court: the clean power plan and the waters of the united states act, which expands the number of waterways that are federally protected. as state prosecutor in oil  and gas producing oklahoma, pruitt joined coordinated legal efforts by states to block these rules, calling them examples of federal overreach. as head of the epa, pruitt will likely try to take the simple step of halting the epa’s defense of these regulations. jody freeman, a law professor at harvard university, said such a move could create complications for the epa, however, as it may be required legally to explain and support the change in direction. and even if the epa was able to withdraw its defense for the rules, other interested parties, including state governments and businesses, could intervene to defend them   raising the specter of a lengthy court battle. new york attorney general eric schneiderman said he is “leading a coalition of states that is already aggressively fighting back against efforts to reverse the progress this country has made in combating climate change over the past eight years.” california governor jerry brown’s top aide nancy mcfadden said california will “stand our ground” against attempts to gut epa rules. another option pruitt could take would be to challenge the very basis upon which obama’s epa created many of its climate change focused regulations: its finding that carbon dioxide endangers public health. successfully overturning the so called “endangerment finding” would remove the foundation upon which most of the administration’s clean air regulations were based, experts said. but doing so would be hard given the volumes of scientific research that support it, and the requirement to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous. the effort would likely also trigger lawsuits. the dc circuit court of appeals, which hears all cases challenging federal clean air rules, has been supportive of the scientific evidence for manmade climate change. “i do think that the new administration will have to expend substantial effort for a rule that rolls back or repeals the endangerment finding to withstand legal challenges,” said megan berge, a lawyer for baker botts who represents power companies. david doniger, a lawyer for the natural resources defense council, said he believed “there is no chance you could get either the dc circuit, or supreme court, to find that co2 and other pollutants don’t endanger public welfare and health.”  bob perciasepe, former deputy epa administrator under obama, said challenging the endangerment finding would have to be done through the administrative procedures act, which outlines a long process of gathering and considering public feedback. pruitt could also try to undo the existing regulations using the same steps obama’s epa used for adopting them, legal experts and former government officials said. but that is a months long process of proposal, public engagement and public comment that would lead to heated debate and potential litigation.  perhaps easiest would be to slash staff and reduce the agency’s funding, making it powerless to enforce its own rules. in this case, as with the others, pruitt seems likely to be taken to court. “i stand ready to use the full power of my office to compel their enforcement by the agency,” said new york’s schneiderman. susan dudley, a top regulatory official under president george w. bush, who also attempted to shrink epa regulation, said campaign promises to gut the government bureaucracy can be tough to fulfill.   “none of those initiatives has

" hundreds of stranded tourists and puerto ricans seeking to leave filled the sweltering halls of san juan international airport on monday anxious for a seat on one of the few flights operating after hurricane maria devastated power and communications across the island. fearful of checking out of hotels in case they could not get on the few flights available, worried visitors waited in long lines at puerto rico s main airport, struggling to reach loved ones and airlines by phone.  everything is hearsay at the moment because there is no communication,  said 31 year old rene kessler, a medical student from baltimore, maryland, preparing to spend the night in the terminal ahead of what he hoped would be a flight home. a microcosm of the storm battered island, san juan airport is a top priority in efforts by puerto rico s cash strapped government to rebuild after maria. experts say the work will take months and likely cost tens of billions of dollars. the screens above american airlines  desks were dark, while jetblue s displays flowed with red rows of cancellations. staff called out the names of passengers who won seats on the few departing planes.  everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out,  said leyla colon, standing in line with her 4 year old daughter at the jetblue terminal. without internet or cell service, she was unable to buy tickets before reaching the airport.  at this point i ll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here,  colon said. carriers said downed infrastructure had caused operations to be scaled back sharply. in some cases, airlines used a nearby hospital to print flight manifests. and some customers were given handwritten boarding passes. mike henderson, a construction firm superintendent, was trying to return to his family in detroit after his wife paid $2,000 dollars for a seat on a delta flight. but airline staff were unable to tell him if he was on the passenger list, he said.  i m drained,  henderson said with a sigh. airlines on sunday were restricted to one or two flights a day, and transportation security administration workers manually inspected bags and patted down passengers.  outside the airport, rows of diesel generators roared in the heat. they have been life savers but have had their side effects too. miguel gonzalez, 42, said he was at the airport to get his asthmatic mother a flight to florida. he was hospitalized for two weeks due to fumes from neighbors  generators that were fired up after hurricane irma hit the island early in september.  maria dealt an even heavier blow to local infrastructure, putting immense pressure on medical services. jessica negron, a resident of orlando, florida, said she had been in the airport since friday waiting for a frontier flight.  they keep changing the story,  she said. nearby, eating canned peaches with a plastic knife, were allyson and marcus singletary from georgia. they said the storm and airport chaos had ruined their anniversary trip.  this is the vacation from hell,  said allyson, 31.  this is  the walking dead  without zombies.

" new jersey governor chris christie, an early supporter of u.s. president elect donald trump, is considering a run to lead the republican national committee, politico reported on thursday. reuters could not immediately confirm the report, and representatives for christie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  christie, whose term as governor ends in january 2018, had been leading trump’s transition team until u.s. vice president elect mike pence recently took over earlier this month. current rnc chairman reince priebus has been tapped to serve as trump’s chief of staff when he starts his white house term jan. 20, 2017. christie had launched a presidential bid alongside trump in a pool of 17 candidates that eventually saw trump, a new york businessman who had never held political office, win the nomination as well as the nov. 8 presidential election over democrat hillary clinton.  christie had been a rising political star before the so called “bridgegate” scandal involving his former top aides that left his reputation in tatters.   pence took over from christie, who at one time had been considered a possible candidate to serve as trump’s attorney general, a post that instead went to u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama. trump’s team has said christie would remain as vice chair of the transition effort. earlier this month, christie’s two former aides were convicted for shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge in 2013, creating a days long traffic jam. the scheme was intended to punish the town’s mayor, a democrat, for declining to endorse christie’s reelection campaign.

" u.s. state department investigators last year issued a subpoena to the bill, hillary and chelsea clinton foundation seeking documents about projects run by the charity that may have required u.s. government approval when hillary clinton was secretary of state, the washington post reported on thursday. a u.s. official said the matter was being investigated by the inspector general, the state department’s internal watchdog. citing unnamed sources for the report, the post said the subpoena issued in the fall also asked for records related to senior clinton aide huma abedin, who for six months in 2012 simultaneously worked for several employers including the state department, the foundation, and clinton’s personal office. the report follows a reuters investigation last year that found the clinton foundation’s flagship health project did not submit new or increased payments from at least seven foreign governments to the state department for review, in breach of the ethics agreement clinton signed with the incoming obama administration in order to become secretary of state. clinton, who is running for the democratic nomination in the nov. 8 presidential election, has been criticized for using a private email account hosted on a private computer while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a matter the fbi is investigating. spokesmen for clinton’s campaign and the clinton foundation and a lawyer for abedin did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment. a spokesman for the inspector general also declined to comment. the post quoted an unnamed foundation representative as saying the initial document request had been narrowed by investigators and that the foundation was not the focus of the probe. it said there was no indication that the investigators were looking at clinton. “the full scope and status of the inquiry, conducted by the state department’s inspector general, were not clear from the material correspondence reviewed by the washington post,” the paper said. sources familiar with investigations into the controversy surrounding clinton’s private email server said they had no reason to believe any government agency was conducting any kind of inquiry into possible criminal violations related to the former secretary of state.

" u.s. government officials declined on tuesday to characterize the treatment of myanmar s rohingya muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions washington is considering to address the crisis.  i m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that i ve seen during a long career,  mark storella deputy assistant secretary of state from the bureau of population, refugees and migration said at a senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims have fled myanmar s rakhine state since security forces responded to rohingya militants  attacks on aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the united nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. myanmar, also known as burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat  terrorists  who killed civilians. but it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. many u.s. lawmakers have clamored for a strong u.s. response to the crisis and criticized government leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in washington, for failing to do more.  she s an impressive person, but she s not taking on the challenge,  said senator ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee. cardin said he considered the treatment of the rohingya genocide. the state department said on monday that washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over myanmar s treatment of the rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its global magnitsky law. [l2n1mz01t] at the foreign relations committee hearing, patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the u.s. government s ability to influence the myanmar government to change.

" a blockade of yemen s key ports appeared to have been broken on wednesday as ships arrived with food and fuel for the desperate population, the head of the norwegian refugee council (nrc), an humanitarian aid agency, told reuters. a saudi led military coalition fighting the armed houthi movement in yemen has blockaded yemeni ports since nov. 6, after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh.  although it later eased the restrictions by allowing u.n. flights and aid ships, that has not changed yemen s dire situation much. about 8 million people are on the brink of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.  today for the first time (there was) a little glimmer of hope... the first commercial goods have arrived in port, and the first ships that were let through this iron grip,  nrc chief jan egeland said. egeland said the first food and fuel had arrived in the key ports of hodeidah and saleef, but it remained a trickle compared to what was needed, since yemen s population of 27 million is almost entirely reliant on imports for food, fuel and medicine.  we need a lot of ships every single day and now we ve had months with no ships, so i still fear the famine, i still fear starvation, i still fear epidemic disease in new areas.   citing information from the u.n. led logistics cluster of aid agencies, egeland said three vessels had berthed at hodeidah with 87,000 tonnes of food, and one with 38,000 of food had arrived at the anchorage area of saleef port.  there were seven other vessels with more than 177,000 tonnes of food waiting to enter hodeidah anchorage area, as well as three vessels with 52,000 tonnes of fuel.

" as president donald trump delivered his inaugural address on capitol hill in january, his incoming national security adviser michael flynn, sitting a few yards away, texted a former business partner that a nuclear power project that would require lifting sanctions on russia was “good to go,” a senior house democrat said in a letter released on wednesday.     quoting a confidential informant, representative elijah cummings, the top democrat on the house oversight and government reform committee, wrote that alex copson, the managing partner of acu strategic partners, told the informant that flynn would see that the sanctions on moscow were “ripped up.” in the letter to representative trey gowdy, the panel’s republican chairman, cummings demanded that gowdy subpoena documents on the nuclear power plan from the white house, flynn, copson, their partners and associates. cummings said he had found the unnamed informant to be “authentic, credible, and reliable,” and offered to produce the individual for gowdy. reuters was unable to identify the informant or independently confirm the information in cummings' letter, which can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2avwkex. gowdy told reporters later on wednesday that he was not  going to have the oversight committee look into the issues raised in cummings letter, because it falls outside the scope of the committee’s responsibilities. he suggested the house intelligence committee, which is investigating russia’s role in the 2016 u.s. election, take up the matter. copson and acu did not immediately respond to detailed requests for comment, while an attorney for flynn declined to comment.  the white house referred inquiries to trump’s personal white house attorney, ty cobb, who declined to comment. if true, the informant’s story adds new evidence that the project’s promoters believed that flynn and trump backed the plan for a consortium of u.s., russian and french firms to build and operate 45 nuclear power plants in saudi arabia and other arab countries. reuters last week published documents that showed copson and other plan proponents believed they had flynn and trump in their corner. the documents also revealed previously unreported aspects of the acu proposal, including the involvement of a russian nuclear equipment manufacturer currently under u.s. sanctions. flynn was a consultant to acu from april 2015 to june 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in august 2017. flynn, who served only 24 days as trump’s national security adviser, pleaded guilty last week to lying to fbi agents working for special counsel robert mueller about his contacts with a senior russian diplomat. mueller is investigating whether the trump campaign colluded with russia during the 2016 elections. cummings wrote that he delayed releasing the letter at mueller’s request until the special counsel “completed certain investigative steps. they have now informed us that they have done so.”  cummings said the informant, who contacted his staff in  june, met copson at a jan. 20 inaugural event in washington.  the two had not known each other, cummings said. copson described the nuclear project and told the informant that he had “just got this text message” from flynn saying that the plan was “good to go” and that copson should contact his colleagues to “let them know to put things in place,” cummings wrote. copson showed the informant the text message, according to cummings. while the informant did not read the message, he saw the time stamp of 12:11 pm, which was about 10 minutes into trump’s inaugural address. “mike has been putting everything in place for us,” copson told the informant, cummings wrote. “this is going to make a lot of wealthy people.” “the whistleblower was extremely uncomfortable with the conversation,” cummings wrote. “while at the event, the whistleblower made brief notes of mr. copson’s name and the discussion. the whistleblower left the event shortly thereafter.” ",0
" work to avert the problems caused by climate change should not be a partisan issue, outgoing secretary of state john kerry told students at an elite u.s. engineering school on monday, in one of his final speeches as the nation’s top diplomat. kerry noted u.s. officials from military and intelligence leaders to the mayors of coastal cities agree the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall is one that they want to take action on, and he urged the incoming administration of republican president elect donald trump to tackle head on. trump, a new york real estate developer who has never held elected office, has described climate change as a hoax and vowed to pull the united states out of the deal negotiated in paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. but in an interview with the new york times in november, trump said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord. “i’m not going to speculate about the policies that our president elect and his secretary of state will choose to pursue, but i will tell you this ... some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” kerry said at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge.  “the truth is that climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. it’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation.” the u.s. senate this week is due to begin the process of confirming trump’s political appointments, including proposed environmental protection agency chief scott pruitt, the attorney general of oklahoma, who has repeatedly challenged the agency’s authority in the courts. many republicans in congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, both expected to be top priorities for the trump administration. kerry referenced a u.s. intelligence report published on monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. obama on monday echoed the message in an article published in science magazine.  kerry called on researchers and students at mit to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies. “it’s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders ... who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,” kerry said. “every person in this room – indeed, every person on the planet – has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible.” ",0
" colombia’s peace deal with the marxist farc rebel group will bring more investment to the country, backed partly by new donor aid and loans from multilateral development banks, u.s. treasury secretary jack lew and his colombian counterpart said on wednesday.     lew told a news conference in bogota that the peace accord, signed on monday and set to be voted on by the colombian people on sunday, would add to the confidence of foreign investors in colombia. the 52 year war killed 220,000 people and left millions displaced.     “implementing the agreement, showing that colombia has a stable future, i think will make colombia a more attractive place for foreign investment,” lew said after meeting with colombian finance minister mauricio cardenas and president juan manuel santos.      he said santos’ government already had an “excellent reputation” among foreign investors for sound management of fiscal policy and pursuit of economic reforms, despite major challenges from low oil prices. cardenas said the peace accord would attract both domestic and foreign investment and spur new spending on infrastructure and schools in former conflict areas. he declined to specify amounts but previously estimated that peace with farc could boost colombia’s economic growth by 1 percentage point annually.      “it will be at the initial stages, more tourism. that’s one of the areas we think the agreement will have the most direct and immediate impact,” cardenas said. “we will be able also to secure additional funding through cooperation, donors and lending by multilaterals to support expenditures and investments in the rural communities where the conflict was most acute.”     former farc fighters are already making plans for eco tourism ventures and cheesemaking operations in vast jungles largely untouched for decades. the peace deal gives farc a voice in colombia’s political process. cardenas said that put the group “in the competition for ideas” but would not alter the center right government’s economic reform plan, “which thinks that one of the pillars of the success of any country is having low inflation, low fiscal deficit, low debt, and at the same time having a progressive agenda.”          lew said the united states was still committed to providing bilateral aid to colombia and that he and cardenas discussed opportunities to gain support from multilateral institutions such as the international monetary fund, world bank and inter american development bank.

" the u.n. refugee agency on wednesday welcomed a decision by libya to open a transit center for unaccompanied children and other vulnerable refugees from among hundreds of thousands of migrants, and called on eu countries and others to accept them. reports this month of white libyan slave traders selling black african migrants at markets in libya   a grim echo of the trans saharan slave trade in centuries past   have drawn worldwide horror and condemnation. hundreds of thousands of migrants have been crossing the sahara and the mediterranean to reach europe through libya in each of the past several years. thousands die during crossing the desert and at sea. many are now being held in camps in libya in conditions rights groups describe as inhumane. the international organization for migration (iom) has flown 13,000 migrants from libya back to their countries of origin this year under a voluntary repatriation program. but thousands of others who face war or persecution at home cannot be sent back safely. the united nations high commissioner for refugees has been seeking to open a refugee transit center in tripoli to resettle or evacuate as many as 5,000 of the most vulnerable out of libya each year.  unhcr...welcomes the decision by the libyan authorities to set up a  transit and departure facility  in tripoli for people in need of international protection,  the geneva based agency said in a statement on wednesday. with support from the italian government, the initiative will facilitate the transfer of thousands of vulnerable refugees to third countries, it said.  but we now need eu member states and others to step up with offers of resettlement places and other solutions, including family reunification slots,  said roberto mignone, unhcr representative to libya. the goal is to speed up the process of securing places in third countries, particularly for unaccompanied and separated children and women at risk, it said. william lacy swing, head of the iom, told the u.n. security council on tuesday that it was working with partners  to try to empty the detention centers  in libya of around 15,000 migrants. nigeria s president said on wednesday the government had started bringing stranded citizens home from libya after the global outcry over reports that migrants there were being sold into slavery.

" egypt s security forces suffered one of their heaviest attacks after militants firing rockets and detonating explosives hit a police operation on friday in the western desert, authorities and security sources said on saturday. three security sources said at least 52 police officers and conscripts had been killed in gun battles that erupted in the remote desert, but egyptian authorities said only 16 men had died when their patrol came under attack.  egyptian authorities on saturday said two police operations were moving in on a suspected militant hideout on friday when one of the patrols came under fire from heavy weapons in a remote area around 135 km southwest of cairo. the interior ministry said 16 police were killed in that part of the operation, and 13 more were wounded. at least 15 militants were also killed in the gun fight. the statement did not give details on any casualties in the other police patrol.  as soon as the first mission approached the location of the terrorist elements, they sensed the arrival of the forces and targeted them using heavy weapons from all directions,  the interior ministry said in a statement. one security source said the convoy was attacked from higher ground by militants firing rocket propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices on the ground. security has been a key point for president abdel fattah al sisi, a former military commander who presents himself as a bulwark against terrorism after leading the ouster of president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in 2013. sisi was elected on a landslide a year later. though he has yet to declare his intentions, sisi is widely expected to run for re election in april next year with little opposition. but critics say his popularity has been dimmed because of security and economic austerity policies.   no group made any claim or statement about friday s operation not far from the capital. but most of the fighting so far between militants and security forces has been in northern sinai, where an islamic state affiliate operates. security sources earlier said the police had been hunting hideout of the hasm movement, an islamist militant group blamed for attacks on judges and police around the capital. that group has in the past only carried out mostly small operations since it emerged last year. egyptian authorities say it is the armed militant wing of the muslim brotherhood, an islamist group it outlawed in 2013. most of its leadership has been jailed in a crackdown under sisi. since sisi came to power, hundreds of troops and police have been killed in often sophisticated attacks by militants in the northern sinai region, where ansar bayt al maqdis group pledged allegiance to islamic state in 2014. last sunday, at least 24 militants and six soldiers were killed in attacks on military outposts in north sinai, when more than 100 militants repeatedly attacked security outposts south of the border town of sheikh zuweid. attacks have mostly hit police and armed forces, but militants have also extended their campaign outside the sinai, targeting egypt s christians with bomb attacks on churches in cairo and other cities.

" saddled with the toughest job in american diplomacy, the chief u.s. negotiator with north korea stands between a u.s. president who insists he doesn t want to talk and an enemy who shows no interest in listening. while veteran state department asia hand joseph yun might be washington s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a  devastating war on the korean peninsula, he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle pyongyang.   on the other side, north korea s young leader, kim jong un,  shows little interest in negotiating either, at least not until he has developed a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland. despite the daunting obstacles, south korean born yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand off, according to reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former u.s. officials and south korean diplomats. most were deeply skeptical about his chances.    he s such a dreamer,  a white house official said, with a note of sarcasm.    we don t think this is going anywhere,  said another u.s. official, although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the north koreans as long as yun does not appear to be undermining president donald trump s public rejection of direct negotiations. trump has told aides that his military threats will drive north korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs, four white house officials said, a view not shared among most u.s. intelligence agencies. yun, however, is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with north korean officials at the united nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of u.s. citizens, a senior state department official told reuters this week. in june, he secured the release of u.s. student otto warmbier, who returned to the united states in a coma and died days later.  trump headed to asia on friday as a senior aide warned the world is  running out of time  on the north korea crisis. behind the scenes, yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict. further aggravating tensions, two u.s. strategic bombers conducted drills over south korea on thursday. that followed word from south korea s spy agency that north korea may be preparing another missile launch. u.s. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks. in the midst of this is yun, a soft spoken, 32 year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago, near the end of the obama administration. he is grappling with trump s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president s top aides over whether saber rattling will force kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be, according to several u.s. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.  concern about yun s difficulties has surfaced in seoul, where he visits regularly and where trump will travel next week on the second stop of his asian tour. several south korean officials expressed worry that yun s diplomatic efforts with north korea lack any real underpinning of support from the white house.    things are clearly not easy for him,  one south korean diplomat said.  yun is precisely that person (to talk to north korea), but trump is killing the whole process.  secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters on sept. 30 the united states was probing for a diplomatic opening, only to be slapped down by trump, who told him via twitter this was a waste of time. at the same time, cia director mike pompeo, who regularly briefs trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on north korea in the president s inner circle, has apparently gained stature.    several officials familiar with those discussions say pompeo is feeding trump assessments that u.s. military threats will force kim to bow to u.s. demands for nuclear disarmament, a position that some u.s. intelligence officers privately contest.  the cia declined comment. a u.s. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said yun  has become diplomatically  untethered,  not fully connected to a core u.s. approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy.   the one tangible achievement of yun s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of 22 year old warmbier in secret talks with north korean officials in oslo and new york. yun flew to pyongyang in june to medically evacuate warmbier. when choe son hui, head of the north korean foreign ministry s north america bureau, met yun in oslo, she was unaware of how serious warmbier s condition was, a source in washington knowledgeable about the matter said.  but once she learned about it she was  shocked  and yun was summoned urgently to meet a north korean diplomat in new york, which quickly led to warmbier s return home, the source said. warmbier s death complicated yun s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of u.s. north korean contacts around that time, the state department official said.  despite trump s threats of military action against pyongyang, the state department official said yun s view was  the less you engage diplomatically, the more likely you are in the dark.  even so, trump s rhetoric has raised questions among allies, and possibly even in north korea, about how serious, if at all, his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate yun may have to pursue it.    trump  personalized  the conflict   deriding kim as  little rocket man     against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts, some of whom warned it could be counterproductive, a senior national security official said.   another official pointed out, however, that trump, who in may said he would be honored to meet kim, had not hurled any fresh insults at kim in recent days, raising hopes for an altered approach. a south korean official in seoul said it was necessary for washington to have someone in contact with north korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold. but trump s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, told japan s nhk television this week:  what we cannot afford to do is enter into these long, drawn out negotiations that allow north korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs.  former u.s. negotiators sympathize with yun, whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug of war between a white house breathing fire and a state department pushing a peaceful solution.  nobody doubted my authority,  said wendy sherman, one of the lead u.s. negotiators who achieved the 2015 deal under which iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.  all of this undermines our ability to do the job.  robert gallucci, who was chief u.s. negotiator during the north korean nuclear crisis of 1994 and has had recent contact with yun, said the envoy is  realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere, including the tone set by the president, but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism.

" roger stone, a longtime ally of president donald trump, said on thursday he had agreed to testify in a closed hearing to the house of representatives intelligence committee in its investigation of possible russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “all 20 members of the committee will be present for the hearing,” stone, an informal adviser to the republican president, said in a statement. the hearing will be held on sept. 26. stone said he had asked for an open, public hearing in the interest of full transparency. since it will be closed, he has requested an immediate release of transcripts to avoid confusion about his testimony. “i very much look forward to testifying and i am anxious to correct a number of the misstatements by committee members regarding my activities in 2016,” stone said. a spokeswoman for representative mike conaway, the republican in charge of the committee investigation, declined comment. the house panel is one of the main congressional committees investigating allegations that russia sought to interfere in the 2016 u.s. election and probing whether any trump associates colluded with moscow. russia denies any such efforts, and trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. media reports earlier this year said that stone was among trump associates whose communications and financial transactions were being examined by the federal bureau of investigation and others as part of the broad investigation. at the time, stone denied contacts or collusion with the russians.

" a cameroonian journalist jailed for over two years for contact with islamist militant group boko haram is set to be freed after a court on thursday shortened his sentence, his lawyer said.  radio france internationale reporter ahmed abba was arrested in july 2015 and sentenced in april this year to 10 years on terrorism charges that rights groups denounced as a sham. authorities said they found evidence on abba s computer of  attacks planned by boko haram, whose islamist insurgency in nigeria, cameroon and neighboring countries has cost the lives of at least 20,000 people since 2009.   abba has denied knowledge of attacks and protested his innocence. the sentence was reduced to two years on thursday when an appeals court dropped the terrorism charges but upheld less serious charges of  non denunciation  of terrorism.   technically, mr. ahmed can be outside today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,  given that he has already been in jail for over two years, his lawyer charles tchoungang told reuters. abba s forthcoming release comes amid a crackdown on dissent by president paul biya who is seeking to extend his 35 year rule in elections next year. the government is confronting a growing separatist insurgency in the country s anglophone regions as well as the threat from boko haram.  patrice nganang, a prize winning cameroonian author who lives in new york, was arrested during a visit to cameroon this month for writing a facebook post critical of biya. nganang is being held in jail until court proceedings next month.  rights groups and rfi welcomed thursday s ruling.   this ruling is a victory for ahmed abba who has been detained for more than two years simply for doing his job as a journalist,  said amnesty international researcher ilaria allegrozzi.

" u.s. senate democrats would not agree to postponing completion of this year’s spending legislation until 2017, the chamber’s top democrat said on thursday, warning the majority republicans against considering such an approach when congress returns next week. senate minority leader harry reid spoke after some conservative groups outside congress earlier this week said it would be better for lawmakers not to finish a government appropriations bills until early 2017, when there will be a new president who could work out a deal with a newly elected congress. the lawmakers return to work next week from a lengthy recess with appropriations bills unfinished for the coming fiscal year, which starts oct. 1. by law, lawmakers must act by sept. 30 to approve the spending bills, or the government shuts down, as it did for two weeks in 2013 when appropriations bills had not been enacted in time. in a conference call with reporters, reid said he worried that “we’re headed straight for another unnecessary government shutdown” unless action is taken.  congress could pass a stop gap continuing resolution that would keep the government running at current spending levels until next year, postponing final appropriations decisions until then without shutting down the government. reid said democrats favored approving a shorter stop gap bill that would let lawmakers return to washington later this year   presumably after the nov. 8 election   to finish spending bills. “but we are not doing anything into next year,” he said. “and the republicans should be made aware of that right now.”  reid said he had met with president barack obama on wednesday, implying obama endorsed his stance. although democrats are in the minority in both the senate and house, rules requiring a supermajority for many senate actions give democrats significant leverage. more than two dozen conservative groups wrote to lawmakers this week saying they were worried that congress would use what is called a “lame duck” session immediately after the election to tack on additional spending and corporate welfare provisions to the appropriations bills. among other things, congress has not been able to decide how much to spend to fight the mosquito borne zika virus. the republican leadership has not announced its plans for finishing work on spending bills. staff members for both republican leaders in the house and senate said they would discuss the issue next week.

" democrats beat republicans in u.s. television ratings, according to nielsen data released on tuesday for the first night of the democratic national convention. an estimated 26 million people watched monday evening  between 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. eastern time, when first lady michelle obama and senator bernie sanders were among the key speakers, nielsen said. the data represents people watching across seven broadcast and cable tv networks.  the total is about three million more tv eyes than for the first night of the republican convention last week when white house contender donald trump’s wife melania was the keynote speaker. all in all, some 23 million americans watched the first night of the republican convention last week   in line with the audience for the 2012 gathering. trump’s big acceptance speech on thursday night last week, however, failed to deliver the record audiences many tv executives had been expecting. in 2012, the democratic convention generally drew more nightly tv viewers than the republican gathering, when mitt romney was running for the white house.

" the clinton foundation, the family philanthropy of democratic u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton, should shut down or transfer operations to another charity despite its good work to avoid perceptions of “pay for play,” the washington post and usa today said in editorials on wednesday.  despite plans announced earlier this week to reorganize the clinton foundation if hillary clinton wins the nov. 8 election, usa today said the global charity must close for the democratic candidate to avoid any appearance of unethical ties.  “the only way to eliminate the odor surrounding the foundation is to wind it down and put it in mothballs, starting today, and transfer its important charitable work to another large american charity such as the bill & melinda gates foundation,” the paper’s editorial board wrote.   the gates foundation declined to share its thoughts on the idea. “we really can’t speculate about the future of the clinton foundation,” amy enright, a gates foundation spokeswoman, wrote in an email. the newspaper also published an editorial by donna shalala, the clinton foundation’s president, in which she argued that the foundation helps millions of people, especially in developing countries, and so scaling down its work was not simple. “this suggestion ignores how global philanthropy works, and the reality that there are human beings around the world who would be affected by these decisions,” shalala wrote. the foundation announced on monday that it would stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if clinton wins the presidency and that her husband, former president bill clinton, would resign from the foundation’s board. the washington post said in its editorial that these changes were insufficient and should have happened sooner, before hillary clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. “the foundation undoubtedly does worthwhile work,” the post’s editorial board wrote. “should ms. clinton win, all of that work and all of the foundation’s assets should be spun off to an organization with no ties to the first family.” the clintons’ daughter, chelsea clinton, remains on the board of the charity, the full name of which is the bill, hillary & chelsea clinton foundation. the call from two leading u.s. news organizations came as republican presidential candidate donald trump and other members of his party have taken to calling for a special prosecutor to investigate what they say is corruption. the clinton campaign has dismissed such calls as groundless political smears. republicans see attacking clinton over the organization as a way of unifying conservatives divided over trump, who has never held elected officer and who often deviates from conservative orthodoxy. democrats hope the controversy comes too late to make a difference in the election, in which most national public opinion polls show clinton ahead.  the foundation has said hillary clinton was not involved with the group while serving as the nation’s top diplomat. the clinton campaign denies clinton ever took any action because of donations to the foundation. clinton campaign manager robby mook told msnbc on wednesday that clinton does not have a conflict of interest with charitable work, and pointed to her rival’s business interests with wall street, china and russia. “donald trump and his bottom line and his networks are directly connected to all kinds of international entities ... and nobody’s asking him to disclose or divest,” mook said of the new york businessman. trump has responded by saying it is clinton, not he, who has close ties to russia.

" the partisan divide over the house intelligence committee’s probe of russian interference in the u.s. presidential election deepened on friday, when the committee’s top democrat suggested  its republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the white house. panel chairman devin nunes said he had to cancel next tuesday’s hearing with officials from former democratic president barack obama’s administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the national security agency and federal bureau of investigation. “the committee seeks additional information ... that can only be addressed in closed session,” representative nunes told reporters. fbi director james comey and nsa head admiral mike rogers testified at a public hearing on monday at which comey confirmed for the first time that the fbi is investigating possible ties between republican president donald trump’s campaign as moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. representative adam schiff, the intelligence committee’s top democrat, said the cancellation was not in the public interest. “i think that there must have been a very strong pushback from the white house about the nature of monday’s hearing. it’s hard for me to come to any other conclusion about why an agreed upon hearing would be suddenly canceled,” schiff told a separate news conference.  the scheduled witnesses, former director of national intelligence james clapper, former central intelligence agency director john brennan and former deputy attorney general sally yates, were in office when the purported hacking and disinformation by russia to influence the election took place. russia has denied allegations by u.s. intelligence agencies that it sought to influence the election, and trump, a republican, has said the controversy was cooked up by democrats and fanned by hostile media. nunes also said on friday that former trump campaign manager paul manafort’s lawyers told the committee that he is volunteering to be interviewed, and that the panel would work with his lawyers to decide whether the interview would be open or closed to the public. the new york times reported last month manafort was one of several trump advisers whose contacts with russian operatives were monitored by u.s. law enforcement and intelligence. manafort, who was trump’s campaign chairman for several months last year, dismissed the report, the newspaper said. many democrats, including schiff, have questioned whether a committee led by nunes, a close trump ally who served on the president’s transition team, can still be relied on to conduct a credible investigation. they have called for a special prosecutor or select committee. nunes apologized to the intelligence panel on thursday for announcing to the public and briefing trump that u.s. intelligence may have swept up communications by trump associates before telling the committee. schiff said democrats had no intention of giving up on the investigation. “from my point of view, that would be irresponsible of us. so, i think we’re going to do our best to investigate this regardless of the obstacles we’re encountering,” schiff said. trump, who in early march tweeted without giving evidence that obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against democrat hillary clinton, said he was “somewhat vindicated” by nunes’ statement about the surveillance.

" members of the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee are close to an agreement on how to overhaul a controversial national security agency surveillance program and hope to complete legislation soon, the top democrat on the panel said on wednesday. representative adam schiff said he had proposed a compromise that would let intelligence agencies query a database of information on americans in national security cases without a warrant, but would require a warrant to use the information in other cases, such as those involving serious violent crime. “this would prevent law enforcement from simply using the database as a vehicle to go fishing, but at the same time it would preserve the operational capabilities of the program,” schiff told reporters. at issue is section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, which allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states. u.s. intelligence officials consider section 702 among the most vital of tools at their disposal to thwart national security threats. but the program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former nsa contractor edward snowden, incidentally gathers communications of americans, such as when they compete with foreigners. currently, those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant. congress must renew section 702 in some form by dec. 31 or the program will expire. schiff said he believed the compromise would be acceptable to many lawmakers, as well as the intelligence community and the federal bureau of investigation. it is similar to legislation backed by the house judiciary committee. however, there are still deep divides in both the senate and the house over what to do about section 702, as lawmakers balance demands for more privacy protections with spy agencies’ desire to preserve what they see as a valuable tool. there are different renewal proposals in the house and senate. one senate bill would not require any warrants, which schiff said he did not think could pass the house. it was not clear whether lawmakers will vote on a standalone 702 bill or whether it would be part of a broader must pass bill, such as a spending measure congress must pass next month to keep the government open. another possibility would be a short term extension to keep the current surveillance system in place and give congress more time to come up with a solution that could become law.

" the kansas secretary of state and the american civil liberties union (aclu) have reached a temporary agreement over the state’s voter registration laws, keeping kansas’ chief elections officer from a contempt of court hearing, according to court documents filed on thursday. the deal between secretary of state kris kobach and the aclu comes six weeks before the u.s. presidential election. the two sides have been at odds over a kansas law requiring people to prove american citizenship if they want to register to vote while applying for a driver’s license. critics say this requirement disenfranchises voters, especially minorities. the deal will allow people who registered at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without providing citizenship documents to vote in the nov. 8 election with a standard ballot, rather than be forced to use a provisional one, the aclu and kobach said in a status report filed on thursday. kobach will also clarify his office’s website to help voters find information more easily, according to the report filed to u.s. district judge julie robinson.  robinson had ordered kobach, a republican, to explain by thursday why he should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a federal order issued in may.  that order required him to register people who applied to vote at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without proof of citizenship. robinson canceled the contempt hearing scheduled for friday, according to her own court filing, citing the aclu and kobach’s agreement.  “our case is ongoing, but this interim agreement is a critical victory for kansans who want to vote in the november election. it is a shame that voters had to fight so hard to get kris kobach to do his job,” aclu attorney orion danjuma said in a statement. kobach said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, but criticized the aclu.  “the aclu’s argument was weak at best. however, at this point the preparations for the november 8, 2016, general election must proceed with rules established to ensure the efficient administration of the election,” he said in a statement.  kansas’ law, among the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, is defended by republicans who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud.  on tuesday, a kansas state judge issued a separate ruling extending voting rights through the nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices.

" chiefs of the parties aiming to form germany s next government hope to agree the outlines of a coalition deal by the end of the week, they said on tuesday, after two smaller parties broke a logjam by dropping demands on tax and climate policy. with the three camps still divided on several issues, the pro business free democrats (fdp) offered ground by saying they would accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30 40 billion euros ($35 46 billion) of relief. the ecologist greens also offered a concession, saying they would no longer insist on fixed dates to shut down coal fired power stations and to ban cars with internal combustion engines. however, the christian social union (csu), the bavarian sister party of chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats (cdu) was skeptical about the concessions offered.  abandoning nonsense deadlines is hardly a compromise,  the csu s chief negotiator alexander dobrindt said after the conclusion of talks on tuesday. the three camps agreed to leave smaller expert groups to thrash out compromises on the areas dividing them this week, with top officials, having identified problem areas, only returning to the table on friday.  we are now switching to work mode,  michael kellner, a top green official. the three way coalition the parties are trying to form is untested at national level, and the negotiations follow a fracturing of the vote in a national election in september, when merkel s conservatives bled support to the far right. should the talks stall, berlin would face a lengthy period of uncertainty at a time when many in the european union are looking to germany, its biggest economy, for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to trans atlantic relations. merkel, who is seeking a fourth term, said on monday that immigration and climate policy were the most contentious topics in the exploratory talks, which she hopes to advance to full blown negotiations on nov. 16. there is broad support among her conservatives comprising the cdu and csu for tax reforms. the cdu/csu alliance also reached a deal on migrant policy last month. the main sticking point to a broader deal on that front is a conservative proposal to cap at 200,000 a year the number of migrants germany would accept on humanitarian grounds. the greens reject such a limit, which they say is unconstitutional. also complicating the path to a coalition deal, negotiators will need to seek approval from their parties before proceeding to full blown talks.  a crucial test will be a greens party conference on nov. 25, when party leaders will seek the blessing of their base. signaling a readiness to compromise, greens co leader simone peter told rheinische post newspaper:  for us, it doesn t matter if the last coal fired power station is off the grid in 2030 or 2032. that s where we are pragmatic.  but it was crucial to agree on further climate protection measures to cut germany s co2 emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, as merkel had promised. greens co leader cem ozdemir signaled readiness to compromise on car policy after an emissions scandal at germany s leading automaker volkswagen(vowg_p.de) plunged the industry into crisis.  it s clear to me that we alone cannot enforce the end date of 2030 for the approval of combustion engines,  ozdemir told stuttgarter zeitung and stuttgarter nachrichten newspapers.

" the u.s. government will pay u.s. health insurers who provide medicare advantage plans to elderly and disabled americans about 0.85 percent more on average in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting mostly stable medical costs, a government agency said on monday. the department of health and human services’ final plan to raise payments was a bit less than the 1.35 percent increase the agency proposed in february. it said the lower figure reflected revisions to medical services cost calculations. “the medicare advantage rates look very much in line with the proposed rule,” said ipsita smolinski of capitol street, a washington research firm. insurers including unitedhealth group inc, aetna inc and anthem inc manage health benefits for more than 17 million americans enrolled in medicare advantage plans. the other more than 30 million people eligible for medicare coverage are part of the government run fee for service program. shares in unitedhealth and aetna were slightly lower in very light after hours trading, while anthem was unchanged. each year, the government sets out how it will reimburse insurers for the healthcare services their members use. payments vary by region, the quality rating earned by the health plan and the relative health of the members. the proposal is always subject to industry lobbying and often changes before it is finalized.  analysts said that while that the lower than proposed payment was a slight negative for insurers, the agency made two other modifications in the final overall payment plan that would benefit the industry next year.  capital alpha partners analyst kim monk said the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the health agency division that regulates medicare, gave ground on two issues: a new method for calculating risk and cuts in payments for certain employer based retiree drug plans. the government agency, which initially planned to implement the cuts over a year, said on monday it now planned to introduce a two year transition period after hearing from insurers, unions, employers and lobbying groups that the cuts proposed in february were too aggressive. insurance lobbyist america’s health insurance plans president marilyn tavenner said in a statement the government had made changes to mitigate the negative impact of its original proposal, but that more could be done to improve the stability of the employer based retiree plans.

" an obscure trump campaign adviser pleaded guilty to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the campaign and moscow, said court documents released on monday. george papadopoulos, who joined the trump presidential campaign in march 2016, lied in january about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then republican presidential candidate donald trump and russian president vladimir putin, special counsel robert mueller said in the documents. the documents said an unidentified campaign official advised papadopoulos around may 2016 that trump himself “is not doing these trips” but that “it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” while not mentioned in the documents, top trump campaign advisers, including trump’s eldest son, donald trump jr.; his son in law, jared kushner; and campaign manager paul manafort met at trump tower in new york in june 2016 with russians claiming to have derogatory information on democratic rival hillary clinton. it was not known whether that meeting resulted from papadopoulos’ efforts. the special counsel said papadopoulos   a chicago based international energy lawyer   lied to federal bureau of investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that russia claimed to have “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” on clinton. prosecutors said papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined trump’s campaign. in fact, they said, papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders on monday played down papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer. “he asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she told a news briefing. “any actions that he took would have been on his own.” papadopoulos’ lawyers said in a statement it was “in the best interest of our client .... that we refrain from commenting on george’s case.”  the documents were released just after indictments charging manafort and business associate rick gates with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents. none of the charges against manafort and gates, however, directly relate to mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and what u.s. intelligence agencies concluded was a russian bid to boost trump’s candidacy. the prosecutors said papadopoulos had been emailing with a “campaign supervisor,” “senior policy adviser” and a “high ranking campaign official.” an official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and russia said the senate intelligence committee already had copies of an extensive file of trump campaign emails that included emails between papadopoulos and the campaign. one email shows manafort had been discussing papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange a trump visit to russia with at least one other campaign official. papadopoulos pleaded guilty on oct. 5, according to a court statement by mueller’s office. as part of a plea deal, papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” to fbi agents. “through his false statements and omissions, defendant papadopoulos impeded the fbi’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the campaign and the russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” a court document said. the fbi arrested papadopoulos on july 27 after he arrived at dulles international airport near washington. in an oct. 5 letter to the chicago man’s lawyer, mueller and his team noted that papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $9,500. but they agreed “to bring to the court’s attention at sentencing the defendant’s efforts to cooperate with the government” on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors, the document said. court documents said papadopoulos lied to the fbi shortly after trump’s jan. 20 inauguration, when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged russian government efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign. in addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor, prosecutors said papadopoulos mischaracterized his contacts with that individual as “inconsequential.” “in truth and in fact, however, defendant papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high level russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in moscow” before telling papadopoulos about the “dirt” on clinton, said the prosecutors. the prosecutors said papadopoulos also lied to the fbi in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in london with an unidentified russian woman with ties to senior russian officials occurred before the chicago man joined the campaign. the meeting took place on or about march 24, 2016, and the russian woman was introduced to papadopoulos as a relative of putin, although it turned out that she was not related to the russian leader, according to the documents. papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the russian woman to set up the putin meeting, and kept other trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts, they said. in one email, the documents said, the russian woman told papadopoulos that “the russian federation would love to welcome him (trump) once his candidature would be officially announced.” the prosecutors said that on or about march 31 papadopoulos attended a “national security meeting” in washington with then candidate trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers. when he introduced himself to the group, the prosecutors said, “he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate trump and president putin.” in mid april, the professor introduced papadopoulos via an email to an individual in moscow who the documents dubbed the russian mfa connection   mfa being the initials for the ministry of foreign affairs. the pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the “groundwork” for a trump putin meeting.

" president donald trump’s deputy national security adviser, k.t. mcfarland, is expected to step down and has been offered the position of u.s. ambassador to singapore, a u.s. official said on sunday. the move will be seen as a victory for trump’s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, who is retooling the national security team he inherited from retired lieutenant general michael flynn, who resigned as trump’s first national security adviser in february. mcfarland, 65, is a former national security analyst for fox news and was one of trump’s original hires after he won the presidential election on nov. 8. the exact date of her departure was unclear, said the u.s. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. news of her pending departure came less than a week after trump removed his chief strategist, steve bannon, from the national security council at mcmaster’s urging. bannon had a seat on the council’s “principals committee,” which included the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides. flynn was forced to resign on feb. 13 over his contacts with russia’s ambassador to the united states, sergey kislyak, before trump took office on jan. 20.  mcfarland’s expected departure will likely elevate the status of dina powell, who is deputy national security adviser for strategy. she had served in republican president george w. bush’s state department, and had advised trump’s daughter, ivanka trump, during trump’s transition to the presidency. trump’s white house has been rife with infighting and palace intrigue as the president has struggled to get past some early stumbles.

" minnesota’s democratic lieutenant governor tina smith was appointed as u.s. senator on wednesday to replace al franken, who resigned after being accused of sexual harassment. smith, 59, will serve a one year term concluding in january 2019, governor mark dayton said at a news conference, and will run in a special election for the seat in november next year. dayton said he listened to the views of many minnesotans before deciding on smith. “there is no one i trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office,” dayton said. “i know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.” smith told reporters at the news conference that she will be a fierce advocate on behalf of the state, pushing for economic opportunity and fairness. “this is a difficult moment for us but even now i am now filled with optimism,” she said. “though i never anticipated this moment, i am resolved to do everything i can to move minnesota forward.”  smith became lieutenant governor in january 2014. she previously worked as dayton’s chief of staff and held positions at general mills and planned parenthood. last week franken, 66, also a democrat, announced his resignation from the seat he has held since 2009. the former comedian has denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. reuters has not independently verified the accusations against him. during wednesday’s news conference, smith thanked franken for his service and called him a “champion” for the state. she said she respected his decision to resign. “sexual harassment is disrespectful to people and can’t be tolerated,” smith said. “i can promise you that i’ll be working on these issues when i get to washington, d.c.” smith will be an excellent senator, franken said. “her record of accomplishment as lieutenant governor demonstrates that she’ll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for minnesota,” franken said in a statement on wednesday. minnesota will soon have two women senators, as smith will join fellow democrat amy klobuchar, 57, who in 2006 became the state’s first female elected senator and was re elected in 2012. minnesota’s first female senator, muriel humphrey, was appointed in 1978 to fill the seat of her husband, hubert humphrey, following his death. the republican party of minnesota said smith will be entering office with what it called the “political baggage” of the dayton administration, as well as a “well established track record of far left policies.” “minnesota republicans look forward to electing a republican to the u.s. senate in 2018,” its chairwoman, jennifer carnahan, said in a statement.  the republican party’s slim majority in the u.s. senate will not be affected by the move to replace franken. democrats will gain a seat to cut republican’s majority in the 100 member senate to 51 after tuesday night’s victory by doug jones over republican candidate roy moore in a special election in alabama.

" lebanon has set a date of may 6 next year to hold its first legislative election in nearly a decade, potentially transforming the politics of a country caught in a confrontation between saudi arabia and iran. interior minister nohad machnouk signed a decree setting the date on friday, allowing the vote to go ahead at last. the election has been postponed three times since the last vote in 2009, with politicians citing security concerns, political crisis and a dispute over the election law. prime minister saad al hariri s coalition government, which took office a year ago, agreed on the new election law in june, but setting the date was held up while officials debated technical details and registered lebanese citizens abroad. lebanon s political landscape has shifted dramatically since the last election. hariri s pro western, saudi backed political alliance has split up. for the past year he has led a power sharing government which includes the heavily armed, iran backed shi ite movement hezbollah, despised by his saudi allies. hariri sparked a political crisis last month by announcing his resignation while in riyadh and denouncing hezbollah and iran. he stayed abroad for two weeks before returning, and finally withdrew his resignation last week. lebanon has a complex electoral system designed to maintain civil peace in a country where sunnis, shi ites, christians and druze fought numerous civil wars since independence in 1943. the 128 seat parliament includes 64 christians apportioned among seven denominations, and 64 muslims, including equal numbers of sunnis and shi ites. the country is divided into districts that each vote for multiple lawmakers according to strict religious quotas. the president must be a maronite christian, the prime minister a sunni muslim and the parliament speaker a shi ite muslim, representing the three biggest groups in parliament. the international community has repeatedly stressed the importance of lebanon holding timely elections to restore confidence in its institutions and maintain stability. machnouk said lebanese abroad would be able to vote on april 22 and 28.

" a democratic senator on monday prevented legislation from being quickly considered that would expand the fbi’s power to use secretive surveillance orders to obtain some internet records, arguing it would lead to a “dramatic erosion” of u.s. privacy rights.   senator ron wyden of oregon placed a hold on the annual intelligence authorization act, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the cia and other u.s. intelligence agencies. a provision of the authorization bill would allow the federal bureau of investigation to use national security letters, which do not require a warrant, to compel companies such as alphabet inc’s google and facebook to hand over certain internet records. these would include email metadata, some browsing history and social media log in information. such an expansion would allow the fbi to retrieve sensitive data of u.s. citizens without court approval, wyden said.  “convenience alone does not justify such a dramatic erosion of americans’ constitutional rights,” he said on the senate floor. national security letters are the latest flashpoint in a years long debate pitting u.s. surveillance operations against digital privacy interests. wyden’s objection blocks the senate from rapidly advancing the bill and now forces republican senate leader mitch mcconnell to go through normal order to hold a roll call vote, a process that can take days. currently, national security letters, or nsls, can only compel sharing of phone billing records, according to a 2008 legal memo written by the u.s. justice department. still, the fbi has used the letters since then to request internet records during national security investigations. senate republicans have attempted to advance the nsl expansion, which fbi director james comey has called his top legislative priority, several times in recent months. last week the senate came two votes short of advancing separate legislation that would have expanded national security letters. [ul1n19e0zy] though some republicans invoked the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando earlier this month to promote that measure, richard burr, the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee, said last week it was “one hundred percent correct” that it would not have prevented the massacre. wyden also said he opposed another provision of the authorization bill that would limit the jurisdiction of the privacy and civil liberties oversight board, a government advisory committee that reviews the legality and effectiveness u.s. surveillance programs.

" a truck carrying relief supplies for rohingya muslim refugees  skidded off a hilly road in bangladesh and plunged into a paddy field on thursday, killing nine people and injuring 10, police and aid workers said. the accident happened in a district near the myanmar border where refugees have been arriving since late last month to escape a myanmar military offensive against insurgents that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing.  six died on the spot while three died on the way to hospital,  a. k. m. jahangir, a senior official with the red crescent relief group, told reuters. some of the injured were in critical condition, he added. the dead and injured were laborers, traveling in the truck to help distribute the aid supplies. about 422,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered the myanmar army offensive in response. buddhist majority myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces are tackling rohingya terrorists.

" south korean president moon jae in comforted mourners in the small scenic city of jecheon on friday amid growing public anger at how fire ripped through an eight storey building, killing at least 29 people, most of them taking a sauna.  all but one of the victims had been identified by friday morning, including 20 women who were overcome by toxic fumes in the second floor sauna, jecheon fire chief lee sang min said.   our crew on the scene said the lockers inside the facility were installed like a labyrinth and it s a glass building with few windows, which apparently made way for the smoke from the first floor to quickly fill up the second floor,  lee told reporters. consoling family members, president moon jae in said he was devastated and promised a full investigation.  the government as a whole will thoroughly probe this accident s cause and process of response, and although after the fact, the investigation and measures will be such that, at least, there will not be lingering deep sorrow.  moon s predecessor, ousted former president park geun hye, was widely criticized for her slow and ineffective response to the sewol ferry tragedy in 2014 in which more than 300 people, mostly schoolchildren, drowned. anger mounted on friday at reports of shoddy construction, broken doors and other problems that may have contributed to the deaths.  one man shouted at officials visiting survivors in hospital, complaining that firefighters failed to break through to the trapped women in time. media reported that a glass door leading to the sauna had not been working properly for more than a month, and that emergency stairs were often used for storage.   nothing has changed even after the sewol tragedy,  parliament member ahn cheol soo said.  i just cannot understand why the same type of accidents happen over and over again,  he said, according to the yonhap news agency. jecheon s mayor told reporters the city was considering a mass funeral and planned to cover most of the costs. investigators were still trying to find out the cause of the conflagration, but were focusing on a first floor parking lot, lee said.  there were cars parked on the first floor, and as they were burning, a large amount of toxic gases were released.   tragic stories began to emerge as victims were identified. one man told yonhap that he lost his mother, wife, and daughter. another said he received a phone call from his trapped wife as she coughed in the gathering smoke, but was later unable to reach her again. heavy smoke charred glass facade of the building as firefighters struggled to extinguish the blaze, climbing up and down a ladder in a desperate search for survivors. organizers called off a leg of the 2018 pyeongchang winter games torch relay in jecheon on what should have been a day of celebration ahead of the games.  we thought that having a torch relay at a place where so many people died in a fire accident is just not right, and therefore canceled today s event in jecheon,  ryu hoyon, the torch relay manager for the pyeongchang organizing committee, told reuters.  we are planning to adjust further schedules with those who want to continue the relay.  jecheon is southeast of the capital seoul and is popular with visitors to its mountains and lakes.

" u.s. missile strikes on a syrian air base are unlikely to halt u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson’s planned visit to moscow next week, the head of the russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee said on friday. “i don’t think this will impact tillerson’s visit, we need to restore dialogue. we should welcome tillerson, exchange views and try and talk sense into washington,” leonid slutsky told the russia 24 television channel, interfax reported. “that’s much better than hiding behind walls.” tillerson is due to visit russia for talks next week. the united states on friday fired dozens of cruise missiles at a syrian air base from which it said a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week. russian president vladimir putin has called the action “aggression against a sovereign nation” on a “made up pretext”.

" china said on monday it hopes the iran nuclear deal will stay intact, playing an important role in keeping the peace, after a senior u.s. official said president donald trump is expected to decertify the agreement. the official, speaking last week on condition of anonymity, said trump was also expected to roll out a broader u.s. strategy on iran that would be more confrontational. the trump administration has frequently criticized iran’s conduct in the middle east. trump, who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated”, has been weighing whether it serves u.s. security interests as he faces an oct. 15 deadline for certifying that iran is complying with its terms. speaking in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the iran nuclear deal was a good example of how to solve something peacefully through talks.  the agreement had played a positive and important role in ensuring nuclear non proliferation and protecting peace and stability in the middle east, she added.  “we hope that the comprehensive iran nuclear agreement can continue to be earnestly implemented,” hua told a daily news briefing. iranian authorities have repeatedly said tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions that had crippled its economy. if trump declines to certify iran’s compliance, u.s. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran suspended under the agreement. the prospect that washington could renege on the pact, which was signed by the united states, britain, france, germany, russia, china, the european union and iran, has worried some u.s. allies. china has close economic and diplomatic ties with tehran, and was also instrumental in pushing through the landmark 2015 deal.

" u.s. president donald trump and south korean president moon jae in will hold talks on north korea s nuclear crisis on thursday amid tensions over whether trump s harsh rhetoric against north korean leader kim jong un could lead to a miscalculation. u.s. officials scrambled to stress diplomatic options remained open after trump used his u.n. general assembly speech on tuesday to threaten to  totally destroy  nuclear armed north korea and blast kim as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. trump and moon are to sit down at midday on the last day of trump s four day visit to new york, where he met with a flurry of foreign leaders gathered for the annual u.n. event. trump will first meet moon, then have lunch with moon and japanese prime minister shinzo abe, then meet separately with abe. publicly, the south korean government described trump s speech as an expression of how serious the united states views the north korean nuclear challenge.  we view the speech as portraying a firm and specific stance on the key issues regarding keeping peace and safety that the international community and the united nations are faced with,  moon s office said in a statement on wednesday. but two senior south korean diplomats, interviewed by reuters, expressed concern that trump s rhetoric could provoke a miscalculation from kim and prompt him to launch an attack. the diplomats also said the two governments are not communicating the same message, with south korea saying it cannot afford another war on the korean peninsula.  any allies can t be on the exact same page on every matter but it s concerning that we are giving the impression that the two countries have different voices,  one diplomat said. a senior u.s. official dismissed the south korean diplomats  worries about a miscalculation and said a cautious approach by past u.s. administrations had not stopped north korea from developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.  they re always worried about that,  the official said.  the cautious, go slow approach of strategic patience has gotten us to where we are.  u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters on wednesday night that u.s. led sanctions against north korea are starting to take effect with the north experiencing fuel shortages. trump and moon are also at odds over trade. trump has complained about the u.s. trade deficit with south korea, but has so far been persuaded by his top advisers not to terminate a  u.s. south korean trade agreement as he has threatened. moon, speaking at a business event in new york, urged greater u.s. investment in south korea and defended the u.s. south korea trade agreement known as korus.  it is a fact that the korea u.s. fta is an agreement that benefits both countries by expanding their trade, enhancing market accessibility and increasing their investment and jobs,  yonhap quoted moon as saying. it said he added that the u.s  trade deficit with south korea was limited to products and was shrinking while south korea continued to post large trade deficits with the united states in the service sector.

" four u.s. senators   two democrats and two republicans   introduced a bill on tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market. senators charles grassley, chair of the judiciary committee, and patrick leahy, the top democrat, are sponsors of the bill along with senators mike lee and amy klobuchar, the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top democrat, respectively. the food and drug administration, which ensures the safety of the country’s food and drug supply, has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, called rems, which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely. but there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions. generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol, making it difficult to come to market. the bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol. “balancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task. it’s a consistent topic at my town meetings,” grassley said in a statement. “unfortunately, we’re seeing some brand name drug companies engage in anti competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market. this bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated.” there is a similar bill in the house of representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy. for example, it requires the generic company seeking a rems drug to get fda authorization to obtain the sample. in one of the rems disputes which is public, mylan pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in 2014 against celgene corp, accusing it of using rems to prevent generic copies of thalomid and revlimid to market. the senate judiciary committee’s antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on june 21. the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america, or phrma, which counts major drugmakers among its members, said it had no immediate comment. the generic pharmaceutical association was pleased to see the bill introduced. “it is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings,” said chip davis, gpha’s president. “continued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome.” ",0
" japan formally decided on tuesday it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with u.s. made ground based aegis radar stations and interceptors in response to a growing threat from north korean rockets. a proposal to build two aegis ashore batteries was approved by prime minister shinzo abe s cabinet. the sites without the missiles will likely cost at least $2 billion and are not likely to be operational until 2023 at the earliest, sources familiar with the plan told reuters earlier.  north korea s nuclear missile development poses a new level of threat to japan and as we have done in the past we will ensure that we are able to defend ourselves with a drastic improvement in ballistic missile defense,  japanese minister of defence itsunori onodera told reporters after the cabinet meeting.  the decision to acquire the ground version of the aegis missile defense system, which is already deployed on japanese warships, was widely expected. north korea on nov. 29 tested a new, more powerful ballistic missile that it says can hit major u.s. cities including washington, and fly over japan s current defense shield. that rocket reached an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles), well above the range of interceptor missiles on japanese ships operating in the sea of japan. north korea says its weapons programs are necessary to counter u.s. aggression.  the new aegis stations may not, however, come with a powerful radar, dubbed spy 6, which is being developed by the united states.  without it, japan will not be able to fully utilize the extended range of a new interceptor missile, the sm 3 block iia, which cost about $30 million each.    a later upgrade, once the u.s. military has deployed spy 6 on its ships around 2022, could prove a costly proposition for japan as outlays on new equipment squeeze its military budget. initial funding will be ring fenced in the next defense budget beginning in april, but no decision has been made on the radar, or the overall cost, or schedule, of the deployment, a ministry of defence official said at a press briefing. japan s military planners also evaluated the u.s. built thaad (terminal high altitude area defense) system before deciding on aegis ashore.  separately, minister of defence itsunori onodera said this month japan would acquire medium range cruise missiles it can launch from its f 15 and f 35 fighters at sites in north korea, in a bid to deter any attack.  the purchase of what will become the longest range munitions in japan s military arsenal is controversial because it renounced the right to wage war against other nations in its post world war two constitution.

" french cement group lafarge paid close to 13 million euros ($15.2 million) to armed groups including islamic state militants to keep operating in syria from 2011 2015, human rights lawyers said on tuesday. they were speaking at a news conference on the course of french prosecutors  preliminary inquiry into lafarge s operations launched in june on suspicion of  financing of a terrorist enterprise . the lawyers for rights group sherpa said a large part of the money went directly or indirectly into the pockets of islamic state and that payments lasted until well after the closure of lafarge s jalabiya plant in september 2014. they were citing a figure pinpointed by prosecutors examining lafarge s activities in syria, in the throes of civil war since 2011, and drawn from an internal report by u.s. law firm baker and mckenzie for lafarge.  as part of the inquiry, the precise figure retained is 12,946,000 euros paid by lafarge between 2011 and 2015 to terrorist organizations, including the islamic state,  sherpa lawyer marie dose said. lafarge became lafargeholcim, the world s largest cement maker, in 2015 after a takeover by swiss holcim.  former lafargeholcim ceo eric olsen resigned in april after the company admitted it had paid armed groups to keep a factory operating in syria. his lawyer has said olsen will appeal against being put under investigation. sherpa and other human rights groups in france as well as the french finance ministry have filed suit against lafarge. sherpa wants the company to be placed under formal criminal investigation, like olsen, and also accuses lafarge of not cooperating with authorities and trying to hide important elements from the investigation. a lafargeholcim spokeswoman on tuesday rejected these accusations but would not comment on the 13 million euro figure.  lafargeholcim fully cooperates with the justice (authorities). thousands of documents have been given by the group to magistrates or seized during a search,  she said.  we strongly contest that the company is trying in any way  to limit the right of its employees or former employees to defend themselves...or (limit) their capacity to cooperate in a judicial inquiry,  she added. being placed under formal investigation in france means that prosecutors believe they have  serious or consistent evidence  that could result in prosecution. it is a step toward a possible trial, though the investigation can still be dropped. last friday the paris prosecutor also placed olsen s predecessor as ceo, bruno lafont, and his ex deputy for operations under formal investigation as part of the inquiry into lafarge activities in syria, the two men s lawyers said.

" one of humanity s most isolated outposts joined the 21st century on saturday when the british island of st. helena, home to  the world s most useless airport , welcomed its first commercial flight. as the inaugural plane from johannesburg touched down on the forbidding volcanic outcrop in the middle of the south atlantic, the travel and history buffs on board clapped and cheered.  i ve never felt so emotional in all my life,  said libby weir breen, a british travel operator who has been bringing tourists to the island, 1,200 miles (1,900 km) west of the african nation of angola, for the last 12 years. she had flown in specially from scotland to be on the plane, and dabbed away tears as it touched down on the spectacular cliff side runway.  i never thought i d see this day,  she said.  the 4,500 people living on st. helena, a british colony since 1658   most famous as the windswept outpost where french emperor napoleon bonaparte breathed his last   might also be forgiven for thinking the day would never come. there has been talk of building an airport on st. helena since the 1930s. the best site   one of the few flat spaces on the notoriously craggy island   was ruled out because of a nearby breeding ground for the wirebird, an endangered species of plover. an airport at the new site, on top of a valley filled in with 8 million cubic meters of rock, suffered numerous setbacks and delays as costs ballooned to 285 million pounds, to the horror of the british government. the runway and terminal were completed in 2016 but the official opening was pushed back another year after test flights were buffeted by wicked cross winds, making it unsafe for large aircraft to use. with britain mired in financial austerity, the london media were quick to condemn it as a white elephant, or  the world s most useless airport , with a price tag of more than 60,000 pounds for every saint, as the island s residents are known. before the opening of the airport, which will receive weekly flights to and from the south african commercial capital, the only way to st. helena was a five night voyage from cape town aboard the rms st. helena, a british postal ship. with the risk of wind shear limiting the size of planes and numbers of passengers   saturday s flight had room for 100 but only 68 on board due to weight restrictions   the hoped for tourist boom is unlikely to materialize. hotel capacity has jumped in the last few years from just a few dozen rooms to more than 100, but, with a maximum of 3,500 visitors a year, the island is unlikely to be weaned off the 53 million pounds it receives in aid every year from london. besides napoleon s old house, longwood, and a cemetery holding some of the 6,000 afrikaner prisoners sent there by the british during the anglo boer wars in south africa, st. helena offers scuba diving and walking in pristine natural wildernesses. governor lisa phillips dismissed the critics and said that even before it accepted its first commercial flight, the airport had proved its worth in the last 18 months by enabling several life saving emergency medical evacuations, including a newborn child.  i ve seen the headlines about the world s most useless airport, but for st. helenans this has already been the most useful airport,  she told reporters after greeting them on the tarmac.  it s priceless.

" the national rifle association is on track for record spending this year on u.s. political campaigns, including missouri’s u.s. senate race where a gun owning democrat is waging a tough fight against an incumbent republican backed by the gun rights group. democrat jason kander, an afghanistan war veteran, is running just 2.5 percentage points behind republican u.s. senator roy blunt in opinion polls in missouri, despite the nra’s expenditure of $1.8 million so far trying to protect blunt as well as the republicans’ u.s. senate majority. gun violence has transfixed the united states in 2016, from a massacre at an orlando, florida, nightclub to a rash of police shootings, fueling demands by some democrats and activists for tighter gun laws. those efforts have been thwarted, as in years past, by the nra and its supporters, who say such measures would infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the second amendment of the u.s. constitution. congress has not approved major gun control legislation since the 1990s. an aug. 19 reuters/ipsos poll found 41.8 percent of respondents agreed there should be strong restrictions on firearms and 22.4 percent supported moderate regulations.     per capita firearm ownership in the united states far exceeds any other country, according to government estimates.   in the missouri race and other senate contests in states such as north carolina, nevada, florida and new hampshire, the gun control battle gripping washington is playing out on the campaign trail. the nra has spent $23.4 million in this election cycle, with a month to go before voting on nov. 8, compared with a previous high of $27 million in the entire 2014 campaign cycle, according to federal data gathered by the center for responsive politics. the nra did not respond to requests for comment. in addition to senate republicans, the lobbying group is also backing republican presidential nominee donald trump. blunt, 66, is a two decade veteran of congress. he accuses kander, 35, of being soft on gun ownership rights. blunt has an “a” rating from the nra. kander has an “f,” which the nra says he earned by backing expanded background checks on gun buyers and legislation that failed this year in congress to bar people on “terrorism watch lists” from buying guns. “the difference between senator blunt and myself is that i want to stop criminals and suspected terrorists from having the same access to guns as the rest of us, which is why i support background checks,” kander said in a statement to reuters on thursday. kander, missouri’s secretary of state, counterpunched against blunt last month with a 30 second tv commercial that has had more than 1 million views on youtube.com.  in the ad, the former u.s. army captain assembles a military style rifle while blindfolded. he says he has supported gun ownership rights, but adds: “i also believe in background checks so that terrorists can’t get their hands on one of these.” a fierce debate in washington over such background checks in june led to a 25 hour sit in by democrats on the floor of the house of representatives.  “the reaction to that ad has reset the debate” in the missouri senate race, said tim daly, managing director of guns and crime policy for the liberal center for american progress, a think tank in washington. kander’s polling numbers were already rising when the sept. 15 ad was first broadcast. but daly said kander planted fresh doubts over the nra position on background checks. blunt and his campaign spokesmen were not available for comment.  the nra is blunt’s no. 2 financial backer in the missouri race, surpassed only by a group closely associated with u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that backs republicans. like the blunt kander battle, other key 2016 senate races feature intense debate over guns as republicans work to defend their control of the senate. in north carolina, the nra has pumped in $2.8 million to support threatened incumbent republican senator richard burr. the first televised debate in new hampshire this week between republican senator kelly ayotte and her democratic challenger, governor maggie hassan, began with a moderator asking how they could reduce gun violence without infringing on gun rights. ayotte has come under attack from americans for responsible solutions for her opposition to tough gun background checks. the group works to reduce u.s. gun violence in the united states.

" an ecuadorean court on wednesday sentenced vice president jorge glas to six years in jail after finding him guilty of receiving bribes from brazilian construction company odebrecht [odbct.ul]  in return for handing the scandal ridden firm state contracts. a close ally of leftist ex president rafael correa, glas served as correa s vice president from 2013 and retained the position under current president lenin moreno. but moreno, who has largely broken from correa, suspended glas in august, accusing him of not being a team player. an ecuadorean judge in october then ordered pre trial detention for glas as part of the investigation into odebrecht. the public prosecutor s office accused him of pocketing a roughly $13.5 million bribe from odebrecht via his uncle.  glas constructed, with (former odebrecht executive) jose conceicao santos, the awarding of public contracts in return for payment,  judge edgar flores said on wednesday as he read the decision. glas, a 48 year old electrical engineer, has been accused by senior members of correa s government of corruption while serving as strategic sectors minister and vice president. his lawyer slammed the decision as  unjust  and vowed to appeal. glas  downfall highlights how fallout from the massive odebrecht corruption scandal has continued to ripple across south america. the company, which has admitted to paying bribes to win contracts in a number of countries, has paid $3.5 billion in settlements in the united states, brazil and switzerland. odebrecht allegedly paid $33.5 million in bribes to secure contracts in ecuador. the opposition says that correa s government was slow to investigate, although he rejects that.

" u.s. senator bernie sanders turned up the pressure on president elect donald trump on saturday about his pledge to try to stop an indiana air conditioner manufacturer from moving 1,400 jobs to mexico. both sanders, who challenged hillary clinton for the democratic nomination, and trump seized on an announcement earlier this year by united technologies corp’s carrier division that it would shift production to mexico as an example of how trade deals hurt u.s. workers. sanders on saturday warned “it is not good enough to save some of these jobs” and said trump should use as leverage united technologies’ defense contracts, export import bank financing, and tax breaks. “i call on mr. trump to make it clear to the ceo of united technologies that if his firm wants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to mexico,” the senator from vermont said in a statement. a representative for carrier declined to comment on sanders’ statement. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, said on thursday that he was “working hard, even on thanksgiving” to get the plant to stay and said he was “making progress” on the issue. carrier corp. confirmed it had “discussions with the incoming administration.” neither side has provided details. trump had threatened to slap taxes on the company’s air conditioners made in mexico and shipped back to the united states. a spokesman was not immediately available for comment on sanders’ statement on saturday. sanders said he would soon introduce legislation that would prevent companies that outsource from receiving federal contracts, grants and loans, and force companies that outsource jobs to pay a penalty tax and pay back tax breaks.

" most of an islamic state evacuation convoy stuck in east syria has crossed out of government territory and is no longer the responsibility of the syrian government or its ally hezbollah, the lebanese shi ite group said on saturday.  a u.s. led coalition fighting islamic state has been using warplanes to prevent the convoy from entering territory held by the jihadists in east syria. hezbollah and the syrian army had escorted it from west syria as part of a truce deal.   the syrian state and hezbollah have fulfilled their obligations to transfer buses out of the area of syrian government control without exposing them,  the statement said.  hezbollah said in a statement that the u.s. led jets were still blocking the convoy of fighters and their families, which was stuck in the desert, and were also stopping any aid from reaching it.  six buses remain in government held territory under the protection and care of the syrian state and hezbollah, the statement said. there were originally 17 buses in the convoy.  hezbollah said there were old people, casualties and pregnant women in the buses stranded outside syrian government control in the desert and called on the international community to step in to prevent them coming to harm.  about 300 lightly armed fighters were traveling on the buses, having surrendered their enclave straddling syria s border with lebanon on monday under a deal which allowed them to join their jihadist comrades on the other side of the country.  it angered both the u.s. led coalition, which does not want more battle hardened militants in an area where it is operating, and iraq, which sees them as a threat because the convoy s proposed destination of al bukamal is close to its own border. the syrian government of president bashar al assad, helped by russia and iran backed militias including hezbollah, is fighting islamic state as it pushes eastwards across the desert. a commander in the pro assad military alliance said earlier on saturday that hezbollah and the syrian army were seeking an alternative way for the convoy to cross into islamic state territory, having already tried two other routes.   work is under way to change the course of the convoy for a second time,  the commander said.  the coalition has vowed to continue monitoring the convoy and disrupting any effort it makes to cross into jihadist territory but said it would not bomb it directly because it contains about 300 civilian family members of the fighters. it has asked russia to tell the syrian government that it will not allow the convoy to move further east towards the iraqi border, according to a statement issued late on friday.  on wednesday, the coalition said its jets had cratered a road and destroyed a bridge to stop the convoy progressing, and had bombed some of the jihadists  comrades coming the other way to meet it.  hezbollah and the syrian army on thursday changed the route of the convoy from humeima, a hamlet deep in the southeast desert, to a location further north, but coalition jets again struck near that route, the commander said.   it was considered a threat, meaning there was no passage that way,  the commander said. on friday coalition jets made mock air raids over the convoy, the commander added.   it caused panic among the daeshis. the militants are scared the convoy will be bombarded as soon as it enters deir al zor,  the commander said, using a plural form of the arabic acronym for islamic state to refer to its fighters.

" president elect donald trump plans to nominate a third retired general for a top job in his new administration with the choice of a battle hardened marine commander to lead the agency set up after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks to protect the u.s. homeland.  trump is expected to name former marine general john kelly, 66, as head of the department of homeland security, a source familiar with the decision told reuters on wednesday. kelly told fox news on wednesday that he has “been asked and would consider it an honor.” if confirmed by the senate, kelly will be in charge of the agency tasked with securing borders against illegal immigration, protecting the president, responding to natural disasters, coordinating intelligence and counterterrorism.  like trump, kelly is believed to hold strong views on stopping illegal immigration. the four star general told a congressional committee last year that the lack of security on the u.s. mexican border represents a national security threat.      as former head of the military’s southern command, kelly was responsible for u.s. military activities and relationships in latin america and the caribbean. he was a proponent of keeping open the u.s. military prison in guantanamo bay, cuba. kelly, whose son was killed fighting the taliban in afghanistan, retired in january after a 45 year military career. cbs first reported that trump would nominate kelly to the position, which would put him in charge of more than 240,000 employees. those include secret service and border patrol agents as well as the agency that clears refugees for resettlement in the united states. under democratic president barack obama, the department’s border patrol and immigration enforcement agents were criticized by civil rights groups for acting as a paramilitary force that neglected the humanitarian mission of helping immigrants escaping violence. with a retired general as chief, the department risks furthering that image and facing backlash from democrats and immigrant rights groups.  trump energized voters in the election campaign by promising to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border in order to keep out mexican immigrants he described as rapists and murderers.     in testimony last year before the senate armed services committee, kelly said people smuggling activities on the southern border were a dire threat.      “terrorist organizations could seek to leverage those same smuggling routes to move operatives with intent to cause grave harm to our citizens or even bring weapons of mass destruction into the united states,” kelly said.  such sentiments may have endeared him to trump, who warned repeatedly during his presidential campaign of dangers from illegal immigration, and pledged to make mexico pay for the wall along the border. the republican president elect, who has no military experience, also plans to nominate retired general james mattis to lead the pentagon and picked retired lieutenant general michael flynn to be his national security adviser. trump may be forced to look to generals to fill key positions because he lacks a relationship with republican establishment figures, said former white house and state department official p.j. crowley.  “he never served in government, so until the campaign, he didn’t have an established bench,” said crowley. “he’s forming a pickup team on the fly. on an individual basis, they have a lot of international operational experience but far less domestic political experience. how well they will gel together remains to be seen,” said crowley, author of “red line,” a book on u.s. foreign policy. trump’s transition team is also said to be considering former army general david petraeus for secretary of state.  kelly served in iraq several times, and in 2003 was the first marine in more than 50 years to be promoted to the rank of brigadier general while in a combat zone. in 2010, his son, marine 1st lieutenant robert m. kelly, was killed in helmand province in southern afghanistan. human rights groups had feared someone would be appointed to homeland security with a stronger anti immigration position, such as kansas secretary of state kris kobach, who is a proponent of reinvigorating a system to track muslims entering the united states on visas. frank sharry, executive director of america’s voice education fund, an immigrant rights advocacy group, said he was hopeful kelly’s experience in central america would make him sympathetic to migrants fleeing violence in the region.  but sharry said he was concerned over the number of generals trump has appointed. “at times trump’s cabinet looks like a military junta. there’s been a securitization of migration that is out of whack with reality,” said sharry. “but i’ll take a general with knowledge of the americas over a radical like kobach.” the national border patrol council, an early trump backer that represents some 18,000 border patrol agents and other employees, noted that kelly had no immigration experience but had “stellar credentials.” it said in a statement that his popularity with troops boded well for morale problems at the department of homeland security, but added that “we believe no other cabinet level nominee will be under more pressure to produce.”   kelly questioned the pentagon’s decision to allow women to serve in combat, and differed publicly with obama over the president’s attempt to close the guantanamo bay prison. “there are no innocent men down there,” kelly said of guantanamo in a january interview with the military times newspaper. the republican controlled senate must confirm kelly for the homeland security post.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions equated the opioid epidemic to a personal failing by many americans who cannot “say no” to drugs on thursday, and he said that marijuana could be serving as a gateway to the problem. “people should say no to drug use. they have got to protect themselves first,” he said during a question and answer session at the heritage foundation think tank in washington. sessions made his comments ahead of president donald trump’s declaration that the opioid crisis a public health emergency, a move that will redirect federal resources to help combat the problem. sessions said he was extremely troubled by the epidemic, saying it has led to more overdose deaths than the height of the aids public health crisis in the 1980s. according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 u.s. deaths in 2015. the justice department has stepped up enforcement efforts to combat the problem.  earlier on thursday, the justice department announced it had secured an indictment against a pittsburgh based doctor for unlawfully distributing opioids, in the first case of its kind to be brought since sessions launched an opioid abuse and detection unit.    but in response to a question about how best to combat the epidemic, sessions cast the problem in a moral light. “i do think that this whole country needs to not be so lackadaisical about drugs,” he said. in urging people to say no to drugs, his comments channeled former first lady nancy reagan, who famously launched a “just say no” anti drug campaign when the crack cocaine epidemic was ravaging communities in the 1980s.  her husband, president ronald reagan, during his tenure signed into law a sweeping criminal justice bill that established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, including marijuana. sessions said on thursday that “fentanyl people are really killers,” but did not clarify to whom he was specifically referring. he also said that he has heard from many police chiefs that drug addiction “starts with marijuana.” fentanyl is a synthetic opiate that is up to 50 times more lethal than heroin. michael correia, the government relations director for the national cannabis industry association, said sessions is ill informed and pointed to data showing many of the overdoses involve prescription painkillers. according to the cdc, nearly half of all the opioid overdose deaths in the united states in 2015 involved prescription medications. correia said sessions “is still repeating the old, tired  argument that marijuana is a gateway when there is a lot of evidence that proves otherwise.” ",0

" lawyers for the united states on monday urged jurors to allow the u.s. government to seize a manhattan office tower from a non profit for violating u.s. sanctions against iran. in closing arguments at the end of a month long trial in manhattan federal court, assistant u.s. attorney michael lockard told jurors that the non profit alavi foundation, the building’s majority owner, knew its minority partner, assa corp, was a front for iran’s government and helped hide that fact. “they knew that when that secret got out, they stood to lose everything,” he said. the government wants to seize the 36 story building at 650 fifth avenue, likely worth close to $1 billion, to benefit people with judgments against iran relating to bombings and other attacks. john gleeson, arguing for alavi, did not dispute that alavi knew assa was owned by iran’s state controlled bank melli when it entered into a partnership with it in 1989. but he said the foundation, established in the 1970s by the shah of iran to promote persian and islamic culture in the united states, was led to believe that assa was sold before 1995, and was misled when it tried to learn more. “at every turn, it was either ignored, or given the run around, or lied to,” gleeson said. lockard told jurors that alavi continued to turn rental income from the building over to assa after the united states imposed sanctions on iran in 1995, violating those sanctions. he pointed to evidence including testimony from former alavi board member seyed mojtaba hesami kiche, a key government witness. he said a letter from another former board member to iran’s supreme leader ali khamenei referred to the united states as “the great satan” and suggested alavi was working for iran. lockard acknowledged that much of the evidence was from before 1995, but said alavi personnel did not “forget” who controlled assa when the sanctions took effect. gleeson described alavi as a legitimate non profit raising money for charitable activities. he attacked the credibility of hesami kiche, who was paid by the u.s. government and admitted on the stand that he initially failed to pay taxes on that money. gleeson is expected to continue his arguments on tuesday. the government will be allowed a brief response.

" china will bring its paramilitary police force, the people s armed police, under the control of the central military commission which controls the country s armed forces from jan. 1, state media said on wednesday. since taking power five years ago, president xi jinping has overseen a sweeping modernization of the people s liberation army, the world s largest military, laying off troops, streamlining its organization and investing in advanced weapons. in a brief report, the official xinhua news agency said that from midnight on jan. 1 the people s armed police would no longer fall under the purview of the state council, or cabinet, and instead report to the central military commission. xi heads the central military commission in his role as armed forces chief and commander in chief. xi has steadily consolidated his power over the military, and has appointed allies to key positions of power in the armed forces. xinhua did not provide any details on how the new reporting structure would work or why the government had made the decision. however, the party s official people s daily, in a commentary for publication on thursday but reported by xinhua on wednesday, said the move was needed to ensure security and promote the aim of having a  strong military . the people s armed police will remain separate, carry out its existing functions and not be absorbed into the people s liberation army, the people s daily said. the paramilitary police force serves as a backup for the military in times of war, and domestically has a role in putting down protests and counter terrorism as well as border defense and fire fighting. xi has radically overhauled the old soviet era command structure of the military to make the armed forces nimbler and better able to respond to crises at home and abroad. that has included condensing the command structure and giving greater emphasis on new capabilities including cyberspace, electronic and information warfare. china s military has not fought a war in decades, but faces what the government calls a complex security environment, such as nuclear armed north korea and territorial disputes in the south china sea and over self ruled taiwan, claimed by china as its own.

" the top executive at the company behind the embattled dakota access pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to republican presidential candidate donald trump since june, according to campaign finance disclosure records. the donations by kelcy warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator energy transfer partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the u.s. oil and gas industry than his opponent, democrat hillary clinton. warren donated $300 to the trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election.  he also gave $100,000 to the trump victory fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the trump campaign, the republican national committee, the republican party of arkansas and the connecticut republican party.  the donations, first reported by the british newspaper the guardian, were made before the u.s. government halted construction on a segment of energy transfer partners’ 1,100 mile (1,770 km) dakota access pipeline in early september following protests by native american and environmental groups.  the project, which would move oil from the highly productive bakken shale formation to the midwest and gulf coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and native american tribe members and other protesters. opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the standing rock sioux tribe and pollute the area’s drinking water.  warren has also given $66,800 to the republication national committee since trump secured the nomination for the nov. 8 election, the guardian reported. trump has not yet taken a position on the dakota access pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. asked about trump’s position on the dakota access pipeline in a policy debate this week, u.s. representative kevin cramer of north dakota, one of the candidate’s main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of trump. he added, “i’m not sure he (trump) is aware of it.”  if elected, trump in his first 100 days will ask transcanada to renew its permit application for the keystone xl pipeline, according to his campaign website. u.s. president barack obama rejected the proposed pipeline from canada last november. trump has holdings in energy transfer partners and phillips 66, a joint owner of the dakota access pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records. u.s. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the democratic candidate and $99,302 to trump since july, according to a reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

" south korea will resume the suspended construction of two new nuclear reactors from midnight, its energy ministry said on tuesday, but has torn up plans to build six more reactors as seoul seeks to meet pledges to cut reliance on nuclear power. the move will restart work on the two reactors that was frozen after president moon jae in came to power in may on a ticket calling for scaling back nuclear power. it comes after results of a survey unveiled last week found a majority of south koreans actually backed the projects. the world s fifth biggest nuclear energy user currently runs 24 nuclear reactors, generating a third of the country s total electricity needs.  construction work (for the two new nuclear reactors) will begin immediately after midnight,  paik un gyu, minister of trade, industry and energy, told a news briefing in the capital.  but in a bid to press on with moon s commitment to boost use of natural gas and renewable sources in the nation s energy mix, the ministry said seoul will also cancel all plans to construct a further six nuclear reactors. the number of nuclear reactors operating in south korea will be cut to a net 14 by 2038 it said. the ministry said it will use alternative fuels such as solar and wind power to replace the six nuclear reactors with a projected combined capacity of 8.8 gigawatts (gw).     additionally, the asia s fourth largest economy will not allow extending the lifespan of 14 aging nuclear power stations, totaling 12.5 gw of capacity, the statement said. the energy ministry said it will reflect changes in the country s long term energy mix plan, which is expected to be finalised in november.

" a new york city official on tuesday ordered an audit of the city’s election authorities, citing “deep concern over widespread reports of poll site problems and irregularities” as voters cast their ballots in the state’s primary election. new york republicans and democrats are holding presidential nominating contests for the nov. 8 election. delegate rich new york, the fourth most populous u.s. state, is a big prize for the candidates. “there is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get into their polling site,” city comptroller scott stringer said. stringer said his office had received reports of polling stations that failed to open on time and were unable to tell voters when they would be operational. a voter in the borough of queens reported a broken machine and staff instructing voters to place their ballots in a “slot” for processing at a later time. in a letter to the new york city board of elections, the comptroller cited reports that polling staff were unable to operate voting machines, were giving out conflicting information and erroneously directing voters to alternate sites. of particular concern, stringer said, were allegations of widespread removal of eligible voters from registration rolls and incorrect party affiliations on voter records. stringer said eligible democratic voters in brooklyn fell by 120,000 from november 2015 to april 2016 without explanation.   board of elections officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

" syria s main opposition group selected a new chief negotiator on friday ahead of a new round of u.n. backed peace negotiations with the damascus government set to kick off next week. nasr hariri said the opposition was going to geneva on nov. 28 to hold direct talks and was ready to discuss  everything on the negotiating table . the announcement came at a summit in riyadh where, a day before, the opposition stuck by its demand that president bashar al assad play no role in an interim period, despite speculation that it could soften its stance because of assad s battlefield strength. the opposition groups met to seek a unified position ahead of geneva after two years of russian military intervention that has helped assad s government reverse major territorial losses incurred since the beginning of the war. hariri replaces hardliner riyad hijab, who led the higher negotiations committee at previous negotiations but abruptly quit this week, hinting that the hnc under him had faced pressures to make concessions that favored assad. u.n. peace talks mediator staffan de mistura, preparing for the next round of geneva talks, met on friday with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov, who said moscow was working with riyadh to unify the syrian opposition. for many years, western and arab countries backed the opposition demand that assad leave office. but since russia joined the war on behalf of assad s government it has become increasingly clear that assad s opponents have no path to victory on the battlefield. russian president vladimir putin has called for a congress of the syrian government and opposition to draw up a framework for the future structure of the syrian state, adopt a new constitution and hold elections under u.n. supervision.  but he has also said that any political settlement in syria would be finalised within the geneva peace talks process overseen by the united nations. the opposition has long been suspicious of the parallel diplomatic track pushed by russia, which before the proposed sochi congress included talks in kazakhstan, and has insisted that political dialogue should only take place in geneva. hariri said sochi did not serve the political process and called on the international community, including russia,  to concentrate all our efforts to serve the political process according to international resolutions in geneva under un auspices . alaa arafat, who represents the  moscow platform  political grouping, though, said he would attend sochi and urged others to go too, reflecting lingering tensions within the diverse opposition. saudi foreign minister adel jubeir, who opened the summit on wednesday pledging his country s support for unifying the opposition, praised the creation of  one negotiating team that represents everyone . asked if there was any change in position towards assad s future, he told reporters that riyadh continued to support a settlement based on the u.n. backed process at geneva.  we support the positions of the syrian opposition. we have from the beginning and we will continue to do so,  he said. syria s six year old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since world war two.

" indian prime minister narendra modi will discuss rising violence in myanmar s western rakhine state during a visit that begins on tuesday, and push for greater progress on long running indian infrastructure projects, officials said.  india seeks to boost economic ties with resource rich myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600 km (1,000 mile) border, to counter chinese influence and step up connectivity with a country it considers its gateway to southeast asia. two way trade has grown to around $2.2 billion as india courted myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but indian funded projects have moved slowly. modi s promises to  act east  and cement ties with india s eastern neighbor have slipped even as china has strengthened its influence. his first bilateral visit comes amid a spike in violence in rakhine, after a military counter offensive against insurgents killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of nearly 90,000 villagers to bangladesh since aug. 25. the violence could hit development of a transport corridor that begins in rakhine, with the indian built port of sittwe and includes road links to india s remote northeast, analysts said.  it s going to be a very vexed and complex issue,  said tridivesh singh maini, a new delhi based expert on ties with myanmar.  you need to play it very smartly. you need to make it clear that rakhine violence has regional implications... but india will not get into saying,  this is how you should resolve it.  last month, india said it wanted to deport 40,000 rohingya refugees who left myanmar in previous years. modi arrives from china late on tuesday in the capital naypyidaw to meet president htin kyaw on a three day visit. new delhi believes the best way to reduce tension in rakhine is through development efforts, such as the kaladan transport project there, said indian foreign ministry official sripriya ranganathan.      we are very confident that once that complete corridor is functional, there will be a positive impact on the situation in the state,  she told reporters. modi will meet myanmar leader aung san suu kyi and visit the heritage city of bagan and a hindu temple. the countries share close cultural ties, and several in myanmar trace their roots to india.  modi will also talk up a trilateral highway project connecting india s northeast with myanmar and thailand.  there is a fear that china is already going full steam ahead,  said udai bhanu singh of delhi think tank, the institute for defence studies and analyses.  from the indian side, there has been some laxity.   singh said india could offer myanmar help in building its navy and coastguard, while myanmar would seek assurances that india was a reliable economic partner and an alternative power to beijing.

" the white house said on wednesday it will redirect $589 million in funds to prepare for the zika virus before the mosquito that carries it begins to emerge in the continental united states, but urged congress to act quickly on its request for more money. white house budget director shaun donovan said the use of money previously provided for fighting another health crisis, the ebola virus, was only a temporary fix for zika funding. donovan said some measures to fight zika would have to be delayed, curtailed or stopped unless the u.s. congress approves more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds requested by the obama administration in february. the zika virus, linked to a growing number of cases of the birth defect microcephaly in brazil, is spreading rapidly in latin america and the caribbean and heading north as the weather gets warmer. “we should not play with fire here,” donovan told reporters on a conference call. without full zika funding, u.s. health and human services secretary sylvia mathews burwell said mosquito control and surveillance may have to be delayed or stopped, vaccine development could be jeopardized and development of faster diagnostic tests could be impaired. most of the $589 million will come from $2.7 billion in funds set aside for public health projects aimed at the ebola virus. west africa was stricken by a two year ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people starting in december 2013 and led to a small number of cases in the united states. the republican controlled congress has said the white house should draw the money needed to fight zika from the ebola funds. chairman hal rogers and other top republicans on the house of representatives appropriations committee said in a statement they would “monitor the changing needs resulting from this unpredictable crisis” to ensure that needed funds are available. “republicans are going to look back on this time that they’ve had to act on the zika virus and deeply regret it,” white house spokesman josh earnest said. burwell said a recent flare up of ebola in west africa shows the united states cannot shortchange its work in the region. “we face two global health challenges, ebola and zika, and we don’t have an option to set one aside in the name of the other,” burwell told reporters. burwell said there were 672 confirmed cases of zika infections in the united states, including 64 pregnant women. she said there was one confirmed case of zika related microcephaly in hawaii. the world health organization has said there is a strong scientific consensus that zika can cause microcephaly as well as guillain barre syndrome, though proof may take months or years. microcephaly is a condition defined by unusually small heads in babies that can result in developmental problems. guillain barre syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. brazil said it has confirmed more than 940 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to zika infections in the mothers. brazil is investigating nearly 4,300 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.

" gary cohn, president donald trump’s top economic adviser, drafted a letter of resignation over the administration’s weak response to recent clashes between neo nazis and anti racism protesters, but decided to stay on the job, the new york times reported on friday. cohn spoke publicly about the controversy for the first time in an interview with the financial times newspaper, saying the administration needed to clearly reject hate groups. he said  there was no equivalence between white supremacists or neo nazis and those who protest inequality. “i believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,” the former goldman sachs president told the newspaper. “citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo nazis, and the kkk,” he added. cohn’s criticism came nearly two weeks after white supremacist and neo nazi activists clashed with anti racism protesters in charlottesville, virginia, over a plan to remove a statue of robert e. lee, a confederate general in the u.s. civil war. a man thought to have neo nazi sympathies drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen others. following the clashes, trump said there had been violence on “both sides,” remarks that spurred condemnation by both republican and democratic politicians.  cohn stood nearby during an impromptu trump tower news conference as the president insisted there were “very fine people on both sides” in charlottesville. cohn considered resigning over trump’s response, both newspapers reported, citing sources.  cohn went so far as to draft a resignation letter, the new york times reported, citing two people familiar with the document. cohn said he felt “compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks” and came under intense pressure to quit over trump’s reaction to the incident but decided against it. “as a jewish american, i will not allow neo nazis ranting ‘jews will not replace us’ to cause this jew to leave his job,” he said, referring to chants by neo nazis in charlottesville. “i feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. we must all unite together against them.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump told a group of senators on tuesday that he expected lawmakers would be able to reach a deal on healthcare, without offering specifics on how they would do it or what had changed since a healthcare reform bill was pulled last week for insufficient support. “i have no doubt that that’s going to happen very quickly,” trump said at a bipartisan reception held for senators and their spouses at the white house. “i think it’s going to happen because we’ve all been promising   democrat, republican   we’ve all been promising that to the american people,” he said. a republican plan backed by trump to overhaul the u.s. healthcare system was pulled on friday after it failed to garner enough support to pass the republican controlled house of representatives. trump, a republican, did not mention that failure at the reception nor did he offer specifics on how he planned for lawmakers to reach a consensus on a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the affordable care act, familiarly known as obamacare.  trump told lawmakers at the reception that he would be talking about infrastructure and investing in the military, without offering a time frame or details. “hopefully, it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. we want greatness for this country that we love,” he said.

" the united nations appealed on thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 muslims from myanmar who have fled to bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing . the rohingya are fleeing from a myanmar military offensive in the western state of rakhine that began after a series of guerrilla attacks on aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed.  we urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,  mohammed abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the international organisation for migration, told a news conference in the bangladeshi capital. the need was  massive , he added. the violence in rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year. u.n. secretary general antonio guterres and the u.n. security council on wednesday urged myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       the government of buddhist majority myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting  terrorists . numerous rohingya villages in the north of rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or buddhist civilians set the fires. they blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non muslim villagers were also displaced. smoke was rising from at least five places on the myanmar side of the border on thursday, a reuters reporter in bangladesh said. it was not clear what was burning or who set the fires.  ethnic cleansing  is not recognized as an independent crime under international law, the u.n. office on genocide prevention says, but it has been used in u.n. resolutions and acknowledged in judgments and indictments of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia. a u.n. panel of experts defined it as  rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups .       the crisis has raised questions about suu kyi s commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with western backers supporting her leadership of myanmar s transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation. critics have called for her to be stripped of her nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military. suu kyi is due to address the nation on tuesday. u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday he had spoken with suu kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to areas affected by violence. u.s. deputy assistant secretary of state patrick murphy had what one u.s. official called a  tough conversation  with myanmar s ambassador to the united states on wednesday ahead of murphy s trip to yangon this weekend. murphy will be meeting with myanmar government officials next week to voice concern about the state of the rohingya people and to press for greater access for humanitarian workers and reporters, the state department said. china, which competes with the united states for influence in myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an  internal affair , myanmar state media said.  the counterattacks of myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,  the global new light of myanmar newspaper quoted china s ambassador, hong liang, as telling government officials. but at the united nations in new york, china set a different tone, joining a security council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it. the council met on wednesday to discuss the crisis and later  expressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in rakhine, de escalate the situation, re establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem . this week, the trump administration called for protection of civilians. bangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in myanmar. myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable. the iom s abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in bangladesh.  the number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in myanmar does not improve,  he said. the most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said george william okoth obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the u.n. refugee agency.  the international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,  he told the news conference. on wednesday, the myanmar government said 45 places had been burned. it did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more. the spokesman, zaw htay, said the people going to bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict. government figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since aug. 25.

" lebanon s saad al hariri is expected to leave saudi arabia for france within 48 hours, before flying home to beirut to officially submit his resignation as lebanese prime minister, a source close to hariri told reuters on thursday. hariri announced his resignation in a televised broadcast from saudi arabia on nov. 4, and has not yet returned to lebanon. he said on wednesday he would return soon. lebanese president michel aoun tweeted on thursday that he hoped the country s political crisis was over following hariri s acceptance of the french invitation.  i await the return of pm hariri to beirut so we can decide on the situation of the government   if he wants to resign or rescind his resignation,  aoun said, according to presidential sources. aoun has previously said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to beirut to tender it and explain his reasons. the resignation of hariri pushed lebanon to the center of an intensifying regional rivalry between shi ite muslim iran and sunni saudi arabia. lebanese presidential sources quoted aoun on thursday as saying lebanon remained committed to its policy of  disassociation, especially among arab states . the disassociation policy is generally known in lebanon to mean staying out of regional conflicts. in his interview on sunday, hariri repeatedly called for disassociation to be respected. french president emmanuel macron said in a statement on wednesday that he had invited hariri to france after speaking to him and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman. the invitation is to visit for a few days and is not an offer of political exile, macron said, speaking in germany. hariri is expected to go to france with his family, the source close to hariri said. hariri traveled to riyadh on nov. 3 before abruptly resigning a day later, and he has remained in the saudi capital since then. top lebanese officials and senior politicians close to hariri have told reuters he was forced to quit. hariri and saudi arabia have both denied he is being held in riyadh or was coerced to resign.

" gulf carriers etihad airways and qatar airways said on saturday they will allow passengers barred from the united states by president donald trump’s executive order to board u.s. bound flights after a federal judge blocked the move. u.s. customs & border protection (cbp) has advised both airlines they can board travelers from seven muslim majority countries and all refugees who had been banned under the order, the airlines said. “acceptance will naturally be subject to checks completed by u.s. authorities as existed prior to the issuance of the executive order on 27 january,” an etihad spokesman told reuters in emailed comments. a qatar airways spokeswoman confirmed the airline was again accepting all passengers with valid travel documents. trump’s suspension on the entry of nationals from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen, and all refugees caught airlines off guard, with some carriers forced to re roster flight crew in order to abide by the order.

" u.s. president donald trump has signed an executive order to allow national monument designations to be rescinded or reduce the size of sites as the administration pushes to open up more federal land to drilling, mining and other development. trump’s order is part of an effort to reverse many of the  environmental protections implemented by his predecessor, democratic president barack obama that trump said were hobbling economic growth. trump’s agenda is being cheered by industry but enraging conservationists. legal challenges are expected because no president has ever rescinded a monument designation. in announcing the order on wednesday republican trump said obama’s use of the 1906 antiquities act to create monuments was an “egregious abuse of federal power” that allowed the federal government to “lock up” millions of acres of land and water. the antiquities act gives a president the authority to create national monuments from federal lands to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. “today we’re putting the states back in charge,” trump said, adding that they should decide which land is protected and which is open for development.   interior secretary ryan zinke told reporters late tuesday the order requires him to review about 30 national monuments created over the past two decades, and recommend which designations should be lifted or altered. the monuments covered under the review will range from the grand staircase created by president bill clinton in 1996 to the bears ears created by obama in december 2016, both in utah.   zinke said he will seek local feedback before making  recommendations, adding that reversing a monument designation could be tricky. “it is untested, as you know, whether the president can do that,” zinke said.     president woodrow wilson reduced the size of washington state’s mount olympus national monument in 1915, arguing there was an urgent need for timber at the time. zinke said he will review the bears ears monument first and make a recommendation to the president in 45 days. he has 120 days to issue a full report on all monuments to the president. bears ears protects native american cultural heritage and sacred sites. obama created the bears ears monument in the final days of his administration. utah’s governor and the state’s congressional delegation opposed the designation, saying it was done against the wishes of citizens eager for development. utah governor gary herbert, and senators mike lee and orin hatch, all republicans, stood beside trump as he signed the order. trump said the lawmakers lobbied him for the order. bears ears is near where texas based eog resources inc has been approved to drill. republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan praised the order. “i commend the trump administration for stopping this cycle of executive abuse and beginning a review of past designations,” he said.  conservation and tribal groups were critical. “with this review, the trump administration is walking into a legal, political and moral mine field,” said kate kelly, public lands director for the center for american progress.  democratic congressman raul grijalva of arizona, ranking member of the house natural resources committee, warned zinke not to make an “ideological” decision. he said previous monuments were decided “after years of close federal consultation with multiple local stakeholders.” the five native american tribes that pushed to create the bears ears monument to protect ancestral land said they will fight to protect it. the outdoor industry association, the trade group of the recreation industry, also attacked the order.  the group has estimated the outdoor recreation economy generates over $887 billion in consumer spending and creates 7.6 million jobs. “less than 24 hours after joining with our industry to celebrate the economic power of outdoor recreation, in a hypocritical move, the trump administration took unprecedented steps that could result in the removal of protections for treasured public lands,” said rose marcario, chief executive of outdoor gear retailer patagonia.   on friday, before the close of trump’s first 100 days in office, he is expected to sign an executive order that would review offshore areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration that have been restricted by previous presidents.

" hackers have probed the voting systems of many u.s. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data, homeland security secretary jeh johnson said on saturday. national security officials are investigating a number of possible leads suggesting that cyber criminals are trying to influence the nov. 8 presidential election, including by hacking into systems run by the democratic national committee. republican candidate donald trump has repeatedly charged that the u.s. election system is “rigged” and top democrats in congress have charged that russia is behind repeated attempts to access both party data and state voting systems. “in recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions,” johnson said in a statement. “in a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting related systems. however, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data.” the head of the democratic national committee, donna brazile, last month said the organization had been hacked by russian state sponsored agents who were trying to influence the election, when voters will choose between former secretary of state hillary clinton and trump, a new york real estate developer. debbie wasserman schultz resigned as dnc chair on the eve of july’s democratic national convention after wikileaks published a trove of hacked dnc emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee hillary clinton over senator bernie sanders during the party’s nominating contests.

" britain said on monday that comments by foreign secretary boris johnson about jailed iranian british aid worker nazanin zaghari ratcliffe should not be used by the islamic republic to bring additional charges against her. johnson told the british parliament s foreign affairs committee last wednesday that zaghari ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism, a statement that the thomson reuters foundation, a charity organization for which she works, said was incorrect.  last week s remarks by the foreign secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against nazanin zaghari ratcliffe,  a spokesman for the british foreign office said.  while criticizing the iranian case against mrs zaghari ratcliffe, the foreign secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment.  zaghari ratcliffe, a project manager, is serving a five year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment. she was brought again into court on saturday, three days after johnson s remarks, and accused by a judge of  spreading propaganda against the regime .  she is not a journalist and has never trained journalists at the thomson reuters foundation where she is project manager in my media development team,  monique villa, thomson reuters foundation chief executive, said in a statement.  i see a direct correlation between this statement by boris johnson, who rightly condemned the treatment that nazanin has received in iran, and the fact that nazanin was brought once again into court on saturday 4 november.  the charges against nazanin were denied by her family and the foundation, a charity organization that is independent of thomson reuters and operates independently of reuters news. tulip siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition labour party, said johnson had failed to retract his comments, which she said had undermined efforts to secure zaghari ratcliffe s release.  by suggesting nazanin was in iran  teaching people journalism , boris johnson has endangered the cause to secure her release,  siddiq, who is the lawmaker for the area where zaghari ratcliffe lived in london, said in an emailed statement.  the foreign secretary s failure to retract his comments to the foreign affairs select committee is unforgivable,  siddiq said.  his comments were both untrue and unhelpful to her case.  the iranian embassy in london could not be reached for comment.

" merrick garland hit an unwanted milestone on tuesday as the federal appeals court judge’s nomination to the u.s. supreme court reached its 125th day with no senate action, tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court.  in a move with little precedent in american history, the republicans who control the senate have simply refused to take any action on president barack obama’s nomination of garland, 63, for a lifetime job on the nation’s top court.  having been nominated on march 16 to replace conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13, garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington, has now matched louis brandeis for the longest time between nomination and senate action.  in 1916, the senate voted to confirm brandeis, making him america’s first jewish justice.  the u.s. constitution assigns the senate the power to confirm the president’s nominations to the supreme court. the senate’s inaction on garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year.  republicans, hopeful of winning back the white house from the democrats in the nov. 8 election, insist that obama’s successor name scalia’s replacement, who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives.  obama has appointed two of the current justices: liberals elena kagan and sonia sotomayor.  the white house and its allies made another push on tuesday to highlight republican intransigence.  “now, despite chief judge garland’s extraordinary qualifications, republicans in the senate have refused to do their job, and chief judge garland’s nomination has now been pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history who’s nomination was not otherwise withdrawn,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters.  “despite his outstanding record and qualifications, republicans have obstructed judge garland’s nomination in a way faced by no other supreme court nominee in our nation’s history,” added senate democratic leader harry reid.  the senate is on recess until september.  for the rival presidential hopefuls, republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton, the supreme court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity.  in addition to scalia’s replacement, the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices. three of the court’s current eight members already are over age 77. that means obama’s successor could influence the court’s ideological direction for decades.  some conservatives view trump with suspicion. but the wealthy new york real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right.  garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. some liberal democrats have said clinton, if elected, could put forth a nominee more liberal than garland, so republicans would be smart to approve him before obama leaves office on jan. 20.  such arguments have not swayed republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who refuses to let garland come to a vote.  the development most likely to prod senate action is the result of the presidential election. some republican senators have said if clinton wins, the senate should confirm garland in a “lame duck” post election session out of fear clinton would name someone far more liberal. if clinton wins, she also could renominate garland upon taking office.  garland’s nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the supreme court, as there have been with some nominees in the past. he is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both democrats and republicans as a moderate.  the white house tried to persuade republicans to accept garland when he was first nominated in march. he met with 61 of the 100 senators. but the effort fizzled, and republicans largely followed mcconnell’s lead.  the white house since then has tried to keep the garland nomination in the public eye, with limited success. obama wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal on monday, pushing for senate action.  a white house allied group called the constitutional responsibility project is running a “we need nine” campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court. it has bought ads in cleveland, where the republican presidential nominating convention began on monday, calling for senators to “do your job” and bring garland’s nomination to a senate vote.  in the meantime, garland is nowhere to be seen. his last public appearance was on june 15 when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in washington.  when

" u.s. president donald trump’s failure to fill dozens of senior level positions at the pentagon is making it difficult for defense contractors to forecast business.  defense company officials, speaking on conference calls after their just reported quarterly earnings, did not blame trump directly, but said the lack of appointments to key positions at the pentagon had slowed contract awards and created uncertainty. “the still high number of unfilled leadership appointments and the approaching government physical year end continue to serve as headwinds,” said roger krone, chief executive of leidos holdings inc (ldos.n), on an aug. 3 call with analysts. krone, whose company is one of the largest providers of services to u.s. armed forces, said those open posts have slowed the awarding of government contracts. the department of defense said it has 42 unfilled top level posts that require senate confirmation, including general counsel, inspector general and other important roles like secretary of the army and undersecretary of the navy. the pentagon referred a request for comment on its unfilled posts to the white house. a white house official said: “democrat obstruction has played a key role in jamming up the president’s agenda.”  of the 42 open positions that require senate confirmation, 29 have no nominee identified, while 13 have nominees awaiting confirmation. for two of the largest u.s. defense companies, general dynamics corp (gd.n) and l3 technologies inc (lll.n), thin staffing at their largest customer was a talking point with investors. the defense department is “working on filling several positions in the pentagon and that has definitely resulted in a slowdown,” said ralph d’ambrosio, chief financial officer of l3, a prime contractor for surveillance, security and detection systems. because of the slowdown, the quarter just ended was the lowest second quarter spending level on record at $62.5 billion, according to a report by data analysis firm govini, seen by reuters. the report said “federal procurement resources are stretched thinner than they ever have been.”  leidos’ krone pointed to the expected one year delay of the navy’s $3.5 billion nmci nextgen program to update the intranet used by the u.s. navy and marine corps as an example of a big contract delay. defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year and beyond was unclear, said byron callan, a defense analyst at capital alpha partners, noting that few companies have changed their long term profit expectations, suggesting that uncertainty has made forecasting more difficult.  “the fact that we didn’t have an enacted (fiscal year) 2017 budget until the early part of may, which was seven months into the fiscal year, has definitely slowed down the contracting activity and the obligation activity within the department of defense,” said d’ambrosio. some of the positions have been difficult to fill. two of trump’s nominees for army secretary, its top professional civilian position, withdrew their names from consideration. the white house then nominated raytheon co (rtn.n) lobbyist mark esper, and he is awaiting a vote on his confirmation. general dynamics ceo phebe novakovic said during her company’s conference call that “without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts” and to make progress on defense related projects.  novakovic’s information systems and technology business unit has thousands of shorter sales cycle service contracts which can reflect delays quickly.

" failure to ratify the u.s. led sweeping trade pact tpp would hand china “the keys to the castle” on globalization and do nothing to solve the real problems underlying american anxiety over jobs, the top u.s. trade official said thursday. the tariff slashing trans pacific partnership (tpp) has turned into a hot button topic in the run up to the nov. 8 u.s. election, threatening to dampen support from lawmakers needed to pass a deal critics condemn as a job killer. u.s. trade representative michael froman said he was still optimistic congress would pass the 12 member tpp, in part because china has been moving ahead with a trade deal of its own, the regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep), that would boost its exports and let it set labor and environmental standards in the fast growing asia pacific region. “we’re one vote away from either cementing our leadership in this region and in the global trading system or ceding it to china,” froman told reporters in lima after attending the inauguration of peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski.  “at the end of the day i don’t think congress wants to be responsible for handing the keys to the castle to china.” froman’s defense of the tpp follows weeks of heated attacks on the deal as anti tpp chants and signs have peppered the republican and democratic conventions. republican nominee donald trump has called the tpp a “death blow” for manufacturing jobs and his democratic rival hillary clinton has firmed up her opposition to it in recent days. froman declined to comment on the candidates but said the tpp had become a “scapegoat” for legitimate concerns over income inequality, stagnant wages and jobs lost to automation. “you don’t get to vote on the next generation of robots,” he said, “you get to vote on trade agreements”. but the debate over tpp has also helped broaden support for domestic policies, such as infrastructure development and educational programs, to help americans adapt to rapid economic change, froman said. u.s. president barack obama wants the tpp passed this year. froman ruled out renegotiating the “carefully balanced” text, but said issues were being solved by working on country implementation plans. he cited pork producers, dairy farmers and financial services as once reluctant stakeholders that now back the tpp. “the last major issue outstanding has to do with biologics and intellectual property rights,” froman said. “we’re having good constructive conversations” with members of congress.

" it is not yet clear if britain and the european union can agree on written assurances to avoid a hard northern ireland border by a monday deadline, irish foreign minister simon coveney said on sunday.  but he said he was hopeful a meeting between british prime minister theresa may and european council president donald tusk on monday would lead to a deal in time for a dec. 14 15 eu summit. that would allow britain to move on to talks on its future trading relations with the bloc.  avoiding a so called hard border on the island of ireland is the last major hurdle before talks begin on the future trade relationship and a two year brexit transition. tusk said he had asked may to  put a final offer on the table  by monday, but coveney suggested agreement on the wording of written reassurances may come later.   the hope is that those [monday] meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders  summit the week after ... and can allow this brexit negotiation process to open up to phase two of discussions,  coveney told rte radio. asked if he expected an agreed text of written british assurances on the issue monday morning, coveney said:  let s not run before we can walk here. obviously, we would like that to be the case.      the irish cabinet is to meet at 0900 gmt on monday and give prime minister leo varadkar a mandate to make a decision on the border issue.   that may or may not be on the back of an agreed wording. that remains to be seen over the next number of hours,  coveney said. ireland is not asking the british government to  do the impossible  and provide a detailed plan border will work, but rather for  clear principles  for the second phase of talks to eliminate the possibility of a hard border.   what we have to make sure here is that we don t have an unintended consequence of the re emergence of a [hard] border,  he said.  we can t allow that and we won t allow that.

" president donald trump and his fellow republicans who control congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a u.s. government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed mexican border wall as well as obamacare funding. with republicans controlling the white house and both chambers of congress, keeping the federal government operating is a basic test of their ability to govern, but their task could become even more complicated if they insist on using the spending legislation to bring about contentious policy changes. not only must republicans overcome intraparty ideological divisions that stopped major healthcare legislation last month, but they will have to win over some opposition democrats with provisions that could be distasteful to conservatives. with the senate reconvening on monday and the house of representatives on tuesday after a two week recess, lawmakers will have only four days to pass a spending package to keep the government open beyond april 28, when funding expires for numerous federal programs. “i think we want to keep the government open,” trump said on thursday, adding he thinks congress can pass the funding legislation and perhaps also a revamped healthcare bill. democratic support depends on what provisions republicans demand in the bill. democrats have signaled they would not cooperate if it contains money for one of trump’s top priorities, a southwestern border wall intended to combat illegal immigration, or if it ends federal subsidies to help low income people buy health insurance under the affordable care act, known as obamacare, which republicans want to repeal. democrats also want federal funds maintained for planned parenthood, which many republicans oppose because the women’s healthcare provider performs abortions. another obstacle would be if trump demands large defense spending increases coupled with deep cuts to domestic programs democrats want to protect. late on thursday, leading house democrats were voicing skepticism a deal could be reached by the deadline. in a telephone call for house democrats, representative nita lowey, the senior democrat on the house appropriations committee, said: “i don’t see how we can meet that deadline” and avoid having to pass a short term extension, according to an aide on the call. the second ranking house democrat, representative steny hoyer, told his fellow democrats that they should only support such a short term measure if a deal on long term bill is reached and only finishing touches remained, the aide said. republican leaders face a familiar balancing act: satisfying the party’s most conservative members while not alienating its moderates. rules in the 100 seat senate mean trump’s party also would need the support of at least eight democrats even if the republicans remain unified, giving the opposition party leverage. house republican leaders would need some democratic votes if the most conservative lawmakers object to the bill, as they did to the healthcare plan championed by speaker paul ryan. with congressional elections looming next year, republicans acknowledge the stakes are high. “even our most recalcitrant members understand that if you shut down the government while you’re running it and you control the house and the senate, you can’t blame anybody but yourself,” said representative tom cole, a senior house appropriations committee republican. white house budget director mick mulvaney said the trump administration was willing to talk to democrats about funding for obamacare subsidies in exchange for their agreement to include some trump priorities such as the wall, the defense hike and more money for immigration enforcement. “it is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and democrats some of their priorities. so we think we’ve opened the door for that,” mulvaney said. democrats reacted negatively. “everything had been moving smoothly until the administration moved in with a heavy hand. not only are democrats opposed to the wall, there is significant republican opposition as well,” said matt house, a spokesman for senate democratic leader chuck schumer. the government was last forced to close in october 2013, when republican senator ted cruz and some of the most conservative house republicans engineered a 17 day shutdown in an unsuccessful quest to kill democratic former president barack obama’s healthcare law. “these kind of bills can’t pass without a reasonable number of the party of the minority in the senate, and we are optimistic we will be able to work all that out,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said at the start of the spring recess. a deal is needed because congress was unable to approve funding for the entire 2017 fiscal year that ends in september and has relied on stop gap spending legislation. congress has passed no major legislation since trump took office in january, and he has ambitious hopes for major tax cut legislation, infrastructure spending and other bills. with the difficulty passing a bill with so many divisive elements, lawmakers next week might need to buy time by passing a short term bill lasting possibly one to three weeks, maintaining current spending levels. “that would be a setback: not catastrophic, but not a good thing, and a sign that you can’t govern,” cole said. a federal closure would shutter national park service destinations like the statue of liberty, yellowstone and the grand canyon. government medical research would be suspended. thousands of federal workers would be furloughed with thousands more working without pay until the shutdown ends, including homeland security personnel. some veterans benefits could be suspended. time would stand still in the u.s. capitol with nobody on duty to wind the 200 year old “ohio clock” just outside the senate chamber.

" irish prime minister leo varadkar s fine gael party surged into an 11 point lead in a poll on thursday, gaining credit for the government s brexit negotiating stance and indicating its recent near collapse had not hurt his popularity. varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over britain s withdrawl from the european union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the irish border on monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as london wants. that was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before christmas, an episode that members of fine gael feared would damage both the party and its leader. yet support for fine gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the irish times/mrbi poll, while fellow centre right rival fianna fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since october. the left wing sinn fein party was unchanged on 19 percent.  the most recent survey taken by another polling company,  conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck. the number of undecided voters was far higher in the mrbi sample. satisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in thursday s poll, the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade.  today s poll proves that timing is everything,  said mrbi director aisling corcoran.  interviewing took place on monday and tuesday against the backdrop of brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination.

" fbi director james comey on thursday defended his handling of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s email investigation during the contentious u.s. presidential election, according to a message to fbi staff reported by abc news. comey and the federal bureau of investigation came under criticism from republicans and democrats amid its investigation into democrat hillary clinton’s use of a personal email server while u.s. secretary of state.  “i would be lying if i said the external criticism doesn’t bother me at all, but the truth is, it doesn’t bother me much because of the way we made the decision,” comey said in the new year’s message, abc reported. “at every turn last year, we were faced with choosing among bad options and making decisions we knew would bring a torrent of criticism.” the most furious criticism came after comey disclosed that the fbi was examining a trove of newly discovered clinton emails just 11 days before the nov. 8 vote.  the new trove did not change the fbi’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against clinton, comey said a week later. but clinton cited his decision as a turning point that cost her the election to republican businessman donald trump.

" the son of malta s best known investigative journalist said on tuesday his mother had been killed by a car bomb because of her work exposing political corruption, as hundreds of people demonstrated to demand justice after her death. daphne caruana galizia, who wrote about graft across malta s political divides on her blog, died when explosives ripped through her car minutes after she left her home in the north of the island on monday afternoon. maltese authorities were waiting for the arrival of dutch forensic experts and american fbi agents to help the investigations.  my mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists,  matthew caruana galizia said on facebook.  she was also targeted because she was the only person doing so,  he added. he described rushing to the scene, only to find the burning car and her remains. maltese prime minister joseph muscat, who was accused of wrong doing by caruana galizia earlier this year and had been suing her over some of her allegations, denounced her killing and pledged to track down those responsible. but a small group booed muscat on tuesday evening when he left his office, and the opposition is calling for him to resign.  the prime minister and his government have been responsible for diminishing the rule of law in malta,  opposition leader adrian delia told reuters.  they have created an environment where people are afraid to speak out.  on tuesday afternoon, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the law courts demanding justice for caruana galizia s killers.  the state did not defend daphne,  shouted andrew borg cardona, addressing the crowd. he said those who accused her of  going over the top  with her investigations  are all guilty . one woman carried a votive lamp with the murdered journalist s picture in it and another carried a sign that read  looks like we can t have freedom of speech but we want justice . recently, caruana galizia had been following up leads from information in the so called panama papers, a large collection of documents from an offshore law firm in the central american nation that were leaked in 2015. she was tracing alleged links between maltese officials and offshore banks and companies used as tax havens. half an hour before the explosion, caruana galizia wrote on her blog:  there are crooks everywhere you look now. the situation is desperate.  the european commission told journalists it was horrified by the murder in the bloc s smallest state and called for justice. spokesman margaritis schinas was asked if the commission would open a procedure to check if malta was meeting the eu s standards for the rule of law, a process now being applied to poland over judicial reforms there. he replied:  we never speculate on these questions. these are very serious subjects ... this is an outrageous act that happened, and what matters now is that justice will be brought.   this is what we need to see.  the killing near the village of bidnija stunned the mediterranean island. authorities said it was the first murder of a journalist there.  i saw a small explosion coming from the car and i panicked. a few seconds later, around three to four seconds, there was another, larger explosion,  said resident frans sant, who was driving in the other direction.  the car continued coming down the hill, skidding at high speed, full of fire. the car missed me by around 10 feet. i tried to help, but the fire was too much and the car ended up in the field,  he told reuters television.

" members of the house freedom caucus called on congressional leaders friday to introduce a formal tax reform proposal by the end of july, and suggested they could support a 2018 budget deal in exchange for adding welfare reform to any tax overhaul. the conservative bloc, which has enough members to stymie legislation in the republican controlled house of representatives, will play a key role in efforts to agree on a 2018 fiscal plan that could determine whether president donald trump and congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the reagan era. the caucus has already called on republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping congress in session through august, when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break.   “we need to get tax reform done sooner than later, and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of july,” representative chairman mark meadows, chairman of the freedom caucus, told a heritage foundation forum. meadows recommended that republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by house speaker paul ryan to move the tax debate forward.  a border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the u.s. trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit. trump, however, did not include a border adjustment tax in his proposed budget. representative jim jordan, freedom caucus co founder, said tax reform could have trouble moving forward because house republicans are having trouble agreeing on a budget with reconciliation instructions needed to allow republicans to bypass democrats in passing a tax overhaul. “if you don’t get a budget agreement, you can’t get reconciliation. if you don’t have reconciliation, you can’t get tax reform,” jordan told the forum. he suggested that freedom caucus members could agree to higher budget spending levels if reconciliation instructions included welfare reforms intended to save $400 billion in spending over a decade.  “we think that is the key to unlocking this road block that we’re in. i don’t see any other way out of it to get a budget agreement,” jordan said. meanwhile, meadows voiced support for allowing u.s. corporations to repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in cash held overseas at a reduced 8 percent tax rate. meadows said the caucus does not plan to support a proposal that would allow full expensing for corporations, a policy backed by house republican leaders. the policy, which would allow companies to write off capital investments immediately, would be too expensive without the border adjustment tax and revenue raising proposals that caucus members oppose.

" u.s. president elect donald trump will name former georgia governor sonny perdue as his nominee for secretary of agriculture on thursday, a senior transition official said on wednesday. perdue, 70, served on trump’s agricultural advisory committee during his presidential campaign. his nomination, which must be confirmed by the republican led senate, will complete trump’s proposed cabinet just before he is sworn in as president on friday. by nominating a former governor from a southern state, trump eschewed candidates from major farm belt states in the midwest that produce the bulk of crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat which dominate agriculture exports. georgia is a key producer of crops such as cotton and peanuts. while georgia governor, perdue had to handle a severe drought in 2007, during which he took steps to cut water usage and at one point led a service outside the state capitol to pray for rain. perdue, a republican, was elected twice as governor, serving from 2003 to 2011. before that, he was in the state senate representing a rural swath of the state about 100 miles (160 km) south of atlanta. he switched political parties from democratic to republican in 1998 amid redistricting in the state and shifting demographics. trump received strong support from the agricultural community as the farm economy slumped amid falling prices for key commodities. ron moore, president of the american soybean association (asa), said he thought perdue would support agriculture exports. “i think he will be very much in favor of trade,” moore said in a telephone interview. the asa, with 15 other farm groups,  this month urged the incoming administration to “protect and enhance” agricultural trade and its impact on the rural economy. trade, a signature issue during the campaign in which trump accused china of unfair practices, is critical for the farm economy. u.s. farm and food exports to china were more than $20.2 billion in 2015.  prices for soybeans rose 16.2 percent during 2016 on strong demand from china, which buys nearly 30 percent of the u.s. crop. soybean exports helped boost u.s. gross domestic product in the third quarter. some farmers are concerned that trump’s criticism of china could lead to deteriorating trade relations and put exports at risk. an influential chinese state run newspaper warned this week that u.s. agricultural imports and u.s. aircraft manufacturer boeing co could be targets for retaliation in any trade war ushered in by trump. zippy duvall, president of the american farm bureau, praised perdue as a strong voice. but environmental groups opposed the nominee. “farmers need a champion in the usda who will fight for conservation programs to help farmers be more resilient in the face of extreme weather, not pray for rain,” kari hamerschlag, deputy director of food and technology at friends of the earth, said in a statement. after finishing his second term as governor, perdue founded perdue partners, a global trading firm that consults and provides services for companies looking to export products. his cousin david perdue is serving his first term representing georgia in the u.s. senate. the nominee is not related to chicken magnate frank perdue.

" former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh said on saturday he was ready for a  new page  in relations with the saudi led coalition fighting in yemen if it stopped attacks on his country. the call came as his supporters battled houthi fighters for a fourth day in the capital sanaa while both sides traded blame for a widening rift between allies that could affect the course of the civil war. together they have fought the saudi led coalition which intervened in yemen in 2015 aiming to restore the internationally recognized government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi after the houthis forced him into exile. the clashes between saleh s supporters and the houthis underscore the complex situation in yemen, one of the poorest countries in the middle east, where a proxy war between the iran aligned houthis and the saudi backed hadi has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times.  i call upon the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded and we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness,  saleh said in a televised speech.  we will deal with them in a positive way and what happened to yemen is enough,  he added. saleh, who was forced to step down by a 2011 mass uprising against his 33 years in office, said yemen s parliament, which is dominated by his gpc party, was the only legitimate power in the country and was ready for talks with the coalition. the saudi led coalition welcomed saleh s change of stance. in a statement carried by the saudi owned al hadath channel, the coalition said it was  confident of the will of the leaders and sons  of saleh s general people s congress (gpc) party to return to arab fold.  the coalition accuses non arab iran of trying to expand its influence into arab countries, including yemen, which shares a long border with saudi arabia, by aligning themselves with the houthis and saleh. the houthis accused saleh of betrayal, and vowed to keep up the fight against the saudi led coalition.  it is not strange or surprising that saleh turns back on a partnership he never believed in,  the group s political bureau said in a statement.  the priority has been and still is to confront the forces of aggression.  residents of sanaa described heavy fighting on the streets of hadda, a southern residential district of the yemeni capital where many of saleh s relatives live, early on saturday, with sounds of explosions and gunfire heard while the streets were deserted.  the fighting eased in the afternoon as saleh supporters gained the upper hand, but intermittent gunfire was being heard. there was no immediate word on casualties. both sides have reported that at least 16 people were killed in the fighting, which began on wednesday when armed houthi fighters entered the main mosque complex, firing rpgs and grenades. saleh s gpc party accused the houthis of failing to honor a truce and said in a statement on its website that the houthis bear responsibility for dragging the country into a civil war. it also called on supporters, including tribal fighters, to  defend themselves, their country, their revolution and their republic...  the gpc appealed to the army and security forces to remain neutral in the conflict. but the head of the houthis  ansarullah group warned that the biggest winner from what he described as saleh s  sedition  was the saudi led coalition.  i appeal to the leader saleh to show more wisdom and maturity... and not to heed incitement calls,  abdel malek al houthi said in a speech on the group s al masirah tv, adding that his group was ready to sit down for arbitration and abide by any ruling. yemen s civil war has killed more than 10,000 people since 2015, displaced more than two million people, caused a cholera outbreak infecting nearly one million people and put the country on the brink of famine.

" the u.s. congress will pass legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling and lawmakers have a number of options for avoiding default, house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday. “we will pass legislation to make sure we pay our debts and we will not hit the debt ceiling. we’ll do this before the debt ceiling,” ryan said during a tax reform event at a boeing plant in washington state. “there are many different options in front of us on how we achieve that,” he added. “we pay our debts in this country. we will continue to do so.” later, in an interview with cnbc, ryan said he had considered the option of attaching legislation raising the debt ceiling to a measure congress passed recently extending money to veterans’ programs. the comments came after president donald trump said on twitter that congress could have avoided a “mess” if ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had taken his advice to link the debt ceiling and veterans’ funding measure. “that’s an option we were looking at but the va deadline came up and we weren’t able to do that then,” ryan told cnbc. congress passed the veterans’ measure in early august and trump signed it august 12. “i’m really not that worried about this, we have plenty of options ahead of us” to raise the debt ceiling, ryan said, adding that he did not interpret trump’s tweets as “going after me.” the speaker sidestepped a question as to whether the options included a “clean” hike of the debt ceiling, saying he did not want to “negotiate to the media.” house conservative republicans have been pushing for a variety of add ons to a debt limit bill, such as deep spending cuts or the sale of government assets. the government bumped up against its statutory limit on borrowing at just under $20 trillion in march. since then, treasury secretary steven mnuchin has had to take “extraordinary” measures to stave off a default until congress agrees to raise the treasury’s borrowing capability.    the trump administration had been hoping congress would pass a debt limit bill before embarking on a long summer recess.

" the united states will send about 3,500 additional u.s. troops to afghanistan, u.s. officials said on wednesday, a figure broadly in line with expectations as the united states boosts support for the afghan military. the disclosure by the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, comes as defense secretary jim mattis and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff marine general joseph dunford hold closed door briefings with members of congress about president donald trump s regional strategy. the pentagon said it would not comment on additional troop numbers until mattis makes an announcement. if confirmed, it would bring the total number of u.s. troops in afghanistan to about 14,500. after a months long review of his afghanistan policy, trump committed the united states last week to an open ended conflict in the country and promised a stepped up campaign against taliban insurgents. last week mattis said he had signed orders to send additional troops to afghanistan but did not specify the size of the force, saying he first needed to brief congress. u.s. officials have for months told reuters that trump had given mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to afghanistan. the u.s. presence in afghanistan peaked at more than 100,000 troops in 2011, when washington was under domestic political pressure to draw down the costly operation. some u.s. officials have told reuters they questioned the benefit of sending more troops to afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. to date, more than 2,300 americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded in afghanistan.

" human rights monitors on wednesday urged myanmar to withdraw a  ban on protests in its largest city, yangon, amid fears that free speech is under pressure under the government led by democracy champion aung san suu kyi.  suu kyi led efforts to end decades of military rule and won a landmark election in the buddhist majority country in 2015, but her civilian government shares power with the military and has no control over the army and police. she has also been roundly criticised in the west for failing to rein in the military over its alleged role in atrocities  against minority rohingya muslims which the united nations has described as textbook ethnic cleansing. the ban on protests, issued this month by a military controlled ministry, restricts all applications for processions or assemblies in central yangon in order to avoid  public annoyance and anxiety  and  disturbance of traffic , according to official documents reviewed by reuters.      the curb came weeks before pope francis  visit to yangon, when he is expected to raise the rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled the country after a myanmar army offensive in august.  it underscores rising concerns over free speech after recent arrests of journalists and activists in myanmar.   there is no legitimate reason for imposing a ban on all protests in major sections of burma s largest city,  said brad adams, asia director at human rights watch, referring to myanmar by its old name.   this directive was issued by a military officer and should be seen by the civilian government as a direct challenge to its commitment to basic rights for burmese citizens. the government needs to reverse this ban and uphold the rule of law and refuse to capitulate to arbitrary actions by the military.  the order, issued by yangon region security and border affairs minister colonel aung soe moe, instructs authorities in 11 townships to deny all applications for assemblies. it does not say how long the curb will last.  a senior official from the military run general administration department in yangon s ahlone township confirmed that his office has received the order. he declined to be named as he s not authorized to speak to the media.     reuters was unable to contact yangon s police deputy chief by telephone. the office of yangon s chief minister phyo min thein declined to comment. a myanmar court last week jailed for two months two journalists along with their interpreter and driver for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone. police on sunday arrested an ultra nationalist buddhist monk who has a history of stoking sentiment against the rohingya.  since suu kyi s government took power last year, 93 people including journalists and activists have been charged or arrested under a controversial law that some worry is used to curb criticism of the authorities, according to advocacy group research team for telecommunications law.

" president donald trump on thursday named andrew wheeler, a coal industry lobbyist and former congressional staffer, as his pick for deputy administrator of the u.s. environmental protection agency, prompting contrasting reactions from industry and environmental groups. the sierra club, an environmental group, called his nomination, which is subject to senate confirmation,  “absolutely horrifying,” while a coal industry group and some republican politicians said he was well qualified for the job. the epa said in a statement wheeler had spent four years at the agency’s office of pollution prevention and toxics during the george h. w. bush and clinton administrations, as well as many years on capitol hill, including as counsel for conservative republican senator james inhofe. it said he currently works as a principal at faegrebd consulting, “providing guidance on federal regulatory and legislative environmental and energy issues.”   inhofe said in the statement that no one is more qualified than wheeler to help epa administrator scott pruitt “restore epa to its proper size and scope.” the american coalition for clean coal electricity, an industry lobby group, called wheeler extraordinarily qualified for the job, saying in a statement: “his understanding of a wide range of environmental policies and the policy development process — combined with his thoughtfulness, judgment and temperament — will enable him to be an outstanding deputy administrator.” but the sierra club called his nomination “absolutely horrifying,” adding in a statement: “andrew wheeler is a big time lobbyist who has represented big coal for almost a decade, including in numerous lawsuits challenging the epa. he is a friend to polluters, not to american families that rely on clean air and clean water.”  pruitt led 14 lawsuits against the agency when he was oklahoma’s attorney general, and has said he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change, a position widely embraced by scientists. he was appointed by president donald trump, a climate change doubter, who campaigned on a pledge to boost the u.s. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by reducing regulation.  he also promised to pull washington out of a global pact to fight climate change, which he did in june.

" the trump administration on friday sided with employers in a supreme court case over the rights of workers to bring class action lawsuits against companies, court documents showed.  reversing a position staked out earlier by the obama administration, which backed employees, the administration said in a court filing it would no longer defend the position of the national labor relations board (nlrb) that employment agreements requiring workers to waive their rights to bring class action claims are invalid. the waivers compel workers to individually arbitrate disputes with their employers rather than bring collective lawsuits with their co workers.  the nlrb, an independent agency in the federal government, said in letter to the court on thursday that its own lawyer would represent the board in the employees’ class action rights case. it is unusual for the government to change positions in a case already pending at the supreme court, and marks a sharp break from the administration of former president barack obama, a democrat, which had originally pursued the case on behalf of the nlrb. the nlrb currently has a democratic majority, isolating it politically from the republican trump administration.  in january the supreme court agreed to review three lower court rulings, including one involving global professional services firm ernst & young, over the legality of the waivers. employers have increasingly required workers to sign them as part of their arbitration agreements to guard against the rising tide of worker lawsuits seeking unpaid wages. in friday’s court filing, acting u.s. solicitor general jeffrey wall said the supreme court should find that class action waivers are legal and enforceable under federal law. workers that waive the right to collective litigation cannot “escape the consequences of that choice,” he said.  companies say the waivers allow for speedier and more cost effective resolution of workplace disputes. class action litigation, on the other hand, is harder to fight and can lead to large damages awards.  workers argue that pursuing their cases individually is prohibitively expensive and, without the prospect of large damages awards that class action litigation can lead to, lawyers will be deterred from taking their cases. the nine supreme court justices are expected to issue a ruling on the issue in the court’s next term, which starts in october and ends in june 2018.

" a libyan coast guard vessel fired shots and boarded a humanitarian ship in the mediterranean on tuesday, demanding that the migrants on board be handed over to them, a spokesman for the mission lifeline charity said.  the libyan man said:  this is our territory,  said axel steier, a spokesman for the german based charity that performed its first rescues on tuesday.  after a while, they fired shots,  he said, probably into the air or sea. no one was wounded. afterward two libyans boarded the lifeline ship to try to persuade them to hand over some 70 migrants they had just taken off a wooden boat in international waters.   we told them we don t return migrants to libya. after a while, they gave up,  steier said. the two men spent about 15 minutes on board, he said. a libyan coast guard spokesman in tripoli declined to comment, saying he was seeking information. italy s coast guard, which coordinates rescues, did not respond to repeated telephone calls. it was the latest incident reported between the libyan coast guard and humanitarian rescue ships operating off north africa. financed, trained and equipped by italy, the tripoli based coastguard is intercepting a growing number of migrant boats. last month, the libyan coast guard ordered a spanish rescue vessel to sail to tripoli or risk being fired upon, though it later let it go. the worsening security situation has prompted several groups to halt rescue operations, and those who remain tend to patrol further from shore.     this year the libyan coast guard had stopped 16,567 people before they were rescued and taken to italy, according to the international organization for migration. but overall departures are down more than 20 percent and they dropped more than 80 percent in august after an armed group in sabratha clamped down on smuggling. italy is counting on the libyan coast guard together with the tripoli and municipal governments to put a halt to migrant arrivals from a country that has been torn by civil war and factional fighting since the ouster of muammar gaddafi in 2011.  the policy has been harshly criticized by humanitarian groups because of the dire conditions of libya s detention centers and the inhumane treatment of migrants in general in libya. despite recent declines in departures, almost 1,000 migrants were rescued on tuesday. save the children s vos hestia ship picked up some 750 people in six different rescues, a spokeswoman said, and the lifeline had more than 200 on board. sos mediterranee s aquarius ship picked up 20 libyans on monday.   there is no longer any work in libya and you risk being attacked,  a 26 year old libyan rescued told members of the sos crew.  it is impossible to live in libya, it has become too dangerous.

" country star garth brooks is in discussions to perform at the inauguration of u.s. president elect donald trump, the singer’s representative said on friday, as organizers of the event denied media reports that they were struggling to find a list stars to take part. brooks, 54, one of the world’s best selling solo artists, performed for democrat barack obama’s inauguration in 2009, along with a line up that included bruce springsteen, u2, beyonce, and stevie wonder. “garth has performed for the five living presidents,” his publicist nancy seltzer said on friday. “while rumor has it that he has been asked to perform for president elect trump, he has not been able to commit yet.” no celebrities have yet been announced as taking part in the jan. 20 inauguration. brooks, a country hall of famer with u.s. sales of more than 135 million albums, is currently in hawaii as part of a world tour. he is due to perform in cincinnati, ohio on jan. 21   the day after the inauguration in washington. asked on camera by celebrity website tmz earlier this week if he would sing for trump, brooks replied “it’s always about serving. it’s what you do.” brooks stayed silent during the divisive election in which most stars, including beyonce, katy perry, jay z and jennifer lopez, threw their support behind democrat hillary clinton. hollywood trade publication variety suggested on friday that the inaugural committee would have its work cut out trying to match the celebrity turnout for obama in 2009 given the opposition of much of hollywood to trump. elton john’s spokeswoman last month denied a claim by one member of trump’s team that the british singer would perform. boris epshteyn, communications director for trump’s inaugural committee, on friday denied it was having problems assembling talent. “we have world class talent, world class entertainers reaching out to us offering their help, offering their services so no struggle, whatsoever,” epshteyn told abc television news. the inaugural committee on friday announced that the theme for the jan. 20 celebrations would be “make america great again”   the republican businessman’s campaign slogan. the committee said trump would attend two official inaugural balls on jan. 20, down from the 10 attended by obama. “this is a workman like inaugural. this is not a coronation,” epshteyn said. “and you’ve seen some inaugurals in the past that maybe did seem like a coronation. again, it’s every president’s choice. this president wants to get to work.” (corrects quote in third para to clarify brooks has performed for five presidents, not five inaugurations.)

" the united states has told russia to close its consulate in san francisco and buildings in washington and new york that house trade missions, the state department said on thursday, in retaliation for moscow cutting the u.s. diplomatic presence in russia. the announcement was the latest in tit for tat measures between the two countries that have helped to drive relations to a new post cold war low, thwarting hopes on both sides that they might improve after u.s. president donald trump took office in january. last month, moscow ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of russian diplomats in the united states, after congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against russia. the sanctions were imposed in response to russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and to punish russia further for its 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine.  we believe this action was unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries,  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement on thursday, adding that the united states had completed the reduction.  in the spirit of parity invoked by the russians,  nauert said, the united states has required the russian government to close its san francisco consulate and two annexes in washington, d.c. and new york by sept. 2. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. secretary of state rex tillerson informed russian foreign minister sergei lavrov of the closures in a phone call on thursday, a senior trump administration official said. the two men plan to meet on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly in september, the official said. lavrov expressed regret about washington s decision during the phone call with tillerson, his ministry said.  moscow will closely study the new measures announced by the americans, after which our reaction will be conveyed,  the russian foreign ministry said in a statement. the latest u.s. move caps eight months of back and forth retaliatory measures between the two countries spanning two u.s. administrations. in december, the administration of barack obama closed two russian countryside vacation retreats in maryland and new york, saying the compounds had been used for intelligence related purposes. the closures were part of a broader response, including the expulsion of 35 suspected russian spies, to what u.s. officials have called cyber interference by moscow in the 2016 elections. the kremlin has denied the allegations. trump came into office wanting to improve relations with russia, a desire that was hamstrung by the election interference allegations. the new sanctions passed by congress conflicted with trump s goals, but he grudgingly signed them into law this month. the united states said last week that it would have to sharply scale back visa services in russia, a move that will hit russian business travelers, tourists and students. the russian consulate in san francisco handles work from seven states in the western united states. there are three other russian consulates separate from the embassy in washington. they are in new york, seattle and houston. the consulate in san francisco is the oldest and most established of russia s consulates in the united states, the senior trump administration official told reporters. an official residence at the consulate will also be closed. no russian diplomats are being expelled, and the diplomats assigned to san francisco can be re assigned to other posts in the united states, the official said. the russians can continue to retain ownership of any of the closed facilities, or sell them, but will not be allowed to carry out diplomatic activities there, the official said.  even after these closures, russia will still maintain more diplomatic and consular annexes in the united states than we have in russia,  the official said.  we ve chosen to allow the russian government to maintain some of its annexes in an effort to arrest the downward spiral in our relationship.

" u.s. president donald trump will announce the approval of the keystone xl oil pipeline at the white house on friday, alongside the chief executive officer of builder transcanada corp, according to a senior administration official. the pipeline linking canadian oil sands to u.s. refiners had been blocked by former president barack obama, who said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for u.s. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. trump signed an executive order to advance the project soon after taking office in january, saying it would create thousands of jobs. the administration official said that among those scheduled to be at the white house for the 10:15 a.m. edt announcement are transcanada chief executive russell girling and sean mcgarvey, president of north america’s building trades unions. expedited approval of projects is part of trump’s approach for a 10 year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. the white house is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through the maze of regulatory requirements. “it does fit into the overall strategy the president has for infrastructure,” the official said. the multibillion dollar keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from canada’s oil sands in alberta into nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding u.s. refineries and ports along the gulf of mexico.  approvals are still needed from state regulators, and the pipeline could face legal challenges. conservatives have said they support quick approval. nick loris, an energy and environment researcher at the heritage foundation, said on thursday that approval would “re establish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.” environmental groups that have opposed the pipeline have said they will continue the fight with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.

" the republican governor of texas on tuesday called for a special state legislative session that could allow lawmakers to adopt a bill to restrict access to bathrooms for transgender people, viewed by critics as discriminatory and economically damaging. governor greg abbott, who sets the agenda for special sessions, told a news conference the session would begin in july and the first item of business would be approving a bill that keeps some state agencies open.  if approved by the senate, he then would allow for consideration of nearly 20 other items, including a bathroom bill. “at a minimum we need a law that protects the privacy of our children in our public schools,” abbott said. political and business analysts said passage of such a bill would put texas, the most powerful republican controlled state, in the spotlight on an issue that has been a flashpoint in u.s. culture wars.   the issue has opened divisions in the republican party, which dominates texas politics, pitting the pro business establishment wing against the powerful socially conservative wing, which says a bathroom law is a common sense measure needed to protect privacy. a similar law in north carolina, partially repealed in march, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.  the stakes are far higher in texas, which has an economy larger than russia’s. the texas legislature meets every other year. in march, the senate passed a bill backed by social conservative republican lieutenant governor dan patrick that would require people to use restrooms in public schools and buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, not the gender with which they identify. the texas association of business, the state’s largest employer group, called the legislation, known as senate bill 6, discriminatory, and said it would hurt businesses trying to attract talent. it said the state could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 if enacted.  sb 6 died in the house when the regular session ended in late may. republican speaker joe straus, seen as representing the party’s business wing, has said the legislation was unnecessary and could cause economic damage. if a tough bathroom bill is enacted, straus’ san antonio constituency could lose its rights to host the men’s ncaa final four basketball championship next year, an event expected to bring in more than $200 million in revenue.

" hong kong s leader denied on friday that china had taken over immigration controls in the city after a british activist was refused entry, but she couldn t rule out barring even the last colonial governor and frequent china critic, chris patten. chief executive carrie lam defended hong kong s autonomy amid deepening questions over the chinese ruled financial hub s reputation as a free and international city, after a conservative party rights activist, benedict rogers, was barred from entering on wednesday. when asked on a radio talk show whether patten, who has criticized perceived chinese interference in hong kong affairs, would be the next to be barred, lam stopped short of ruling it out.  i can t exclude any possibilities because immigration matters will change depending on the case,  she told public broadcaster rthk. patten, who spoke extensively during a recent hong kong visit and was critical of the jailing of several democracy activists, has angered some in the pro beijing establishment. britain handed hong kong back to chinese rule in 1997 amid promises that its widespread freedoms and autonomy would be respected under a  one country, two systems  formula. but china s foreign ministry said it had the right to allow or refuse any persons wanting to enter hong kong, in response to rogers  case, as this was a matter of state sovereignty. the promise of autonomy is enshrined in the mini constitution, known as the basic law, that creates a separate hong kong legal and policing regime, including immigration controls. but china has sovereign control over defense and foreign affairs   which critics fear beijing is exploiting to erode the city s freedoms.   i want to clarify any worries ... that this whole matter of immigration is now being taken over by the central people s government. that s certainly, definitely not the case,  lam said.  the case has to be regarded and treated and fall under what constitutes a foreign affairs matter.  patten did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment. china lodged a diplomatic complaint with london after british foreign secretary boris johnson demanded an urgent explanation from hong kong and china for rogers  expulsion.      the case has also sparked outcry from the city s pro democracy activists, including former number two official anson chan, who said beijing was using the case to send a message. local english newspaper the standard wrote in an editorial on friday that  if the situation is allowed to evolve into such a state that whoever disliked is barred, it could be the moment we begin to lose our international appeal .the u.s. consulate in hong kong also expressed concern.  we urge china to respect hong kong s high degree of autonomy consistent with the principle of  one country, two systems ,  u.s. consulate spokeswoman kristin haworth told reuters.  the chinese embassy in london, in an email reply to reuters late on thursday, did not respond directly to rogers  allegation that it had warned him through a middleman that he could be refused entry to hong kong.       it is a matter of chinese sovereignty whether or not to allow entry of any foreigners,  it said, echoing the foreign ministry.

" pakistan has ordered 27 international aid groups to shut down for working in unauthorized areas, spurring human rights campaigners to denounce swelling constraints on free speech and humanitarian work.  the ministry of interior gave the 27 ngos 90 days to conclude operations, according to a list seen by reuters. among those being expelled are action aid, world vision, plan international, trocaire, pathfinder international, danish refugee council, george soros  open society foundations, oxfam novib, and marie stopes.   talal chaudhry, pakistan s minister of state for interior affairs, told reuters the reason for shutting down the ngos was because they were doing work in pakistan  which is beyond their mandate and for which they have no legal justification .  he declined to give specific examples, but said the targeted ngos spend  all their money  on administration, are not doing the work they said they were doing, and are working in areas where they were not authorized. the pakistan humanitarian forum (phf), which represents 63 international aid groups, said the ministry had issued 11 of its members  letters of rejection . all of them said they will appeal. no reason for the rejections have been provided, the forum said. plan international, which has worked in pakistan since 1997, said it is supporting over 1.6 million children across pakistan. plan said it was given no reason for the ministry s decision and would appeal it.  the organization is hopeful that the appeals process will make it possible for its work with vulnerable and marginalized children, especially girls, to continue in pakistan,  it said in a statement.  all the other ngos on the list who responded to queries from reuters also said they had been given no reason for being forced to shut down.  they must be having reasons for every (ngo) and those reasons should have been shared with the organizations,  said a representative from one ngo who declined to be identified. chaudhry said the number of ngos in the country ballooned after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the united states. many organizations arrived to provide humanitarian assistance after islamabad allied itself with the united states in what was then known as the global war on terror.  but there were also a number of ngos that are used, knowingly or unknowingly for activities that conflict with pakistan s national interests,  chaudhry said, adding that registration procedures are commonplace in other countries. pakistan has hardened its stance towards domestic and international ngos in recent years, requiring them to undertake a painstaking registration process and clear multiple bureaucratic hurdles to continue working in the country. the save the children aid group fell afoul of the government in 2011, when it was linked to a pakistani doctor recruited by the cia to help in the hunt that led to the killing of al qaeda militant leader osama bin laden in the town of abbottabad. in january, the interior ministry ordered a dozen domestic groups working on women s issues and human rights to halt operations, a move later overturned in courts. pakistan is hardly alone in cracking down on foreign charities.  indian prime minister narendra modi s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non profit groups, saying they were acting against india s national interests. thousands of foreign funded charities  licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations. in china, a law that went into effect on jan. 1 this year grants broad powers to police to question ngo workers, monitor their finances, regulate their work and shut down offices. the clampdown on ngos has come after a number of activists disappeared this year, some of whom have not been heard from. reuters estimates at least 14 people have been picked up and interrogated from major urban centers including journalists, political workers, and social media activists. three members of the human rights commission of pakistan (hrcp) have also disappeared in the past year, chairperson mehdi hasan told reuters.  human rights campaigners say the crackdown on ngos and  disappearances of civil society activists are part of a wider campaign to quell free speech.   they both signify the shrinking space for free expression and activism in pakistan and the diminishing tolerance the pakistan state has,  saroop ijaz, a representative for the pakistan chapter of human rights watch, told reuters.  yusuf, who formerly served as hrcp chairperson, said pakistan feels it has impunity in dealing with rights groups and activists.    its the repositioning of pakistan as a security state and perceiving all forms of dissent as a security challenge,  yusuf said.   it s creating a lot of fear in society.

" maryland’s house of delegates on monday approved legislation to bar police statewide from checking the immigration status of individuals they arrest or keeping them locked up longer than otherwise warranted at the request of federal agents seeking to deport them. the state senate in annapolis, which like the lower house of the general assembly is controlled by democrats, has yet to consider the bill, and republican governor larry hogan issued a statement vowing to veto the measure if it reached his desk. “this legislation would interfere with our state and local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal law enforcement authorities,” hogan said. supporters say the measure, which cleared the house of delegates on a largely party line vote of 83 55, is designed in large part to maintain the trust of immigrant communities in local law enforcement and government agencies. it would prohibit state and local police officers from stopping, arresting, searching or detaining an individual for purposes of suspected immigration violations.  it would also bar police from honoring administrative “detainer” requests from federal immigration authorities seeking to keep jailed individuals in custody after they should otherwise be released on bond. other provisions would require the state attorney general to issue guidelines to public schools, courthouses and hospitals on limiting immigration enforcement in those places. and it would restrict state funds from being used to create a registry of people on the basis of immigration status, nationality, religion or ethnic origin. the measure follows in the footsteps of dozens of municipalities and local jurisdictions across the country that have declared themselves “sanctuary cities,” including san francisco, chicago, boston, los angeles, philadelphia, seattle and washington. so far no such statewide designations have been enacted. republican president donald trump in january signed an executive order seeking to withhold federal funds from local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  at the time, he said local jurisdictions put u.s. citizens at risk by releasing criminals who should be deported and who, in some cases, commit additional offenses after being released from jail.

" former u.s. vice president al gore said on friday that president donald trump’s rejection of the paris climate change agreement was fueling, rather than weakening, momentum among environmental activists. gore, whose follow up to his 2006 oscar winning documentary “an inconvenient truth” is showing in movie theaters worldwide this month, said governments and companies had stepped up since trump’s decision in june to withdraw from the 2015 global pact. “the entire world the next day re doubled their commitments to the paris agreement and in the u.s, the governors of our largest states and hundreds of mayors, thousands of business leaders all stood up to fill the gap and said ‘we are still in the paris agreement,’” gore told reuters television. “i do think that the reaction to donald trump is actually driving much more momentum in the climate movement,” he added. gore’s new documentary, “an inconvenient sequel: truth to power,” argues that fighting climate change is a moral battle, on a par with the civil rights movement in the united states or the fight for gay rights. shot mostly before trump’s election, it also shows the republican on the 2016 campaign trail promising to abolish environmental regulations and boost the coal and oil industries.  “an inconvenient truth” is credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the united states a decade ago. it won the best documentary oscar in 2007 and helped propel gore to a nobel peace prize, which he shared with the intergovernmental panel on climate change.

" u.s. treasury secretary steve mnuchin said on sunday that he would put together a package of new sanctions to potentially cut off all trade with north korea after pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. speaking on fox news, mnuchin said he would ask u.s. president donald trump to strongly consider cutting off all trade with new sanctions. “if countries want to do business with the united states, they obviously will be working with our allies and others to cut off north korea economically,” he said.

" the u.s. senate rejected an amendment on wednesday that would have forced the repeal of war resolutions used as the legal basis for u.s. military actions in iraq, afghanistan and against extremists in syria and other countries. the senate voted 61 to 36 to kill the measure, which six months after it became law would have put an end to authorizations for the use of military force (aumf) passed in 2001 and 2002.  the legislation was offered by republican senator rand paul as an amendment to a must pass annual defense policy bill, which lawmakers are using as a vehicle to gain a greater say in national security policy. paul’s measure was aimed at asserting the constitutional right of congress to approve military action, rather than the president. some of the other amendments address issues such as sanctions on north korea and president donald trump’s ban on transgender troops in the military. many members of congress are concerned the 2001 aumf, passed days after the sept. 11 attacks to authorize the fight against al qaeda and affiliates, has been used too broadly as the legal basis for a wide range of military action in too many countries. the majority of support for the amendment came from democrats, who joined paul in arguing that it is long past time for congress to debate a new authorization for the use of force. “we should oppose unauthorized, undeclared, unconstitutional war. at this particular time, there are no limits on war,” paul said. republicans control majorities in both the senate and house of representatives. only two other republicans backed the amendment. opponents said it would endanger u.s. forces already deployed in conflicts overseas by generating uncertainty about their mission. “repealing the 2001 and 2002 aumfs without simultaneously passing a new authorization would be premature, it would be irresponsible,” said republican senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee. however, mccain and several other senators who spoke against the amendment said they would back efforts to pass a new authorization through so called “regular order,” including hearings and debate. a growing number of lawmakers argue that using the 2001 authorization is especially questionable for the campaign against islamic state, which did not exist when it was passed, and fights against al qaeda in syria and elsewhere.

" north korea s ambassador to peru said tuesday that lima s decision to expel him was akin to  throwing gasoline on the fire  on the dispute over pyongyang s nuclear tests that it would continue to pursue  without wavering.  peru declared the ambassador, kim hak chol, a persona non grata on monday to protest north korea s refusal to heed the world s  constant calls  to end its nuclear program   giving him five days to leave the andean country.  the bilateral and diplomatic measure taken yesterday by the peruvian government lacks judicial and moral reasoning and doesn t further world peace and security at all,  kim said, reading from a statement at a news conference in lima.  to the contrary, it throws gasoline on the fire for which we express protest and regret,  kim added before declining to take questions from reporters. peru s decision to expel kim followed a similar move by mexico last week and a public call from the united states last month for latin american countries to sever ties with north korea. peruvian foreign minister ricardo luna said the move was strongly rooted in international law as reflected by new u.n. sanctions against north korea passed on monday.  it s inappropriate to maintain relations with that country,  luna said in broadcast comments to journalists.  though we haven t broken off ties, by expelling him the level of diplomats in charge of relations is lowered.  north korea has faced growing condemnation from around the world following its sixth and largest nuclear test this month which fueled fears it could spark war. u.s. president donald trump has described the boosted sanctions passed by the u.n. security council on monday as  nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.  kim condemned the sanctions as part of the hostility from the united states regarding north korea that he said has forced pyongyang to pursue nuclear tests as a dissuasive measure.  that s a problem between us and the united states,  kim said.  we ll continue without wavering on the path of justice that we ve chosen despite the slander and defamation from the united states because we re certain our cause is just and will triumph.  kim will leave peru as requested and two diplomats will remain in charge of the embassy, an embassy representative said. peru does not have any diplomats in north korea. pyongyang opened its embassy in peru in the 1980s during the first government of former president alan garcia, which bought weapons from north korea at a discount for police. trade between the two countries is minimal.

" the head of the u.s. senate armed services committee on wednesday increased pressure on the pentagon and the air force, demanding answers over the continued use of russian rocket engines for u.s. satellite launches. senator john mccain, in a letter dated feb. 10 seen by reuters, asked air force secretary deborah james and pentagon chief arms buyer frank kendall to explain why the u.s. government is continuing to deal with npo energomash, the russian firm that builds russian rd 180 rocket engines.  mccain pressed the officials on the legality of doing business with npo energomash given sanctions in place against russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin and others, who now have control over the company after a recent reorganization.      mccain also questioned the air force’s continued payment of a large launch support contract to united launch alliance (ula), a joint venture of lockheed martin corp and boeing co, despite the presence of a certified competitor, space exploration technologies, or spacex. mccain said he wants answers to these questions by february 22.  james pledged to respond to the questions during a january hearing, but mccain said he followed up in writing to underscore his concerns about what he has described as subsidies to russian leader “vladimir putin and his gang of corrupt cronies.” congress banned use of the russian rd 180 rocket engines for military use after russia annexed ukraine’s crimea region in 2014. but u.s. lawmakers weakened the ban late last year, worried that it could drive ula out of business and leave just privately held spacex, to lift satellites into space. james and other officials have urged congress to allow use of the russian engines that power ula’s atlas 5 rocket for several years until alternatives are available in several years.  in his letter, mccain asked the u.s. and air force to explain what options they had to penalize ula for not bidding in a recent launch competition despite receiving launch support of $800 million to $1 billion a year since 2006. he also asked the department to examine what percentage of that annual support contract was associated with ula’s other family of rockets, the delta 4, which the company plans to retire since it is more costly than the atlas 5. mccain and other senators argue that it would be worth the extra cost to end u.s. reliance on the russian engines.

" the u.s. department of defense will soon submit a plan to congress on how to defeat islamic state, a defense official said on thursday, four days before a deadline.  the national defense authorization act (ndaa), a defense policy bill president barack obama signed into law in november, required the administration to submit its strategy for defeating the militant group to lawmakers by feb. 15. republican congressional leaders said on thursday they had had no indication that the report was imminent despite the short time remaining before the deadline. “we are aware of the report and are actively working with multiple interagency offices to complete this legal requirement per the ndaa and look forward to submitting the completed report to congress in the near term,” the department of defense official said on condition of anonymity, in an emailed statement. paul ryan, the republican speaker of the house of representatives, issued a statement earlier thursday calling on obama, a democrat, to submit by monday a “real, comprehensive strategy” for defeating islamic state. the united states is leading a military campaign against the militant islamist group, which has seized swathes of territory in syria and iraq. republicans in congress have sharply criticized obama for failing to defeat islamic state, saying he mistakenly underestimated the threat it posed, allowing it to gain strength. u.s. defense secretary ash carter started talks in brussels on thursday with more than two dozen defense ministers, pressing allies to contribute to the effort.

" hillary clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as u.s. secretary of state, an internal government watchdog said on wednesday. the long awaited report by the state department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public. it was highly critical of clinton’s use of a server in her home, and immediately fueled republican attacks on clinton, the democratic front runner in an already acrimonious presidential race.  the report, which also found problems in department record keeping practices before clinton’s tenure, undermined clinton’s earlier defenses of her emails, likely adding to democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate. a majority of voters say clinton is dishonest, according to multiple polls.  the report concluded that clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. the report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet. several suspected hacking attempts in 2011 were never reported to department information security officials, in breach of department rules, it said. “she’s as crooked as they come,” donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential candidate, said of clinton at a campaign rally in anaheim, california, adding that the report’s findings were “not good” for her. clinton’s campaign disagreed, saying the report rebutted republican’s criticism. the inspector general’s office examined email record keeping under five secretaries state, both democratic and republican. john kerry, the current officeholder, and predecessors madeline albright, colin powell and condoleezza rice all agreed to speak to the inspector general’s investigators. clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed, as did her aides. the report contradicted clinton’s repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed.  several other inquiries continue, including a u.s. justice department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws. the inspector general’s report cited “longstanding, systemic weaknesses” with state department records that predated clinton’s tenure, and found problems with the email record keeping of some of her predecessors, particularly powell, that failed to comply with the federal records act.  but it singled out clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in chappaqua, new york, for government business. “oig found no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server,” the report said, using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general. the report said clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the department’s security and technology officials. officials told investigators that they “did not   and would not   approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct department business.” the reason, those officials said, is because it breached department rules and presented “security risks.” state department spokesman mark toner said he would not “challenge” those findings. he told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on clinton’s server, but had no evidence that any were successful.  when two lower level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about clinton’s email arrangement in late 2010, their supervisor in clinton’s office instructed them “never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again,” the report said. their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system, but the inspector general’s office said it found no evidence this was true. brian fallon, a clinton spokesman, said the report rebutted criticisms of clinton made by her political opponents. “the report shows that problems with the state department’s electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a state department email account until after the arrival of her successor,” he said in a statement. he did not address the report’s criticism of clinton’s use of a private server, something no other secretary of state has done. democrats, including fundraisers for clinton’s campaign, said the report revealed nothing new. “it’s digging and digging and digging,” amy rao, the chief executive of data company integrated archive systems and a clinton fundraiser, said in an interview, comparing the investigation to probes the clintons faced in the 1990s. “trust me: there’s no there there. it’s whitewater.” current secretary of state kerry asked steve linick, the state department inspector general, to investigate after clinton’s email arrangement came to light last year. president barack obama appointed linick to the role in 2013.  republicans have used clinton’s email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public access laws. republican national committee chairman reince priebus said in a statement that the findings “are just the latest chapter in the long saga of hillary clinton’s bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security.”  ",0
" former republican presidential candidate ted cruz returned to his job in the u.s. senate on tuesday with a warning to washington that the turbulent primary race was a wake up call. “all across this country people are hungry for change. this election cycle should be a wake up call to washington, d.c.,” the senator from texas said outside his office. “the frustration and volcanic anger with washington was echoed throughout this election.” presumptive republican nominee donald trump and democratic u.s. senator bernie sanders have upended expectations in their respective presidential campaigns, tapping into voter anger at establishment politicians in washington. cruz, a favorite of the conservative tea party movement, also tried to position himself as an outsider.  however, he dropped out of the republican race a week ago after a crushing loss in indiana and a brutal campaign in which trump attacked cruz’s wife and father and constantly derided the senator as “lyin’ ted.” cruz ruled out a third party candidacy, and said the democratic process had run its course. earlier on tuesday, cruz welcomed the idea of tossing his hat back into the ring in a lighthearted exchange with a staunch supporter, conservative radio host glenn beck.  beck, who campaigned heavily for cruz in the senator’s quest for the republican nomination, asked the 45 year old texan whether he would consider getting back into the race if he won nebraska’s primary on tuesday. “i am not holding my breath,” cruz said to laughter on beck’s show on theblaze radio network. “my assumption is that that will not happen. ... the reason we suspended the race last week is with indiana’s loss i didn’t see a viable path to victory.”  “if that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.” trump’s victory in indiana last tuesday pushed cruz and ohio governor john kasich out of the republican race and put the brakes on the “stop trump” movements sparked by his unorthodox candidacy.  trump campaign adviser sam clovis dismissed the possibility of cruz re entering the race as highly unlikely. “i think if ted has a future in republican politics in this country, i think he’ll want to preserve that,” clovis told cnn. cruz may be hoping to put his conservative imprint on the party’s july 18 21 national convention in cleveland. on monday, he said he would not release delegates he had won in kansas, oklahoma and texas, according to news reports.  trump needs 1,237 delegates, a majority of the delegates at the convention, to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, and it is not guaranteed he will win them in the remaining nominating contests. asked if he would endorse trump, cruz said every voter needs to make their own choice and they do not need to make it now. “the republican convention isn’t for another two and a half months; the election isn’t for another six months,” the senator said. “i think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do.” ",0

" russian president vladimir putin signed into law on saturday new measures allowing authorities to list foreign media outlets as  foreign agents  in response to what moscow says is unacceptable u.s. pressure on russian media. the new law has been rushed through both russian houses of parliament in the last two weeks. it will now allow moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources. a copy of the law was published on the russian government s online legislation database on saturday, saying it entered into force from the day of its publication. russia s move against u.s. media is part of the fallout from allegations that russia interfered in last year s u.s. presidential election in favor of donald trump. u.s. intelligence officials have accused the kremlin of using russian media organizations it finances to influence u.s. voters, and washington has since required russian state broadcaster rt to register a u.s. based affiliate company as a  foreign agent . the kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and said the restrictions on russian broadcasters in the united states are an attack on free speech.  the russian justice ministry last week published a list of nine u.s. backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes. it said it had written to the u.s. government sponsored voice of america (voa) and radio free europe/radio liberty (rfe/rl), along with seven separate russian or local language news outlets run by rfe/rl.

" democratic candidate hillary clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the electoral college and claim the u.s. presidency, according to the latest reuters/ipsos states of the nation project results released on saturday. in the last week, there has been little movement. clinton leads donald trump in most of the states that trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. according to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. the mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for clinton to 212 for trump. trump came off his best debate performance of the campaign wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed clinton winning the third and final face off on prime time tv. trump disputes those findings. and some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had clinton maintaining her solid lead. but the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for trump with 17 days to go until the nov. 8 election.  trump did gain ground in south carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss up. unfortunately for him, he lost ground in arizona, which is now too close to call. additionally, he is facing a challenge for utah’s six electoral college votes from former cia operative and utah native evan mcmullin. the independent candidate is siphoning votes away from trump in a state that is republican as any in the nation. in some polls, mcmullin is even leading. (the states of the nation is not polling on mcmullin.) utah, like almost all of the states, is a winner take all contest. clinton has also maintained a lead in florida and pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 electoral college votes. ohio remains too close to call. according to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits trump but his best hope for success is if republican turnout surges and democratic turnout is low. to examine these results and other scenarios, go to the states of the nation project here .

" the head of the u.n. nuclear watchdog said on monday iran was abiding by the rules set out in a nuclear accord it signed with six world powers in 2015, after washington suggested it was not adhering to the deal. the state department must notify congress every 90 days of iran s compliance with the deal. the next deadline is october and u.s. president donald trump has said he thinks by then the united states will declare iran non compliant. yukiya amano, the head of the international atomic energy agency (iaea), said iran had not broken any promises and was not receiving special treatment.  the nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under the (deal) are being implemented,  he said in the text of a speech to a quarterly meeting of the iaea s 35 member board of governors.  most sanctions on iran were lifted 18 months ago under the deal and, despite overstepping a limit on its stocks of one chemical, it has adhered to the key limitations imposed on it. in april, trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on iran related to the nuclear deal, negotiated under president barack obama, was in the u.s. national security interest. he has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated.  the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, nikki haley, traveled to vienna last month to speak with amano about iran and asked if the iaea planned to inspect iranian military sites, something she has called for. iran dismissed the u.s. demand as  merely a dream . amano declined to comment on haley s statements when asked by reporters. iran has been applying an additional protocol, which is in force in dozens of nations and gives the iaea access to sites, including military locations, to clarify questions or inconsistencies that may arise.  we will continue to implement the additional protocol in iran ... as we do in other countries,  amano said, referring to so called complementary access visits granted under the protocol, details of which amano said were confidential.  i cannot tell you how many complementary accesses we have had, but i can tell you ... that we have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs.  he called verification measures in iran  the most robust regime  currently in existence. in addition, the iaea can request access to iranian sites including military ones if it has concerns about activities or materials there that would violate the agreement, but it must show iran the basis for those concerns. that means new and credible information pointing to such a violation is required first, officials from the agency and major powers say. there is no indication that washington has presented such information.

" the united states will provide ukraine with  enhanced defensive capabilities,  the state department said on friday, as kiev battles russian backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.  u.s. assistance is entirely defensive in nature, and as we have always said, ukraine is a sovereign country and has a right to defend itself,  the department said in a statement. it said the decision was part of the u.s. effort to help ukraine defend its territorial integrity and  deter further aggression,  but did not specify the capabilities being considered. earlier on friday, abc news reported that president donald trump was expected to approve the sale of anti tank missiles to ukraine, citing state department sources. any sale would need congressional approval. ukraine and russia are at loggerheads over a war in eastern ukraine between pro russian separatists and ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which russia denies. russian president vladimir putin said in september that any decision by the united states to supply defensive weapons to ukraine would fuel the conflict in eastern ukraine and possibly prompt the separatists to expand their campaign there. on monday, the russian foreign ministry said it was recalling officers serving at the joint centre for control and coordination (jccc) in ukraine, accusing the ukrainian side of obstructing their work and limiting access to the front line. ukrainian officials, security monitors and kiev s foreign backers warned on wednesday that moscow s decision to withdraw from a ukrainian russian ceasefire control group could worsen the fighting in eastern ukraine. earlier this week the state department said it had approved an export license for ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from u.s. manufacturers. senator john mccain on wednesday welcomed the small arms sale. mccain, a republican, urged trump  to authorize additional sales of defensive lethal weapons, including anti tank munitions, and to fully utilize security assistance funds provided by the congress to enable ukraine to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

" hondurans spilled into the streets of the capital on monday night, banging pots and pans and joining rebel police in defiance of a curfew imposed after a presidential election that was heavily criticized by the organization of american states. some police officers abandoned their posts and joined carnival like demonstrations that erupted across the city hours after night fell and the curfew was supposed to have begun.   a statement issued in the name of the national police said the officers were upset with the government over a political crisis that was not their responsibility.  our people are sovereign,  said a member of the elite cobra riot police, reading the statement.  we cannot confront and repress their rights.  authorities finished counting votes on monday after a week of increasingly widespread criticism about the nov. 26 election, with organization of american states (oas) lending credence to opposition claims the government manipulated the results to ensure a win.   the tight margin, along with the irregularities, errors and systematic problems that have surrounded this election, does not allow the mission to be certain about the results,  said former bolivian president jorge quiroga, heading the oas election observation mission in the central american country. electoral authorities said president juan orlando hernandez won 42.98 percent of the vote, compared with opposition challenger salvador nasralla s 41.39 percent, based on 99.96 percent of ballot boxes tallied. however, authorities refrained from declaring a winner, with nasralla s center left opposition alliance demanding a wide recount of nearly a third of votes, a request backed by the oas and european union election observers.  lending more support to that view, a leader of rebellious cobra riot police told reporters the country wanted a vote by vote recount to clarify the results, and called on the armed forces to come out in support of the police protest.  the alliance, which claims that results sheets from ballot boxes were altered, is expected to formally contest the results.  president hernandez, who has been praised by the united states for his crackdown on street gangs, also refrained from calling himself the winner on monday, despite claiming victory several times since the election.    i make a call for peace, for brotherhood, for sanity, for national unity,  he told reporters. in a striking sign of support for hernandez, 49, the u.s. state department cleared the way for honduras to receive millions of dollars in u.s. aid two days after the election, certifying that the government has been fighting corruption and upholding human rights, a document seen by reuters showed. the government was struggling to contain the fallout from the chaos on monday evening.  even former tv star nasralla joined a crowd of boisterous supporters, jumping up and down in a tan suit while flashing peace signs and joining a chant of  the dictatorship will fall,  a video posted on twitter showed.  the additional powers granted to the army and police including the nighttime curfew from friday were intended to stem the protests and have led to more than a thousand arrests. up to 12 people have been killed in the protests or during the curfew. tens of thousands peacefully took to the streets on sunday in a show of force for the opposition. the police revolt began when more than 200 members of the cobras refused to carry on battling protesters, saying it was tantamount to taking sides. nasralla has repeatedly called on the security forces to ignore orders.  we are rebelling,  said one of the policemen, who covered his face in a ski mask and declined to give his name.  we call on all the police nationally to act with their conscience.  they soon had the support of other units, with reports that their protests had spread to other cities.  the police also said they were angry about the death of two colleagues shot while they were enforcing the curfew on sunday night, an attack a spokesman said was unrelated to the election protests. two civilian protesters were killed in the capital overnight, their relatives said, although authorities did not confirm the deaths. the oas called for peaceful protests, said politicians must not incite violence and that security forces must respect human rights. last week, at least three people were killed as soldiers broke up protesters  blockades. one police source and local reports said five more had been shot dead in the north of the country on friday. the deaths have not been confirmed by authorities.  early last week, nasralla, a 64 year old former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory, gaining a five point lead with more than half of the ballots tallied. the counting process suddenly halted for more than a day and began leaning in favor of hernandez after resuming.  opposition leaders on monday showed a sample of their own records

" a seoul court on friday found lotte group chairman shin dong bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years, leaving him free to try and revive the conglomerate after steep losses in china. the seoul central district court cleared the executive of some counts of breach of trust and one embezzlement charge.  i apologize to the public,  shin said as he left court, without commenting further. prosecutors had sought a ten year jail term for shin on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust after a probe since 2016 into the retail to chemicals group.       the ruling will come as a relief to lotte at the end of a tough year during which it became the highest profile corporate victim of a beijing seoul spat over south korea s installation of a u.s. missile defense system.  south korea s fifth largest conglomerate said,  we respect the court s decision. lotte group executives and employees will further unite to contribute to economic progress and do our best to meet our social responsibility.   the prosecution did not have an immediate comment. legal experts said the prosecution was likely to appeal. shin is the subject of another ongoing trial related to a bribery scandal involving former president park geun hye. prosecutors are seeking a four year jail term and a fine of 7 billion won ($6.49 million). in the meantime, friday s ruling means lotte, with 110.8 trillion won worth of assets, avoids a leadership vacuum for the time being as it navigates mounting china losses and an uncertain recovery. shunned in china, its key market, after it was pressed by seoul to provide land for the thaad missile defense system, lotte s third quarter china hypermarket sales were nearly wiped out to about $278,000 from around $264 million a year earlier.  nearly all lotte mart stores in china have been shut for much of the year with local authorities citing fire safety issues, and the group has now put the business up for sale.  but the sale is likely to be delayed past the end 2017 deadline lotte had sought, lotte corp official choi min ho said, without giving a reason.  lotte s businesses in south korea, including its major duty free operations, that had counted on big spending chinese tourists, remain under pressure amid curbs on chinese tour groups traveling to the country. south korea s credit rating agencies have downgraded or cut their outlook for corporate bonds of the group s flagship retailer lotte shopping and hotel lotte [htlot.ul], citing hurdles in improving their financial stability. lotte, which shelved plans for an estimated $4.5 billion ipo of hotel lotte amid the investigation, is now battening down the hatches as a difficult year draws to an end. lotte shopping has frozen wages for its department store business this year for the first time since 2009, three lotte officials said this week, declining to be identified as the matter was sensitive.  while lotte confirmed wages had been frozen, the retail to chemical conglomerate declined further comment.  however, one of the officials from the department store business said:  wages have been frozen due to various factors, but the thaad issue was one of them.

" syrian warplanes took off from an air base which was hit by u.s. cruise missiles on friday, and carried out air strikes on rebel held areas in the eastern homs countryside, the syrian observatory for human rights said. the u.s. navy had fired dozens of missiles at the air base near homs city in response to a chemical attack this week which washington and its allies blamed on the damascus government. the british based observatory, a group monitoring the syrian war using sources on the ground, said eight people had been killed in the u.s. attack. the extent of the damage to the shayrat air base was not entirely clear, but the syrian warplanes had “done the impossible” in order to continue using it for sorties, the observatory told reuters.

" the illinois senate on thursday earmarked $227.2 million for low income college students whose need based financial aid has been imperiled by the state’s 11 month budget impasse. but republican governor bruce rauner offered no sign of supporting the measure for monetary award program recipients after members of his party pilloried the funding package as a “farce” because it did not identify a specific revenue stream to pay for it. rauner spokeswoman catherine kelley declined to say whether the governor intends to sign or veto the legislation, saying only “governor rauner remains committed to reaching a balanced budget alongside meaningful reforms in a bipartisan manner.” illinois’ public universities and community colleges and the map program have only received a fraction of what they had expected from the state since july because rauner and the democratic led legislature have yet to agree on a fiscal 2016 spending plan. a stopgap $600 million higher education funding package enacted by rauner last month offered some relief, but an early may effort to appropriate an additional $454 million on top of the april total stalled in the illinois house of representatives after passing the senate. in fiscal 2015, the last year in which illinois had a full operating budget, the state appropriated $357.1 million to the map program. that amount provided for income based grants of up to $4,968 to 128,399 students, the illinois student assistance commission reported.   state senator donne trotter, a chicago democrat and the legislation’s chief sponsor, said the package would “ensure that our students can relieve themselves of some of the drama they’ve been going through this year because of the inaction by this body and the governor” in passing a budget. but republicans ripped the plan, with senator chapin rose, a republican from mahomet, ill., about 200 miles south of chicago, accusing the senate majority of “writing a check that it darn well knows cannot be cashed.” the senate passed the bill 39 15, with two members voting present   enough to override any potential rauner veto. but the 68 45 margin during a tuesday house vote fell three votes short of a veto proof majority, meaning rauner could kill the measure if he chose to.

" president donald trump on wednesday urged senate republicans to “go nuclear” and impose a rule change to force a simple majority vote on confirmation if democrats block his u.s. supreme court nominee, neil gorsuch, as democrats maneuvered for a hard fight. gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from colorado seen as a conservative intellectual, began holding private meetings with senators, starting with top senate republican mitch mcconnell, to drum up support for his nomination a day after trump picked  the 49 year old for a lifetime job on the country’s top court. trump’s fellow republicans control the senate 52 48. democrats signaled on wednesday they would set up a procedural hurdle, known as a filibuster, requiring 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation of gorsuch. the president urged mcconnell to change long standing senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for supreme court nominees, a move dubbed the “nuclear option,” if democrats block gorsuch. “we want to have him (gorsuch) go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process, because they’re very demeaning on the other side, and they want to make you look as bad as possible,” trump said, referring to democrats. “if we end up with that gridlock, i would say: ‘if you can, mitch, go nuclear,’” trump said at a white house meeting with conservative advocacy groups. supreme court nominations require senate confirmation.  if confirmed, gorsuch would reinstate the supreme court’s conservative majority, in place for decades until justice antonin scalia’s death last feb. 13. the court’s ideological shift could prove pivotal on a range of issues including presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty and transgender, gun and religious rights. trump’s comments came as democrats plotted strategy on how to deal with gorsuch’s nomination. they remain furious over mcconnell’s refusal last year to let the senate hold confirmation hearings or a vote on democratic president barack obama’s nomination of merrick garland to succeed scalia on the court.  some democratic senators, arguing that republicans stole a supreme court seat from obama, announced their opposition to gorsuch, while others said they were willing to hear him out. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor that if gorsuch could not meet the same standard republicans insisted on for obama’s supreme court nominees, at least 60 votes for confirmation, “then the problem lies not with the senate, but with the nominee.” “the answer should not be to change the rules of the senate, but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. sixty votes produces a mainstream candidate,” schumer added. to get those 60 votes, republicans hope to lure eight democrats up for re election in 2018 in republican leaning states or states that voted for trump last november. those include democrats from indiana, north dakota, west virginia, missouri, michigan, montana and wisconsin as well as closely divided maine. senator sherrod brown, a democrat from republican leaning ohio, already announced he would vote against gorsuch. senator tammy baldwin of wisconsin said she would review gorsuch’s record but was “deeply troubled” over his stances against disabled students, workers and women’s reproductive healthcare. senator jon tester of montana said in an interview he wanted to review gorscuch’s record on women’s rights and other issues, adding the judge’s stance on end of life issues “distresses me.” gorsuch is known for siding with the christian owners of a company that challenged federal requirements that businesses provide insurance coverage for women’s birth control and for writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide. the influential, deep pocketed americans for prosperity is promising a vigorous effort to help gorsuch get confirmed and is using its network of wealthy contributors to build support, especially in battleground states. the organization is led by multi billionaire brothers charles and david koch. it has been ramping up its political campaign donations in support of republican candidates for the senate and other offices.     schumer said that while trump campaigned as someone who would “be for the working man and woman,” he now had chosen a supreme court nominee who “sides with ceos over citizens.” “unfortunately, judge gorsuch has proven to have a judicial philosophy outside of the mainstream and time and again has subjugated individual rights to those of corporations,” said democratic senator kirsten gillibrand of new york, who came out in opposition to the nomination.  senator joe manchin, a moderate democrat who met with the nominee on wednesday, said a supreme court nominee should have to win the support of 60 senators but urged fellow democrats to give gorsuch a chance. manchin, whose home state, west virginia, voted overwhelmingly for trump, is up for re election in 2018. senate aides said republicans were hoping the judiciary committee could hold hearings and a vote on the nomination by late march, paving the way for confirmation by the full senate in the first week of april. if that happens, gorsuch could be on the high court in time to year a major transgender rights case.

"philadelphia s archbishop charles caput is accused of using mafia-like tactics against a state lawmaker who stands in support of child victims of sexual abuse.in an email to pennsylvania state representative jamie santora, the archbishop accused the elected official of  betraying the church.  the email went on to say that santora would suffer  consequences  for supporting legislation designed to provide victims of child sexual abuse with the justice they deserve.the bill which provoked the vicious message from caput would extend the amount of time that child sexual assault victims have to bring claims against their abusers.under the state s current law a victim of sexual assault only has until his or her 30th birthday to file a claim against the abuser. the legislation, which passed the state s lower house in april, would extend the deadline until the victim s 50th birthday.according to the intellectualist, caput is heading up a lobbying effort against the bill.the email provoked the wrath of state lawmakers on both sides of political aisle.republican state legislator mike vereb, who is also a catholic, accused the archbishop of using  mafia-like tactics  against lawmakers, saying: this mob boss approach of having legislators called out, he really went right up to the line. he is going down a road that is frankly dangerous for the status of the church in terms of it being a non-profit. the catholic church has no business engaging in any type of lobbying activity. in order to maintain its tax-exempt status, a church is strictly prohibited from engaging in political activity.the letter that caput sent out is a prime example of the kind of religious bullying the establishment clause was put in place to prevent.given the catholic church s history of child sexual abuse, caput s email accusing santora of  betraying the church  would indicate that the church is aware that many more victims exist.it seems clear that the church would prefer those victims never receive the justice they deserve.image credit via michal on flickr",1
" when johnathan smith resigned from the u.s. justice department on inauguration day, he looked forward to spending time with his infant son, but that plan unraveled a week later when president donald trump unveiled his explosive foreign travel ban. within two weeks, smith had a new job as legal director of civil rights group muslim advocates and was drafting briefs for a successful court challenge to the ban, joining other former top obama administration lawyers now fighting trump. it is not surprising that smith and some of his colleagues, political appointees of democratic president barack obama, would leave the justice department now led by republicans. what is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be trump adversaries. some republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post election. george terwilliger, a senior justice department official under president george h.w. bush, described the obama lawyers’ actions as “unprecedented to my memory – and really bad form.” one reason for the obama lawyers’ quick moves, some of them said, was trump’s aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges. obama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for president george w. bush, over issues such as immigration and obamacare. but those came later in obama’s presidency.  besides smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former attorney general eric holder, who is advising california’s legislature on challenging trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general neal katyal, who is helping hawaii contest trump’s revised travel ban. influential manhattan prosecutor preet bharara and another 45 obama era u.s. attorneys are out of jobs after the trump administration asked them to resign on friday. many of the obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some republicans, that obama is behind resistance efforts. some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to trump’s hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests. “there’s a unique threat to our democracy and constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the muslim community,” said smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the justice department. norman eisen, who was obama’s top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the czech republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after trump’s election. but instead, he said, “the ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial obama role.”  eisen is now also chairing citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a watchdog group he co founded. the group has already sued trump over alleged ethics violations. other obama appointees taking on trump include former white house lawyer ian bassin who has founded united to protect democracy, a new group probing trump over ethics; and james cadogan, who worked with smith at the justice department, and is now at the naacp legal defense and education fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration. some career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose trump. one is sharon mcgowan, who worked on lgbt issues at the justice department. on inauguration day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at lambda legal, an lgbt advocacy group. mcgowan said she decided to leave justice when trump named jeff sessions, a hardline conservative alabama senator, to be attorney general. that was a “game changer,” she said. “i knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what i’ve been working on so hard.” ",0
" the united nations called on monday for a humanitarian pause in the yemeni capital of sanaa on tuesday to allow civilians to leave their homes, aid workers to reach them, and the wounded to get medical care. jamie mcgoldrick, u.n. humanitarian coordinator in yemen, said in a statement that the streets of sanaa had become  battlegrounds  and that aid workers  remain in lockdown .  thus, i call on all parties to the conflict to urgently enable a humanitarian pause on tuesday 5 december, between 10:00 a.m. and 16:00 p.m. to allow civilians to leave their homes and seek assistance and protection and to facilitate the movement of aid workers to ensure the continuity of life saving programs,  he said.  mcgoldrick warned the warring parties that any deliberate attacks against civilians, and against civilian and medical infrastructure, are  clear violations of international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes .

" chicago mayor rahm emanuel proposed a fiscal 2018 budget on wednesday that he said eschews “fiscal smoke and mirrors,” but critics said vestiges of those practices remain. in his annual budget speech to the city council, emanuel said the spending plan is free of what he called any “budget gimmick” like so called scoop and toss, which extends maturities on existing bonds to provide budget relief, for the first time since he took office. “every single bad financial practice we inherited in 2011 has now been eliminated from the budget,” he said. the $10 billion budget, which includes $3.77 billion for operations, relies on $94 million in savings from a future bond refinancing under a new debt structure.  a chronic structural budget deficit and an unfunded pension liability that totaled $35.76 billion at the end of 2016 have led to low credit ratings and increased borrowing costs for the nation’s third largest city. the mayor’s budget accelerates savings from a plan approved by the city council this month to refinance up to $3 billion of sales tax revenue and general obligation bonds through a new entity at lower interest rates. the new sales tax securitization corp will be assigned chicago’s state collected sales tax revenue and will pledge that money to pay off the refinanced bonds. bond investors will have a statutory lien shielding the debt from municipal bankruptcy, which is not allowed under illinois law. carole brown, chicago’s chief financial officer, said the city will realize more savings from the debt refinancing in fiscal 2018, which begins on jan. 1, than in 2019. “but we’ll expect to show savings annually until we’ve amortized all the debt,” she added. one critic, alderman john arena, said the new debt structure   which he opposed   could end up extending the life of some bonds by as much as 40 years.  “our fear is that (emanuel is) making the claim of moving scoop and toss out of the way we do business but really moving it over to that special entity,” he said.   brown acknowledged that to achieve level debt service on the corporation’s bonds, maturities on existing bonds may change.  “it is possible we won’t 100 percent match maturity for maturity,” she said. the budget counts on $50.3 million in revenue growth, $19.35 million in spending cuts, as well as other measures to address a $114.2 million structural gap and more than $87 million in new spending for additional police hires and reforms.

" a foreign policy adviser to u.s. presidential candidate donald trump confirmed his attendance at a meeting last month during which the republican party agreed to watered down language in its support of ukraine. j. d. gordon, the adviser who previously served as a pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the republican national convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the ukraine platform. but one delegate in attendance, diana denman, said gordon told her he was going to speak with trump during the debate over the platform’s language on ukraine, saying she believed trump’s campaign played a direct role in softening the party’s support for ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with russia. the trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the party’s position regarding ukraine. gordon called denman’s version of events “inaccurate.”  stephen yates, co chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that trump campaign members were present at the meeting where ukraine language for the rnc platform was discussed. but he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the trump campaign played any role in softening the ukraine language. the details of the meeting in cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the trump campaign’s stance toward russia. trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with russian president vladimir putin, praising him as a stronger leader than u.s. president barack obama. in the last month, trump has also suggested he might not defend nato allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite russia to hack the emails of democratic opponent hillary clinton and suggested he might accept russia’s 2014 annexation of crimea from ukraine. denman, a member of the platform committee’s national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported “providing lethal defensive weapons to ukraine’s armed forces and greater coordination with nato on defense planning.” that phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to “lethal defensive weapons.” in the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the party’s priorities, criticizes the obama administration for encouraging a “resurgent russia” and supports continued sanctions on moscow and “appropriate assistance to the armed forces of the ukraine” without specifying what that would involve. yates said denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong armed in subcommittee. “i don’t have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about,” he said. denman said she stands by her account. russia on thursday announced it would conduct war games in the black sea, a day after putin accused ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over crimea.

" democrats claimed historic gains in virginia’s statehouse and booted republicans from state and local office across the united states on tuesday, in the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump’s won the white house a year ago. democrats must figure out how to turn that momentum to their  advantage in november 2018 elections, when control of the u.s. congress and scores of statehouses will be at stake. from coast to coast, democratic victories showed grassroots resistance to trump rallying the party’s base, while independent and conservative voters appeared frustrated with the unpopular republican leadership in washington.  democrats won this year’s races for governor in virginia and new jersey, but successes in legislative and local races nationwide may have revealed more about where the party stands a year into trump’s administration. unexpectedly massive democratic gains in virginia’s statehouse surprised even the most optimistic party loyalists in a state that has trended democratic in recent years but remains a top target for both parties in national elections.  “this is beyond our wildest expectations, to be honest,” said catherine vaughan, co founder of flippable, one of several new startup progressive groups rebuilding the party at the grassroots level. with several races still too close to call, democrats were close to flipping, or splitting, control of the virginia house of delegates, erasing overnight a two to one republican majority. democratic lieutenant governor ralph northam also defeated republican ed gillespie by nearly nine percentage points in what had seemed a closer contest for virginia’s governor’s mansion, a year after democrat hillary clinton carried the state by five points in the presidential election. the losing candidate had employed trump style campaign tactics that highlighted divisive issues such as immigration, although the president did not join him on the campaign trail. in new jersey, a democratic presidential stronghold, voters replaced a two term republican governor with a democrat and increased the party’s majorities in the state legislature. democrats notched additional wins in a washington state senate race that gave the party full control of the state government and in republican controlled georgia, where democrats picked up three seats in special state legislative elections. “this was the first chance that the voters got to send a message to donald trump and they took advantage of it,” john feehery, a republican strategist in washington, said by phone. the gains suggested to some election analysts that democrats could retake the u.s. house of representatives next year. republicans control both the house and senate along with the white house. dave wasserman, who analyzes u.s. house and statehouse races for the nonpartisan cook political report, called the virginia results a “tidal wave.” even after tuesday’s gains, however, democrats are completely locked out of power in 26 state governments. republicans control two thirds of u.s. legislative chambers. desperate to rebuild, national democrats this year showed newfound interest in legislative contests and races even farther down the ballot. the democratic national committee successfully invested in mayoral races from st. petersburg, florida, to manchester, new hampshire. “if there is a lesson to be taken from yesterday, it is that we need to make sure that we are competing everywhere, because democrats can win,” dnc chairman tom perez said on a media call. democratic legislative campaign committee executive director jessica post said national party leaders must remain focused on local races, even in a congressional year. “we don’t focus enough on the state level, and that is why we are in the place we are,” she said. “but when we do, we win.” ",0
" philippine troops were locked in an intense urban firefight on sunday with the last remnants of a pro islamic state alliance, as the army sought to declare an end to the country s biggest internal security crisis in years. an estimated 30 people, including militants and some of their family members, were battling to hold a fortified, two storey building next to marawi city s vast lake lanao, and appeared ready to fight to the death, according to the deputy commander of the operation.  there s just one building and they re inside,  colonel romeo brawner told a news conference.  we believe these are ones who decided to fight it out, because they believe that if they die there they will go to heaven.  brawner said soldiers were using loudspeakers to urge them to surrender, and anticipated the gunfight could go on until midnight. they did not know how many people in the building were alive or dead, he said. the siege of marawi has stunned the philippines and stoked wider concerns that islamic state loyalists have learned how to thrive in impoverished muslim areas of the island of mindanao and use its jungles and mountains as staging posts to launch attacks. those fears are compounded by the marawi rebels  ability to recruit young fighters, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure five months of ground offensive and government air strikes that have devastated the city. the military made a significant gain with last week s killing of isnilon hapilon, islamic state s  emir  in southeast asia and omarkhayam maute, a leader of the maute militant group. another leader and possible bankroller of the operation, malaysian mahmud ahmad, was likely killed also, the military said. brawner said the authorities believed foreign operatives were among those still fighting and it was clear there was now a leadership vacuum.  at this point we don t know who is really the leader,  he added.  our government forces will try to do everything to finish the firefight today.  troops have started a phased withdrawal and the authorities may soon allow some residents to return to homes not damaged by the fighting, which displaced at least 300,000 people. more than 1,000 have been killed, mostly militants. the government estimates the rebuilding of marawi could cost at least 50 billion pesos ($971 million).

" saad al hariri, who resigned as lebanon s prime minister this month while in saudi arabia, said on saturday he would clarify his position when he returns to beirut next week.  hariri s resignation on nov. 4 threw lebanon into political crisis and put it center stage in the middle east s overarching rivalry between sunni saudi arabia and its allies and a bloc led by shi ite iran.  with regard to the political situation in lebanon, i will go to beirut in the coming days, i will participate in the independence celebrations, and it is there that i will make known my position on these subjects after meeting president (michel) aoun,  hariri said after holding talks with french president emmanuel macron in paris. hariri declined to take questions, but is set to return to beirut by wednesday when lebanon celebrates its independence day. he thanked macron, who has been mediating as part of french efforts to try to ease tensions across the region, for his help.  macron had leveraged france s close relations with both lebanon and saudi arabia to secure a deal that saw hariri travel to paris and open the door to a resolution of the crisis. hariri, who arrived at his residence in paris in the early hours of the morning, told aoun in a phone call from paris that he would be in lebanon on wednesday for the celebrations, the lebanese president said on twitter.  lebanon is being shaken so it s important hariri comes to paris for us to work with him on the best way out of the crisis,  said a senior french diplomat.  we re trying to create the conditions for a de escalation in the region. we want to avoid a proliferation of crises that could get out of control.  hariri s abrupt resignation and continued stay in saudi arabia has caused fears for lebanon s stability.  okab saqr, a member of parliament for hariri s future movement, said after hariri s visit to france he would have  a small arab tour  before traveling to beirut. a french presidential source said macron had reiterated that paris wanted hariri to return to lebanon to ensure the country s political system continued to function and that it was imperative it remained  disassociated  from regional crises.  the source said macron would continue to be active on the dossier in the coming days and that france was considering whether to host a meeting of the international lebanon support group to discuss the political crisis. the crisis has thrust lebanon into the regional rivalry pitting saudi arabia and its allies against a bloc led by iran, which includes the heavily armed lebanese shi ite hezbollah group. aoun has called hariri a saudi hostage and refused to accept his resignation unless he returns to lebanon. saudi arabia and hariri say his movements are not restricted. lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance after sunnis, shi ites, christians and druze fought a civil war between 1975 and 1990, with factions often backed by regional rivals. hariri, a sunni muslim, is a long time ally of saudi arabia. aoun, a christian, is a political ally of hezbollah. hariri s government, a power sharing coalition formed last year, includes hezbollah. france, which controlled lebanon between the world wars, has sought to play a key role in defusing tension with macron personally getting involved and putting him at the heart of a regional power struggle that will test his diplomatic skills.   that was evident since the outbreak of the lebanese crisis over the last week with a surprise visit to saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman in riyadh, followed by a flurry of calls, sending his foreign minister to saudi arabia and then the invitation to hariri, which caught many diplomats unawares.  while undoubtedly a diplomatic coup for macron, some regional and french diplomats have cautioned that his strategy to try to appease all sides in the region may backfire. on saturday, u.s. president donald trump spoke with macron about the situation in lebanon and syria. the white house said the leaders agreed on the need to work with allies to counter hezbollah s and iran s destabilizing activities in the region. paris has intensified its rhetoric over iran s regional activities. on thursday, foreign minister jean yves le drian, speaking alongside his saudi counterpart, denounced tehran s  hegemonic temptations . iran responded by accusing france of taking sides and macron on friday said iran should clarify its ballistic missile program. that was met by a rebuke in tehran. on saturday, ali akbar velayati, a senior adviser to iran s supreme leader, said macron should stay out of its affairs.

" the north korean nuclear issue needs a peaceful resolution, chinese president xi jinping told u.s. president donald trump in a telephone call on saturday, and called on the “relevant side” to exercise restraint, state television said. trump issued a new threat to north korea on friday, saying the u.s. military was “locked and loaded”, as pyongyang accused him of driving the korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war and world powers expressed alarm. xi told trump that it was in the joint interests of both china and the united states to achieve the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula and protect peace and stability there, state television said in a brief report. “the relevant side must at present exercise restraint, and avoid words and actions that exacerbate tensions on the korean peninsula,” the report paraphrased xi as saying. resolving the nuclear issue ultimately needs to be done politically via talks, and china is willing to maintain communication with the united states on the basis of mutual respect to push for an appropriate resolution, xi added. chinese state television cited trump as telling xi that he fully understands the role china has been playing on the north korean nuclear issue.

" republican presidential hopeful ted cruz lashed out at rival candidate donald trump on the day of indiana’s primary on tuesday, calling him a pathological liar, narcissist and bully after the front runner linked cruz’s father to john f. kennedy’s assassin. “i’m going to tell you what i really think of donald trump. this man is a pathological liar. he doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” cruz told reporters in a scathing indictment. “he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. and...his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.” in a television appearance earlier, trump linked cruz’s father, rafael cruz, to kennedy assassin lee harvey oswald, citing a report by national enquirer, a supermarket tabloid known for celebrity gossip and alien sightings. “you know, his father was with lee harvey oswald prior to oswald’s being — you know, shot. i mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. what is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody brings it up,” trump said on “fox & friends.”  republicans in indiana might give new york billionaire trump an almost unstoppable advantage in his turbulent journey toward the party’s presidential nomination.  the real estate mogul holds a double digit polling lead in the midwestern state over cruz, a u.s. senator of texas.    cruz denounced the enquirer and its chief executive, david pecker, who has endorsed trump, for claiming his father, a cuban immigrant to the united states, was pictured handing out pro fidel castro literature with oswald in new orleans in 1963. “yes, my dad killed jfk, he is secretly elvis and jimmy hoffa is buried in his back yard,” cruz said in a sarcastic retort. cruz also unleashed fury over trump’s earlier comment about his wife, heidi. “donald has a real problem with women. donald is terrified by strong women   he lashes out at them,” cruz said.  “the man is utterly amoral. morality does not exist for him,” cruz said.

" the u.s. house of representatives voted nearly unanimously on tuesday to reaffirm the nato alliance’s guarantee that all members defend each other, weeks after president donald trump raised doubts about washington’s support for the agreement. the vote was 423 4 in the house, where trump’s fellow republicans hold a 48 seat majority, for a resolution “solemnly reaffirming” the u.s. commitment to article 5 of the north atlantic treaty. it also supports calls for every nato member to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense by 2024.  during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels in may that was part of his first overseas trip, trump pointedly did not mention u.s. support for that critical portion of the nato charter, rattling allies. instead, he used a speech there to demand that member states pay more for the alliance’s defense. trump later said he backed the mutual defense agreement, and other senior officials rushed to express u.s. support. “with all the threats we and our partners face around the globe, a strong and secure nato is more important than ever before,” republican house speaker paul ryan said in a statement. the resolution was co sponsored by ryan and house democratic leader nancy pelosi, as well as the number two republican and democrat in the chamber, and the republican chairman and the ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee.

" u.s. president elect donald trump has left the agriculture secretary as the last department head to be named to his cabinet, while a meeting with the chief executives of two agribusiness giants gave a hint at a roster of farm issues the incoming president will face.     trump met on wednesday with the leaders of monsanto co (mon.n) and bayer ag (baygn.de), who pitched the benefits of their proposed $66 billion merger. while critical of other large tie ups, trump has not publicly taken a stance on the bayer monsanto deal. the secretary of the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) will not approve or reject the merger but will face the issue of industry consolidation. dow chemical co dow.n has proposed to merge with dupont dd.n, and china national chemical corp (chemchina) [cnncc.ul] is seeking to acquire syngenta ag synn.s.      trade, environmental regulation and the 2018 federal farm bill are also expected to be at the top of the farm agenda once trump takes office jan. 20, according members of an agricultural advisory committee he formed during the campaign.     how trump responds on those issues   and who he picks to lead the usda   could determine whether he is able to maintain the strong rural support he demonstrated in the nov. 8 election. some committee members told reuters they have had meetings with trump and his advisers, and have suggested possible nominees to help define the type of person who should lead the department. former georgia governor sonny perdue is trump’s leading candidate to run the department, a senior trump transition team official said last week. trump has also met with elsa murano, undersecretary of agriculture for food safety under president george w. bush, and chuck conner, head of the national council of farmer cooperatives. he has also talked with abel maldonado, former lieutenant governor of california and co owner of runway vineyards; tim huelskamp, former republican u.s. representative from kansas; and sid miller, texas agriculture commissioner. trump’s committee wants someone who is familiar with day to day farm life, can open up new markets for trade and will pressure federal regulators to ease environmental restrictions, according to a dozen committee members interviewed by reuters. “the sooner we have someone in place (as agriculture secretary), the better,” said mike strain, louisiana’s commissioner of agriculture and forestry, and part of trump’s agricultural advisory committee. a.g. kawamura, a former california agriculture secretary who is on the committee, said discussions within trump’s transition team were “free and flowing” about who should head the agency.  the usda is made up of 29 agencies and offices that perform jobs ranging from agricultural research to working with foreign governments to facilitate trade. “generally, the country knows who the proposed cabinet is going to be before inauguration day. but if i’ve learned anything this past year, it’s that you can’t make assumptions about what will happen,” he said.     john block, an illinois corn, soybean and hog producer who served as usda secretary under president ronald reagan, is certain trump will make the right choice. “we like to think we’ll see a conclusion soon, so we can look to the future,” he said. “but we have plenty of confidence in trump, and we’re hanging in there.” one key trait some are looking for: someone to stand up for farmers amid a flurry of merger deals, such as the bayer monsanto tie up. but even members of trump’s own agricultural advisory committee disagree about the deal’s merits. bayer ceo werner baumann and monsanto ceo hugh grant had a “productive meeting with president elect trump and his team to share their views on the future of the agriculture industry and its need for innovation,” according to a statement issued by both companies.  bill northey, iowa’s agriculture secretary and a member of trump’s agricultural advisory team, said he believed the president elect was paying attention to the monsanto bayer merger because rural voters supported him in the election. he said it was possible that parts of the deal might be “beneficial and pieces of it would be detrimental.” ",0
" russian aggression is to blame for violence in eastern ukraine, where people are dying in what should be seen as a “hot war” rather than a “frozen conflict”, the u.s. special envoy to the ukraine peace talks said on a visit to ukraine on sunday. kurt volker, a former u.s. ambassador to nato, was appointed to his current role on july 7 to help resolve the conflict between ukrainian troops and pro russian separatists, which has  killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.   washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to better relations with russia.  on a visit to the ukrainian held town of kramatorsk, 690 km (430 miles) southeast of kiev, volker said he would prepare a set of recommendations on how washington can better engage with the peace process. “this is not a frozen conflict, this is a hot war, and it’s an immediate crisis that we all need to address as quickly as possible,” he said. relations between ukraine and russia went into freefall after moscow’s 2014 annexation of crimea and the subsequent outbreak of a pro russian insurgency in the eastern donbass region. ukraine accuses russian of sending in its own soldiers and military equipment, which moscow denies. volker replied in the affirmative when asked whether he saw the conflict as being as the result of russian aggression rather than internal ukrainian factors. “we’ve seen what’s happened, we understand the way this conflict has begun, we understand the way it is being managed today, and that’s why it’s important that the united states become more engaged.” fighting in the donbass region has killed 12 people in a particularly bloody week, prompting germany and france to urge immediate progress in implementing ceasefire agreements signed in belarus in 2015 that are regularly flouted.  leaders of france, germany, ukraine and russia will speak by phone on monday to discuss the conflict.  u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said in early july that russia must make the first move to bring peace to ukraine, which president petro poroshenko called a powerful signal of washington’s backing. a career diplomat, volker is a former aide to republican senator john mccain, a russia hawk who wants the united states to supply lethal weapons to ukraine, a move the previous administration under barack obama shied away from.

" china and the united states must avoid being overly suspicious of each other’s strategic intentions, china’s ambassador to the united states said on wednesday while looking ahead to the presidency of donald trump. trump lambasted china throughout the u.s. election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. he has also vowed to build up the u.s. navy in what advisers say will be a strategy to reassure countries in the asia pacific worried about china’s assertive pursuit of territorial claims. china’s washington envoy, cui tiankai, told a film screening to commemorate the 1979 normalization of u.s. china ties that after “a most unusual political season,” it was important to build consensus and identify common ground. he said both countries were already cooperating on many issues, but added: “we have to make greater efforts to promote better mutual understanding and we should be careful not to be overly suspicious about each other’s strategic intentions. “there are people here in the united states who believe that everything that china does is aimed at challenging the united states’ s global dominance, and there are people who believe that everything the u.s. is doing is aimed at containing china. “i think both views are wrong.” there would inevitably be problems and challenges in the next four years, cui said, “but ... i am quite confident that, on the whole, the relationship will move forward on a stable and right track.” cui said the countries had a shared responsibility to cooperate on issues such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “we both want stability in the world. we both strive for a stronger global economy, and we both need a better natural environment. common goals call for a close partnership.”  trump and chinese president xi jinping spoke by phone on monday and xi told the u.s. president elect cooperation was the only choice for the world’s two largest economies, while trump said they had established a “clear sense of mutual respect.” nevertheless, trump’s election has created uncertainty when beijing hopes for stability as it faces daunting reform challenges at home, slowing growth and a leadership reshuffle that will assemble a new party elite around xi in late 2017.  zbigniew brzezinski, who as u.s. national security adviser drove normalization with china in the late 1970s told the same washington event the world was watching u.s. political developments “with some stupefaction.” “we are now living in a political system, a worldwide system, that is experiencing a very serious crisis... . (i)t is potentially threatening to both sides, to the well being of global stability,” he said. “you can have serious political problems in china … there are serious problems in the united states. we don’t know how we will be managing responsibilities in the foreseeable future, given some of the initial warning signals,” brzezinski said.

" democratic state senators in california on thursday unveiled a series of bills designed to freeze in place obama administration era environmental regulations in the event the trump administration moves to weaken them. the bills, collectively known as the “preserve california” package, aim to make existing federal clean air, water, and endangered species laws enforceable under state law and protect federal lands in the state from being sold to oil companies.  “the goals and objectives of these measures... is to do everything within our power to make sure the federal government doesn’t encroach on our far reaching progressive policies,” california senate leader kevin de leon said during a press conference in sacramento on thursday. the trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bills. if the bills become law, they could set the stage for legal battles between the left leaning state and the conservative trump administration, which have already clashed over president donald trump’s policies on immigration. after the presidential election, california democrats hired former u.s. attorney general eric holder, who served in the obama administration, to help in any legal battles with the trump administration. de leon said that while the state is not looking to go to court against the administration over the proposed policies, it will deploy holder as needed.  “the less that we use eric holder, the better,” de leon said. “the more we use eric holder, that means bad things are happening towards california.”  one of the bills released on thursday is designed to prevent federal lands in the state from being opened up to development and would give the state the right to halt the sales of federal land.  “there are prominent members of congress and prominent members of the trump administration who are on the record supporting a large scale sell off of our federal lands,” said senator ben allen, the bill’s author.  “either opening them up to mineral and oil and gas exploitation or direct sales to corporations who want to use those lands for commercial gain,” he said. another bill would shield whistleblowers in federal agencies who are also licensed to practice in california from losing their professional certification under state law.  it would also direct state environmental and public health agencies to protect any data under state law, even if parties in washington d.c. order their censorship or destruction, according to senator hannah beth jackson, the bill’s author.

" evangelical christian leader jerry falwell jr. will head an education reform task force under u.s. president donald trump and is keen to cut university regulations, including rules on dealing with campus sexual assault, the school he heads said.  falwell, the son of the late televangelist jerry falwell sr., was described by trump as “one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation” last year after falwell endorsed him during the republican party primary race.  read more trump vows end to prohibition on church political activity vatican worried about trump immigration order falwell is president of liberty university in lynchburg, virginia, which bills itself as the world’s biggest christian university. a school spokesman, len stevens, said on wednesday it was not clear yet when the task force would start its work.  stevens said falwell was interested in eliminating numerous regulations the u.s. department of education has placed on colleges and universities, adding that many college presidents felt the same, regardless of their political orientation.  “it’s an autonomy issue for universities to be able to not be micromanaged by the department of education,” stevens said in an email.  falwell also wants to cut federal rules on investigating and reporting sexual assault under title ix, the federal law that bars sexual discrimination in education, according to stevens.  the liberty university head believes on campus sexual assault investigations are best left to police and prosecutors, stevens said.  falwell told the associated press he turned down an offer from trump to become education secretary, in part because falwell did not want to move his family to washington.  when falwell introduced trump before a speech he gave at liberty university early last year, falwell said he saw similarities between trump and his father, the founder of the moral majority organization, including a penchant to “speak his mind.”  the senate education committee sent trump’s nomination of betsy devos, a charter school advocate, to be education secretary to the full senate on tuesday for a confirmation vote.

" a ruling by greece s top administrative court that two syrian asylum seekers can be safely returned to turkey sets a dangerous precedent for thousands of refugees, according to amnesty international. about 62,000 refugees and migrants, mainly syrians, afghans and iraqis aiming for northern europe, have been stranded in greece since european countries closed their borders in march last year. most live in overcrowded camps.   the ruling sets an ominous precedent for many other asylum seekers who have fled conflict and persecution and are currently stranded on greek islands,  said john dalhuisen, amnesty international s europe director.  these decisions breach a very clear principle   greece and the eu should not be sending asylum seekers and refugees back to a country in which they cannot get effective protection,  dalhuisen said. greece s council of state on friday rejected the appeals of the two syrians against earlier rulings, declaring their asylum claims inadmissible.  the court rejected the syrians  claims that their life and freedom would be in danger if they were returned to turkey, as the judges opined this did not emerge from any evidence,  a court official said, declining to be named. the court s ruling also took into consideration that the two syrians had links to turkey, because their families and relatives are there, the court official said. if the two syrians are deported, it will mark the first formal return of asylum seekers from greece to turkey on the basis that turkey is a safe country since an eu turkey deal came into force. the eu turkey deal, signed in march 2016, aims to return  asylum seekers from greek islands to turkey, which receives billions of euros in aid. so far under the eu turkey deal, only migrants who do not qualify for international protection have been forced to return. some syrians have returned voluntarily, authorities say.

" the united nations said on monday the mexican government is struggling to keep journalists safe and prosecute their oppressors, after officials toured regions of the country that are among the most dangerous in the world for reporters. mexican federal prosecutors have yet to secure any convictions for crimes against reporters due to ineffective probes and scant resources, said the u.n. s special rapporteur for freedom of expression, david kaye, and his counterpart from the inter american commission on human rights, edison lanza.  they released a preliminary report describing a  profound crisis of safety  after a week long tour of mexico city and the violent states of veracruz, guerrero, tamaulipas and sinaloa, and plan to release detailed recommendations in the spring.  past prosecutors didn t have the same political will to actually get the job done,  said kaye, expressing cautious hope that current prosecutors will do more to address the problem.  there s a bit more attention to getting this done right. i hope what we heard wasn t just words because we are here,  he added after the two met with 250 reporters on their trip. a news photographer in the state of san luis potosi last october was the 11th journalist murdered so far this year, according to advocacy group article 19, equaling the death toll in 2016, which was the bloodiest year for journalists on record in mexico. murders are on track to reach a record high this year, as mexico continues grappling with turf wars between violent drug gangs that have convulsed the country for more than a decade. in the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in mexico, 38 of them under the administration of president enrique pena nieto. kaye said the prosecutor s office tasked with investigating attacks on reporters, formed in 2006, needs to deter such crimes by committing substantial resources to solving a single high profile case, or a handful of them.   until that happens, there will be very little prevention, and very little ending of this cycle of violence,  kaye said.   he and lanza also said mexico s government must devote more funding and staff to a journalist protection program launched in 2012, taking measures such as daily monitoring of the situation in states where reporters are most at risk, and helping them to continue to work if they are forced to leave their homes.  it has an amount of money that s absurdly insufficient for the emergency that it s facing,  lanza said.

" lebanon has identified the bodies of 10 of its soldiers found along the syrian border in a zone taken back from islamic state last week, state news agency nna said on wednesday. an offensive against the enclave ended with the evacuation of islamic state militants and their families to eastern syria under a hezbollah brokered deal.  syria s government and lebanon s hezbollah allowed a convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and 300 relatives to evacuate, surrendering their border enclave. as part of the agreement, is militants identified where they had buried the soldiers, lebanon s army chief said. dna tests confirmed that all 10 bodies found in the mountainous border region were lebanese soldiers, security sources and local media said on wednesday. islamic state had held territory along the border for years, and took lebanese troops captive in 2014 when they briefly overran the town of arsal with other militants, one of the worst spillovers of the syrian conflict into lebanon. lebanese justice minister salim jrayssati said a military court would look into whether any civil or military authorities played a role in their capture. president michel aoun called for an investigation last week.  at a conference on wednesday, the families of the soldiers demanded an inquiry to punish anyone who led to the deaths during the fighting and negotiations since 2014.  for three years, they had protested in the streets and met with many government officials to find out the fate of their relatives.  there is immense and deep sadness in our hearts. but in our minds, there is pride and dignity,  hussein youssef, the father of a soldier, said at the government headquarters in beirut. prime minister saad al hariri declared friday a national day of mourning after meeting with the families.  they were martyred defending this country,  said nizam mougheit, whose brother died in islamic state captivity.  anyone who had a hand in their martyrdom should be held accountable, whoever it is.

" a record crowd paid their respects to japan s 84 year old emperor akihito at tokyo s imperial palace on saturday, in his first birthday celebration since the date of his abdication was set. the emperor s birthday is traditionally marked by a national holiday and an address at the imperial palace, which opens to the public on the day. well wishers waved small japanese flags and held up smartphones as emperor akihito, whose position is ceremonial with no political power, addressed them from a balcony, flanked by his wife and other members of the imperial family. the crowd of 52,300, according to the imperial household agency, was the largest birthday attendance during akihito s symbolic 29 year reign, known as the  heisei  era, which means  achieving peace  in japanese.  on this day as we face the cold, my thoughts go out to those who suffered from typhoons and heavy rains, as well as the victims of the great east japan earthquake who continue to lead difficult lives,  he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed and displaced tens of thousands on the country s eastern seaboard. along with empress michiko, akihito has spent much of his reign addressing the legacy of world war two, which was fought in the name of his father, hirohito, and consoling victims of disasters such as the 2011 earthquake.  earlier this month, a 10 member imperial household council agreed that akihito would step down on april 30, 2019, before passing the chrysanthemum throne to his eldest son, crown prince naruhito. in comments made to media, akihito said he would use the remaining days of his reign to carry out his duties and prepare to  pass the torch to the next era.  akihito has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer and said last year that he feared he would struggle to fulfill his royal duties due to his age. japan passed a law this year allowing him to step down in a one off provision as existing law did not provide for abdication. the last time a japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817. throughout his reign, akihito has consistently urged the japanese never to forget the horrors of war. his conciliatory remarks contrast with gestures made by prime minister shinzo abe, who has adopted a less apologetic tone over japan s past military aggression.

" the fate of president donald trump’s order to ban travelers from six predominantly muslim nations, blocked by federal courts, may soon be in the hands of the conservative majority supreme court, where his appointee neil gorsuch could help settle the matter. after the richmond based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals declined on thursday to lift a maryland federal judge’s injunction halting the temporary ban ordered by trump on march 6, attorney general jeff sessions said the administration would appeal to the supreme court. a second regional federal appeals court heard arguments on may 15 in seattle in the administration’s appeal of a decision by a federal judge in hawaii also to block the ban. a ruling by the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals is pending. the justice department has not made clear when the administration would make its formal appeal or whether it would wait for the 9th circuit ruling before appealing.  if they take it up, the justices would be called upon to decide whether courts should always defer to the president over allowing certain people to enter the country, especially when national security is the stated reason for an action as in this case. they also would have to decide if trump’s order violated the u.s. constitution’s bar against the government favoring one religion over another, as the ban’s challengers assert. gorsuch’s april confirmation by the republican led senate over democratic opposition restored the court’s 5 4 majority, which means that if all the conservative justices side with the administration the ban would be restored regardless of how the four liberal justices vote. during his senate confirmation hearing, gorsuch was questioned about trump’s criticism of judges who ruled against the ban. gorsuch avoided commenting on the legal issue, saying only that he would not be “rubber stamp” for any president. while the justices could decide in the coming weeks whether to hear the case, they likely would not hold oral arguments until late in the year, with a ruling sometime after that. a final resolution may not come until perhaps a year after trump issued the executive order. the justices are not required to hear any case, but this one meets important criteria cited by experts, including that it would be the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction.  the administration could file an emergency application seeking to put the order into effect while the litigation on its legality continues. at least five justices must agree for any such request to be granted. while the court could split 5 4 along ideological lines, it also is possible some conservative justices could join the liberals in overturning the travel ban, libertarian law professor ilya somin of george mason university said. “conservatives in other contexts often take a hard line against any kind of government discrimination (based) on race or religion or the like, even if the motivation may be benign. also conservatives have concerns about government infringements on religion,” somin said. the 4th circuit said the ban’s challengers, including refugee groups, in the case argued by the american civil liberties union were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violated the constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any religion. in the 10 3 ruling, three republican appointed judges dissented. the republican president’s march 6 order, replacing an earlier jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, called for barring people from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days while the government implements stricter visa screening. it also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. the travel ban’s challengers may take some comfort from the appeals court ruling’s reliance on a concurring opinion in a 2015 supreme court immigration case by justice anthony kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court’s liberals in big cases. in the 2015 case, kennedy wrote that in the immigration context, the government’s actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith. “as with any opinion by justice kennedy, i think the million dollar question is just what he meant in his concurrence, and this may be a perfect case to find out,” university of texas school of law professor stephen vladeck said. in thursday’s ruling, 4th circuit chief judge roger gregory wrote that the plaintiffs had shown there was “ample evidence” of bad faith, which gave the green light to probe whether there were reasons for the order other than the administration’s stated national security rationale. the administration has argued the temporary travel ban was needed to guard against terrorist attacks. gregory wrote that the order uses “vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.” trump during the presidential campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” ",0
" thai airlines can now add flights to the growing china, south korea and japan markets after the u.n. international civil aviation organization removed a red flag against thailand over safety concerns, officials said on monday. thailand was downgraded in june 2015 after its regulator missed a deadline to resolve significant safety concerns, meaning that airlines were unable to add further international routes, though they could continue to operate routine flights. the civil aviation authority of thailand (caat) said the icao had made the decision after a meeting on friday. the montreal based u.n. agency was not immediately available for comment, but the red flag which appeared against thailand on its website had disappeared.  although lifting the red flag is a significant turning point for her aviation industry, thailand as well as caat need to carry on their missions to improve the aviation safety standards,  the caat said on its website.   shares in thai airways climbed nearly 8 percent on the news before falling back to trade at over 5 percent higher. shares in asia aviation, which operates as thai air asia, rose as much as 5 percent and later traded up nearly 4 percent. shares in airport operator airports of thailand rose over 2 percent.  the biggest beneficiaries would be smaller carriers, such as thai airasia x, nokscoot and thai lion, said corrine png, the ceo of singapore based transport research firm crucial perspective.  the icao downgrade had seriously impeded these new entrants  growth to lucrative markets such as japan and south korea,  she said.  these airlines can now grow more aggressively. this would, however, imply increased competition for thai airways when they expand.  thai airasia x ceo nadda buranasiri said his airline was studying new routes, including to hokkaido in japan, after the red flag was lifted.  we will likely increase routes and frequencies for china, south korea, and japan,  he told reuters on monday, adding thai airasia x now hoped to add three to four aircraft to its fleet next year.  nok airlines pcl vice chairman patee sarasin said new routes would be added as slots became available. thai airways lacks enough aircraft to take advantage of the situation and expects rivals will boost routes to other asian countries, said a source at the national carrier who declined to be named because he wasn t authorized to speak to the media. thai airways declined to comment. caat director general chula sukmanop told a news conference that he expected thailand would regain a category one status from the u.s. department of transportation s federal aviation administration (faa), which also downgraded thailand in 2015. the faa downgrade meant thai carriers could not start new routes to the united states. the caat said its aim was to be at  the world s forefront  in safety and reach the global average in each safety category. actions were still needed to address findings of an icao inspection in january 2015 and an audit in july, it said. icao s red flag was based on its audit of the regulatory body, rather than individual airlines. some major thai airlines, including thai airways, bangkok airways, thai lion and nokscoot, have passed the international air transport association operational safety audit, a benchmark for global safety management in airlines. aviation safety is particularly important for thailand given that tourism accounts for around 12 percent of its economy, the second largest in asia. the countries which still have red flags against them are djibouti, eritrea, haiti, kyrgyzstan and malawi, according to the icao list.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency’s scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether epa chief scott pruitt violated the agency’s policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by reuters on friday. lawyers for environmental group the sierra club had asked the epa’s office of inspector general to check whether pruitt violated policy when he told a cnbc interviewer on march 9, “i would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” the epa inspector general’s office responded to the sierra club on thursday in an email, saying it had referred the matter to the epa’s scientific integrity officer, francesca grifo, for review. “if after the sio review, she concludes there is some aspect of the letter itself, or her findings or conclusions that she believes are appropriate for further consideration by the oig, she will so notify the oig,” the email stated. a spokeswoman for the epa defended pruitt’s comments. “administrator pruitt makes no apologies for having a candid dialogue about climate science and commonsense regulations that will protect our environment, without creating unnecessary regulatory burdens that kill jobs,” said liz bowman in an emailed statement. “differing views and opinions on scientific and technical matters is a legitimate and necessary part of epa’s decision making process, which is consistent with epa’s scientific integrity policy that was in place even during the obama administration,” she added.  the epa website says its scientific integrity policy requires epa officials and staff to ensure the agency’s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. an overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. the request by sierra club ramps up tension between the u.s. environmental movement and the administration of president donald trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the u.s. economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. grifo is a biologist who was hired by former president barack obama’s administration. before she joined the epa in late 2013, she oversaw scientific integrity at the union of concerned scientists, a non partisan group advocating stronger environmental protections.  pruitt, a former attorney general for oklahoma, sued the epa more than a dozen times over its regulations as top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.

" charles “chuck” johnson is not the kind of foot soldier in the army of lobbyists that house of representatives speaker paul ryan warned would descend on washington to fight the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s. johnson, 53, with a degree in social work and another from a  theological seminary, heads the national council for adoption, a small organization in alexandria, virginia that represents adoption agencies and adoption lawyers. despite a relative lack of clout, parents of adopted children and adoption advocates beat back a minor change in the tax code that would have removed a tax credit to help cover the costs of adoption. politics in washington favors the moneyed and the connected, especially big business and special interest groups rich enough to employ legions of lobbyists to advocate on their behalf.  but many of the taxpayers affected by president donald trump’s tax overhaul have little or no influence on congress, where republicans are looking to end a host of tax credits and deductions for medical expenses, moving expenses and alimony in order to pay for their big tax cuts. the bill will cut corporate tax, provide a tax holiday for corporations’ overseas profits and cut the tax rate for the wealthy. “everyone in corporate america had an army ready and in place to push for simplifying the tax code,” said michaela sims stewart, president of the lobbying firm sims strategies.  in contrast, parents of adopted children “naturally came together” to form a “small but mighty group,” said stewart.  stewart also happens to be a spokeswoman for adoption tax credit working group, which brought together a host of organizations, some with strong republican and conservative ties, to pressure the house leadership to drop the change. part of the tax code since 1998, the adoption tax credit was used by nearly 74,000 people in 2014, according to the internal revenue service.  the adoption advocates started a social media campaign on facebook and twitter to alert parents of the change. “we expected adoptive families to rally in support, but when groups like focus on the family, national right to life, u.s. conference of catholic bishops, prominent clergy such as russell moore, and even the lgbt community joined, the media took an interest,” said johnson, of the national council for adoption. with the publicity, pro family republican politicians were suddenly in the position of having to explain the elimination of what the coalition had successfully cast as a pro child policy. the house proposal was dropped nov. 2 and the senate didn’t even bother to make it part of its version of the tax bill. while adoptive parents were ultimately successful in their fight, others have struggled to be heard. graduate students staged walkouts on dozens of campuses this week to protest one republican proposal that would increase their tax burden. it would require graduate students to pay taxes on tuition payments that are waived by their university as if it were income. in other words, the students would be required to pay taxes on money they never had to begin with.      few of the republican proposals to end deductions or tax credits will yield a lot of money for a government that spends $4 trillion a year. ending alimony deductions, a benefit in the tax code since 1954, might raise $8.3 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by congress’s joint committee on taxation. no longer letting teachers write off $250 of what they shell out of their own pocket for classroom supplies might yield $2.1 billion over the same period, the committee says. the change affecting adoption might bring in less than $50 million over the next decade. the committee did not break out what ending medical deductions would yield. even though the stakes are high for them, advocates for people with disabilities and chronic diseases say they lagged in fighting cuts in medical expense deductibility, as well as removing a tax break to companies that make handicap accessible structural changes, and a tax credit for businesses that hire people with disabilities. the tax breaks were not explicitly for people with disabilities, and the advocates had not expected they would be in congress’s crosshairs.  these less than powerful voices may yet be heard as the senate prepares to vote on its bill this week. they may get another chance when the house and senate compromise on a single piece of legislation to vote on and pass to trump.

" u.s. president donald trump called the u.s. air traffic control system out of date on thursday and criticized its $10 billion yearly price tag but stopped short of calling for privatization of the program. “i hear we’re spending billions and billions of dollars, it’s a system that’s totally out of whack,” trump said during a picture taking session at the white house ahead of his sitdown with airline and airport executives. his comments heartened advocates of privatization who have long sought to move away from the system they see as outdated.  “we want to get the government out of the role of managing the air traffic control system,” gary kelly, southwest airlines co’s chief executive officer, told trump during the picture taking session.  the federal aviation administration spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has about 28,000 air traffic control personnel. trump said he had been informed that ongoing modernization efforts to the air traffic control system were already obsolete by the pilot of his private jet.  “i hear the government contracted for a system that’s the wrong system,” trump said. “it’s way over budget, it’s way behind schedule and when it’s complete it’s not going to be a good system.” the faa has spent nearly $3 billion since 2007 to implement an updated system, “nextgen,” which would utilize satellites to monitor aircraft instead of radar and make other changes.     “nextgen is one of the most ambitious infrastructure and modernization projects in u.s. history,” the agency said in a statement. “the faa invited airline stakeholders to help develop the blueprint for nextgen and they continue to have a seat at the table in setting nextgen priorities and investments through the nextgen advisory committee.” the government accountability office said in a 2016 report that the united states “is generally considered to have the busiest, most complex and safest atc system in the world.” (bit.ly/1q9oiof) the chief executives of united airlines inc, delta air lines inc, southwest and jetblue airways corp were among those who attended the meeting. after the meeting, airports council international north america president and ceo kevin burke told reporters on a conference call that airport officials had urged trump to lift the cap on airport passenger fees to address airport infrastructure needs.  trump proposed during his campaign to spend $1 trillion over a decade to upgrade the country’s infrastructure. trump also told the executives he recognized that u.s. airlines were facing pressure from foreign carriers. heads of the three largest u.s. passenger carriers   american airlines group inc, united and delta   have urged the trump administration to denounce the u.s. open skies agreements with the three major middle eastern carriers, which they accuse of having been unfairly subsidized by their governments.     the three airlines, qatar, etihad and emirates [emira.ul], have denied that their governments unfairly subsidize them. the gulf airlines operate around 200 flights per week to 12 u.s. cities. “i know you’re under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers,” trump said, adding that he wants foreign carriers also to do well. “they come with big investments, in many cases those investments come from their governments, but they are still big investments,” he said.

" iranian state television broadcast on sunday what it described as the confessions of an iranian academic with swedish residency who it said had provided information to israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.  his wife, speaking by telephone from stockholm, said he had been forced by his interrogators to read the confession. iran s supreme court upheld last week a death sentence against ahmadreza djalali, a doctor and lecturer at the karolinska institute, a stockholm medical university. djalali was arrested in iran in april 2016 and later convicted of espionage. he denied the charges. in the television report, djalali was linked to the assassination of four iranian scientists between 2010 and 2012 that tehran said was an israeli attempt to sabotage its nuclear energy program.  djalali said in the report that he had given the israeli intelligence agency mossad information about key nuclear scientists.  they were showing me pictures of some people or satellite photos of nuclear facilities and were asking me to give them information about that,  djalali said in the television report. vida mehrannia, djalali s wife, said her husband had been forced to read a pre agreed confession in front of the camera.  after three months in solitary confinement, his interrogators told him that he would be released only if he reads from a text in front of the camera,  she told reuters by telephone from stockholm.  my husband told me that they shouted at him each time he was saying something different from the text and stopped the filming,  mehrannia added. the film said djalali had agreed to cooperate with israel in return for money and residency of a european country.  we have not received money from anyone and our lifestyle shows that. we don t have a house or a car. we got our swedish residency after finishing our studies here,  mehrannia said. the film also contained interviews with majid jamali fashi, an iranian athlete who was hanged in 2012 over the killings of the nuclear scientists. djalali is the second person found guilty in the same case.  djalali did not have any sensitive information about iran s nuclear program. if he had, he would have been barred from leaving the country,  mehrannia said. sweden has condemned the death verdict against djalali and said it had raised the matter with iranian envoys in stockholm and tehran. seventy five nobel prize laureates petitioned iranian authorities last month to release djalali so he could  continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind . they said djalali has suggested it was his refusal to work for iranian intelligence services that led to this  unfair, flawed trial . the united nations and international human rights organizations regularly list iran as a country with one of the world s highest execution rates.  iran s revolutionary guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years, mostly on spying charges.

" kosovo s prime minister called on friday for an international investigation after some of his countrymen were convicted of taking part in a gun battle with macedonian police. the men were part of a group of ethnic albanians jailed in neighboring macedonia on thursday, some of them for life, on charges of plotting attacks and clashing with the police in a 2015 shootout. crowds took to the streets of kosovo s capital after the sentencing, accusing the macedonian authorities of staging the attack. protesters in the eastern kosovan town of gjilan burned the macedonian flag.  kosovan media and officials have regularly said the accused albanians were innocent and the victims of a plot by macedonia s former nationalist government   an allegation dismissed by skopje.  justice must be done,  kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj said in a statement.  an international investigation would help find the truth which we are all demanding.  he did not say who or what should carry out the inquiry. kosovo s foreign minister, behgjet pacolli, said he had called his ambassador in skopje for consultations and asked for a  clarification  from the macedonian ambassador in pristina, without going into further details. most of the defendants in thursday s hearing were from neighboring kosovo, while others were from macedonia s own albanian minority. they all denied the charges.     the 2015 shootout occurred during a police raid that followed an attack by armed men on a border post. some of them were former guerrillas from the national liberation army (nla), an ethnic albanian militia that had fought an insurgency in 2001 in which scores of people were killed. macedonia, a small ex yugoslav republic of about two million people, declared independence in 1991 and mostly avoided the violence that accompanied the break up of yugoslavia in the 1990s, until the clashes with ethnic albanian fighters in 2001. albanians are believed to make up around 30 percent of macedonia s population, living mostly in the northwest near the borders with kosovo and albania.

" the november u.s. presidential election is being sold by the major parties as a defining moment for the next generation of americans. but stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big ‘meh.’ options bets on volatility around the nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, bnp paribas said. typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events. the cboe volatility index, the most widely followed gauge of near term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four month high after the brexit vote. but there is little to suggest that november is a big worry for stocks. investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. they might also be taking the view that both the republican and democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said. “it’s like the opposite of ‘alien vs. predator,’” said mark sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund karman line capital in chicago, referring to the 2004 american science fiction film which had the tagline ‘whoever wins, we lose.’ “here, no matter who wins, wall street does better,” he said. despite being called anti business by some on wall street, the obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record. per bnp paribas data, s&p 500 index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period. had there been a big bump up in this measure for november it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts. “the market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period,” said stewart warther, an equity derivatives strategist at bnp paribas. market makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations. if stock volatility does not pick up in november, that would be a departure from the norm, according a bnp paribas analysis of data going back to 1948. “the shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but it’s not like there is a huge hump out in november,” said steve sosnick, an equity risk manager at timber hill, the market making unit of interactive brokers group inc. “we have seen some demand for options but i would say it’s hardly a frenzy.” ",0
" new jersey taxpayers will owe $2.62 million for roughly a year’s worth of work by a team of professionals called in to help turn around the distressed gambling hub atlantic city, according to invoices obtained and compiled by reuters. it is not clear what taxpayers have to show for it. despite the work by a state appointed emergency manager and the law and accounting firms he hired, so little progress has been made in reversing the seaside resort’s fortunes that lawmakers are now considering a full takeover of city operations. reuters reported in september that the amount was $2.15 million, but invoice reports since then for additional work by restructuring lawyers at skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom have pushed the total up by 20 percent. reuters obtained the documents through a public records request. governor chris christie appointed kevin lavin as emergency manager on jan. 22, 2015. since then, lavin’s team has produced one report, in march.  the press of atlantic city this month obtained a non public  draft of a follow up report. a spokesman for lavin told reuters last week that a report is expected “within the coming weeks.” four of the city’s eight casinos closed in 2014, pummeled by  competition from neighboring states. that contributed to a 70 percent reduction in the city’s property tax base, to a projected $6 billion this year from $20.5 billion in 2010.  lavin and his team   including skadden, ernst & young llp [erny.ul], and mediator donald steckroth   were to review and propose solutions to the city’s immediate fiscal crisis, suggest possible longer term fixes and negotiate with labor unions. separately, the state had already appointed a monitor and had to approve the city’s budget and hiring. but lawmakers are seeking an even firmer grasp. on tuesday, they introduced legislation that would strip atlantic city’s elected officials of most of their control, except for the ability to file for municipal bankruptcy. “you can’t justify a $262 million budget for 40,000 people. it’s obscene,” senate president steve sweeney, a co sponsor of the bill, said earlier this week. “(the mayor and city council) need to make the tough decisions now.” mayor don guardian and city council members denounced the takeover proposal. guardian said on wednesday the city trimmed $14 million from its 2015 budget and expects to cut $16 million more this year.

" democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton consulted national security advisers on tuesday after weekend bomb blasts renewed fears of domestic attacks, as republican donald trump accused her of pushing policies that made the united states less safe. the two rivals in the nov. 8 election have been vying to portray themselves as the best equipped to protect the nation.  the domestic security issue returned to the forefront after a new york city bomb injured 29 people, a pipe bomb went off and unexploded bombs turned up in separate incidents in new jersey, and a man stabbed 10 people at a minnesota mall.  clinton spoke by phone with former defense department official michele flournoy, former cia deputy head mike morell and other advisers, her campaign said in an email.  “we can’t lose our cool and start ranting and waving our arms,” clinton said on the call, according to her campaign in an apparent reference to trump. “we shouldn’t toss around extreme proposals that won’t be effective and lose sight of who we are. that’s what the terrorists are aiming for.” the call was supposed to be open to news media, but when reporters called in, they could not hear anything. clinton’s campaign provided notes to reporters afterward. clinton has called for better intelligence, new efforts to counter online recruiting of militants and smashing islamic state strongholds in the middle east. she has said trump’s rhetoric against what he calls “radical islamic terrorism” is helping islamic state recruit more fighters. at a rally in high point, north carolina, trump countered by saying that clinton, as democratic president barack obama’s first secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, backed policies that made the united states less safe. “i’m much tougher than her on this horrible situation, but she goes around saying it’s a recruiting tool,” trump said. the new york businessman accused clinton of supporting policies in iraq and syria that he said allowed islamic state to take root.  trump has pointed to the pullout of u.s. troops from iraq in 2011   which occurred after the obama administration and iraqi leaders could not agree on the withdrawal   and what he has characterized as a push for regime change in syria. a u.s. led coalition has conducted air strikes on islamic state in iraq and northern syria. trump also criticized clinton for supporting the entry of some syrian refugees into the united states, reiterating his call for tougher vetting of people seeking admission. he has instead proposed safe zones for refugees, which he says gulf states would fund. “there’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money,” trump said at a rally later on tuesday in kenansville, north carolina. on monday, u.s. authorities arrested ahmad khan rahami following a shootout with police in linden, new jersey, in connection with the saturday night bombing in manhattan’s chelsea neighborhood. rahami, 28, is a naturalized american citizen born in afghanistan. law enforcement officials were also investigating the stabbings, also on saturday night, at the st. cloud, minnesota, mall as “an act of terrorism. an off duty policeman fatally shot the attacker, dahir adan, 20, whom an islamic state news agency claimed as “a soldier” of the militant group. reuters could not verify the claim. adan came from a somali family that settled in the united states. at the kenansville rally, trump said he would dislodge a political establishment that he said ignored working people. “they go to the same restaurants, they go to the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections, they write checks to the same think tanks and produce the same papers, it’s a gravy train that never ends,” trump said. democrats, in turn, criticized trump’s business activities. u.s. senate democratic leader harry reid called the real estate developer a “fraud” in a speech on the senate floor, pointing to his multiple bankruptcies and lawsuits. clinton’s campaign repeated its call for trump to release his tax returns after the washington post reported trump’s charitable foundation had spent thousands of dollars to settle lawsuits involving his businesses.

" u.s. president barack obama and european leaders on friday underscored the importance of working together in nato and chided russia for its bombing of syria and failure to implement a ukrainian peace accord. the white house statement followed a meeting at which obama sought to reassure his counterparts from germany, britain, spain, italy and france that his successor donald trump would not break up the transatlantic alliance. trump raised concerns during the campaign when he said he could withhold military aid from nato allies if they had not met their defense commitments and said he would forge closer ties with russian president vladimir putin. “president obama expressed confidence that, even at a moment of great change, democratic values have done more to advance human freedom and progress than any other system in history, and will continue to do so going forward,” the white house said. the leaders agreed on the need to work together to stabilize the middle east and north africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolutions for the conflicts in syria and eastern ukraine. european leaders had sought obama’s support as they prepare to extend sanctions imposed on russia by washington and brussels in 2014 following its intervention in eastern ukraine, and consider fresh sanctions over russia’s actions in syria, where it backs syrian president bashar al assad. german chancellor angela merkel told a news conference with spanish prime minister mariano rajoy that no decisions had been made about extending the ukraine sanctions, but actions to implement the minsk peace accord were not sufficient. merkel said the leaders discussed their concerns about syria during their meeting on friday, but did not talk about imposing syria related sanctions against russia that have been sought by the syrian opposition. obama and the eu leaders called for an immediate end to attacks on rebel held parts of the city of aleppo by syrian government forces and their allies russia and iran that monitoring groups say have killed dozens this week alone. syrian opposition officials on friday met eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini and other officials and urged them to focus on protecting civilians and lifting the siege, said anas al abdah, who heads the syrian national coalition. he said he had hoped for stronger words from obama and the eu leaders, and called for washington and brussels to put more “real pressure” on russia and iran. u.s. and eu officials have stressed the need for a political solution, including the departure of assad, but trump has said he views the fight against islamic state as a bigger priority. eu leaders are expected to extend sanctions related to ukraine in december or january. obama and the european leaders “unanimously agreed on the continued need for russia to fully meet its commitments under the minsk agreements and that ukraine related sanctions against russia must remain in place until it does so,” the white house said. they said a durable ceasefire in eastern ukraine was needed to move forward with free and fair local elections in the occupied regions of donetsk and luhansk.

" rating agency moody s warned on tuesday that reopening lebanon s political vacuum after the resignation on saturday of prime minister saad al hariri would damage the tiny country s credit rating.   a drawn out political stalemate less than a month after the government passed its first budget in 12 years would undermine recent institutional improvements and expose the banking system to a loss in confidence,  it said in an emailed note.   any loss of confidence in the banking system or in the  stability of lebanon s institutions leading to a significant slowdown in private sector deposit inflows or outright outflows would be credit negative,  it added.  lebanon s central bank governor, finance minister and banking association head have all issued statements assuring that lebanon s monetary and financial situation is stable.  the country s fragile economy has one of the world s highest debt to gdp ratios and is underpinned by its banking system.  hariri resigned in a televised broadcast from saudi arabia on saturday, taking lebanon s political elite by surprise, and plunging beirut into a political crisis.  president michel aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to lebanon to explain his reasons, putting off the difficult political consultations among lebanese factions to form a new government.  as the most influential politician in the sunni community, which in lebanon s sectarian system must fill the position of prime minister, hariri has no obvious successor.

" activist shareholders plan a record number of resolutions focused on climate change at u.s. company annual meetings in 2017, even as president elect donald trump looks set to loosen environmental regulations. based on filings so far, u.s. companies are on track to face roughly 200 resolutions on climate matters at their shareholder meetings next year, according to rob berridge, who follows the subject for ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.  there were 174 such resolutions this year, berridge said, compared with 167 in 2015 and 148 in 2014. many have been directed at big oil and gas companies, though other sectors have also been targeted, including technology and retail. activist shareholders broadly aim to curb companies’ carbon emissions and make energy usage more efficient, or at the very least, to draw the attention of companies and investors to climate change as an urgent problem.  they have had some limited success. investors at exxon mobil corp the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, passed a measure this year that could lead to an environmental activist joining its board. “our position is that the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action,” said exxon spokesman alan jeffers. the rising number of shareholder votes reflects a growing concern among big investors about the environment, encouraged by steps by some boards to embrace reforms.  deadlines are fast approaching to get resolutions on the ballot for shareholder meetings to be held in the spring. the election victory of trump, who is set to take over as u.s. president on jan. 20, only seems to have added impetus.  on the campaign trail, trump dismissed human caused climate change as a “hoax” and pledged to dismantle the environmental protection agency. he also threatened to withdraw the united states from the landmark 2015 paris agreement to combat climate change, although he appeared to step back from that position on tuesday. he vowed instead to revive the u.s. coal industry, encourage oil drilling and to scale back regulation of the energy sector.  “despite what the administration may or may not do, i really believe that corporations understand the risks posed by climate change,” said danielle fugere, president of as you sow, a  california nonprofit campaign group. it sponsored 18 climate related shareholder resolutions in 2016 and expects to file a bigger number next year. one resolution for 2017 calls on anadarko petroleum corp to report on how it would address the risk of so called stranded assets, such as high cost deepwater project investments, that might be caused by a drop in demand for oil and gas. the idea won support from 42 percent of shares voted at the company’s 2016 meeting, up from 29 percent in 2015. anadarko’s board last year called the idea “unnecessary and unproductive.” spokesman john christiansen said it is reviewing the proposal. to be sure, among s&p 500 companies, investor support for climate resolutions has been relatively weak, holding steady around 22 percent since 2014, according to research firm fund votes.  but activists often won more backing for ideas such as urging companies to report on their strategy for dealing with climate change, according to the sustainable investments institute, a research firm specializing in shareholder votes, supported by universities, pension funds and other institutional investors.  anne simpson, director of sustainability for the california public employees’ retirement system (calpers), which manages about $300 billion, said it plans to file or back resolutions at u.s. oil and gas companies for 2017, though she declined to discuss specifics.  last year the boards of mining companies including rio tinto plc and glencore plc endorsed resolutions calpers submitted calling for reports on climate risk, and the measures passed by wide margins.  more companies will likely embrace shareholder proposals to head off disruption caused by climate change, simpson said. “economics is driving this, not politics,” she said.

" the waters of rome s trevi fountain, one of italy s top tourist attractions, turned red on thursday after a man dumped dye into the main pool, a city official said. police detained the man responsible, a statement from the mayor s office said, as city officials assessed if there had been any damage to the 18th century landmark. the fountain, where tossing a coin into the pool is supposed by superstition to guarantee one s return to the eternal city, is a big tourist attraction in rome. actress anita ekberg famously frolicked in the fountain s pool in the 1960 film  la dolce vita .  acts like this demonstrate ignorance and a total lack of civic sense,  deputy mayor luca bergamo said. italian media said the culprit was the same person who dyed the fountain red in 2007 to protest the cost to the city of hosting an international film festival. thursday s action took place on the opening day of rome s 2017 film festival.

" u.s. vice president mike pence walked out of a national football league game on sunday after some players knelt during the national anthem, a form of demonstration that began last year in silent protest against police violence toward racial minorities. pence was attending a game in his home state of indiana between the indianapolis colts and the san francisco 49ers.  when the national anthem was played before the start of the game, some 49ers knelt while some colts, their arms locked, wore black t shirts with the words “we will” on the front and “stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back.  “i left today’s colts game because president trump and i will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our national anthem,” pence said in a statement issued by the white house. dallas cowboys owner jerry jones said after his team’s game on sunday that he would bench players who disrespect the u.s. flag. “if there is anything that is disrespectful to the flag then we will not play,” jones told reporters. asked about pence’s departure, jones said: “we cannot in the nfl in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag. “i know the vice president did leave, because in his opinion the teams were,” he said, adding: “there is no question in my mind that the national football league and the dallas cowboys are going to stand up for the flag.” but the nfl players association in a statement defended players’ right to protest. “we should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our constitution protects,” the association said, adding, in words that borrowed from the national anthem, “that is what makes us the land of the free and the home of the brave.” after pence’s departure, critics began to question whether he had only attended the game in order to make a production of leaving, pointing out he flew from las vegas on saturday and was then going to fly to california on sunday evening. pence had planned for “several weeks” to attend sunday’s colts game, where former quarterback peyton manning was being honored, an official in his office said, asking not to be named. additionally, he made a last minute decision to travel to las vegas for a prayer service on saturday, the official said. “as he had discussed with the president, when several 49ers players disrespected the flag and the national anthem, the vice president decided to leave the game,” the official said. president donald trump said in a tweet on sunday that he had asked pence to leave the stadium “if any player kneeled, disrespecting our country.” nfl spokesman brian mccarthy declined to comment. the first amendment of the u.s. constitution bars the government from limiting free speech, including prohibiting protests of the national anthem or punishing people who choose not to stand. the national anthem is played before every nfl football game and many other sporting events. less than an hour after issuing pence’s statement, the white house released a picture of him and his wife at the stadium where the game took place, standing with hands over their hearts during the performance of the national anthem. trump’s criticism of the nfl players has played well with his conservative base while he grapples with controversies over iran and north korea, an investigation of russian meddling in the 2016 election and policy struggles in congress. pence’s team indianapolis defeated san francisco, 26 23, in overtime.

" a criminal justice bill awaiting a vote by the u.s. senate would reduce federal prison costs by $722 million over the next 10 years by releasing thousands of federal prisoners early, congressional forecasters said on wednesday. federal benefits received by the newly released prisoners would increase direct spending by $251 million and reduce revenues by $8 million over the same period, according to the estimate by the u.s. congressional budget office. the new savings estimate buoyed supporters of the bipartisan measure to lower mandatory minimum sentences for some non violent federal drug offenders, which is central to president barack obama’s efforts to overhaul the country’s federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding.  “we have an obligation to change the way we think about incarceration, and today’s cbo report shows that we have a fiscal obligation as well,” said the bill’s co authors, u.s. senators charles grassley, a republican from iowa, and richard durbin, a democrat from illinois, in a statement. the bill was revised last month to exclude prisoners convicted of violent crimes in an effort to garner more support among conservatives.  still, its prospects for moving to a full senate vote remain unclear. some key republican senators are reluctant to support the bill until it includes changes to “mens rea” laws that govern criminal intent.  parallel sentencing reforms await a floor vote in the u.s. house of representatives. a white house study last month found that current sentencing and incarceration policies strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the u.s. economy.

" residents of new jersey’s southern shorefront towns on monday cleaned up homes and businesses flooded by a storm surge during the weekend’s massive blizzard and rued what they described as governor chris christie’s dismissive treatment of the damage. the storm that walloped washington and new york with about 2 feet (60 cm) of snow hit coastal cape may county in new jersey with tides higher than those measured during 2012’s superstorm sandy, sending salt water into properties and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. jim hand voiced exasperation as he surveyed the damage at fred’s tavern in stone harbor, a bar and liquor store about 35 miles (56 km) down the coast from atlantic city. hand, a member of the third generation of his family to own the shop, said that the property’s kitchen, electrical wiring and floors would all need to be replaced. “we’re doing the same thing today we did after sandy,” said hand, 61. he was one of a handful of local business owners to criticize comments by christie, a republican white house contender who told cnn on sunday that he had “no concerns” about flooding as a result of the storm.  “keep this in perspective,” christie told cnn during a one day return to the state from the campaign trail in new hampshire. “cape may county area was the least flooded area during hurricane sandy and had almost no damage in that area.” no immediate estimate of the financial toll of the flooding damage was available but reinsurance broker aon benfield said that total insured losses along the east coast will run into the billions of dollars.     hand had no patience for christie’s words, saying, “it shows you how out of touch he is with what’s going on in his state.” angry comments from new jersey residents immediately flashed across twitter and raged into monday, some showing images of street flooding and tagged to christie with comments like “nothing to see here.”  christie spokesman brian murray said that the governor’s words had been taken out of context. “cape may county and lower atlantic county did not sustain the direct hit from sandy suffered by more northern parts of the jersey shore. but the governor did not say they were not impacted by sandy,” murray said. “he only cautioned news reporters to use some context when pointing to saturday’s flooding in cape may and saying it’s ‘worse than sandy.’” sandy was directly responsible for 147 deaths in the united states, destroying more than 650,000 homes around the greater new york area and causing nearly $50 billion in damage. christie said in a statement on monday that he had sent teams to the storm hit areas to determine whether the damage was  severe enough to seek federal assistance, a process that he said could take days. children’s clothing store owner maggie day sprayed an anti bacterial mix over her ruined merchandise as she surveyed the damage to her shop in stone harbor in cape may county.    “i did walk away from sandy with a lot of damage,” said day, 39, who had to replace flooring, walls, insulation and merchandise after the 2012 storm and was working with a “water excavator” to get a handle on the latest damage. “it’s not even help that i’m asking for,” day said. “it’s just a little bit of compassion with a public leader on tv. you can’t pooh pooh it publicly when you’re a leader.”     ",0
" president donald trump should not have pardoned a former arizona sheriff who was convicted of criminal contempt in a case of racial profiling, the republican speaker of the house of representatives, paul ryan, said on saturday. trump announced on friday he was pardoning joe arpaio, an anti immigration hardliner found guilty last month for flouting a 2011 court order that barred officers from detaining latino motorists solely on the suspicion they were illegal immigrants. “law enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rights of everyone in the united states. we should not allow anyone to believe that responsibility is diminished by this pardon,” ryan said in a statement. “the speaker does not agree with the decision,” ryan’s spokesman doug andres said. some other prominent republicans, including arizona senator john mccain and former florida governor jeb bush, have also criticized trump for the controversial pardon. arpaio, 85, was an outspoken supporter of trump’s presidential campaign and both men have argued for tougher policies against illegal immigration. as president, trump has broad powers to issue pardons and he had said arpaio was convicted for “doing his job”.  arpaio lost his own bid for re election in arizona’s maricopa county in november, after 24 years in office.

" congressional republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down obamacare following donald trump’s election as u.s. president, including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation. trump’s victory on tuesday means republicans will control the white house, senate and house of representatives. but congressional democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. the affordable care act, dubbed obamacare, has provided 25 million previously uninsured americans with health coverage. republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach. wyoming senator john barrasso, a member of senate republican leadership, said one way for the incoming president and congress to attack obamacare immediately after trump takes office on jan. 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of health and human services, the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law. “we could confirm someone on jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states, to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers,” barrasso said in a telephone interview. barrasso noted that the senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100 seat chamber to confirm cabinet members, as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the democrats could present to repeal legislation. passing repeal legislation “is not a ‘day one’ activity. but a new secretary of hhs going after the regulations can be a ‘day one’ activity,” barrasso added. trump during the campaign called obamacare “a disaster” and joined fellow republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax free health savings accounts. his transition website says trump wants a solution that “returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states.” in repealing obamacare, congressional republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around democrats in the senate, where rules protect the rights of the minority party. republicans in congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of obamacare in january, but obama vetoed the legislation. the bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage, as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law, and would have eliminated expansion of the medicaid insurance health insurance program.  republican representative chris collins of new york, one of trump’s earliest supporters on capitol hill, said he hopes congress can pass a similar bill gutting obamacare within trump’s first 100 days in office, a promise trump made during the presidential campaign. but some changes will doubtless be phased in over time, collins said. “there’s nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone’s health insurance plan for 2017,” collins said in an interview. “from a replacement standpoint, our position has always been as republicans to move forward in a step by step fashion,” barrasso said. in an interview with the wall street journal published on friday, trump said he was considering retaining parts of obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions. while waiting for congress to act on legislation, the new hhs secretary could be reworking obamacare regulations, barrasso said. for example, regulations could give u.s. states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law, such as exemptions from the so called individual mandate requiring americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it. kim monk, an analyst at capital alpha partners, which provides policy research to financial institutions, said trump’s hhs might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for obamacare. insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill. hhs might also be able to alter the language on “essential benefits” that the law requires insurance plans to cover, which include trips to the emergency room, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services, monk said. “the law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories, but how that gets defined, a lot of that is interpretative,” monk said. “and of course, everything the obama administration interpreted was more, more, more, more expensive coverage, and all these things lead to premium increases.” collins, a member of the trump transition team’s executive committee, said the job of hhs secretary or surgeon general “would be great for ben carson,” referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination and later endorsed trump.

" a japanese court sentenced a former u.s. military base worker to life in prison on friday for the rape and murder of a woman on the southern island of okinawa, public broadcaster nhk reported. the naha district court found kenneth franklin shinzato, 33, guilty of killing 20 year old rina shimabukuro in april last year, nhk said. a court spokesman told reuters he was unable to immediately confirm the decision.   the case sparked anger on the island, where locals have long protested the presence of u.s. military bases that they say imposes a heavy burden on okinawa. okinawa hosts around 50,000 u.s. nationals, including 30,000 military personnel and civilians employed at the bases. in a bid to assuage locals, the united states last year agreed to limit legal protection and benefits to some u.s. civilian contractors working for the military in japan under a status of forces agreement (sofa) that dates back to 1960.  sofa exempts personnel from requiring visas while in japan, and has been criticized because it has been used by the u.s. military to ship people home before japanese police can capture them.  other incidents involving u.s. personnel have stirred resentment among okinawans. on nov. 19, a local man was killed in road accident after his van collided with a car driven by a u.s. marine suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. the u.s. military responded by imposing a drinking ban for personnel in japan on or off base.

" senate republicans released their “skinny bill” that would repeal some of obamacare late on thursday, just hours before they were expected to vote on the legislation. many republican lawmakers said they did not want the eight page bill to become law, and held off supporting it until they received assurances from house of representatives speaker paul ryan that members of both chambers could set up a special committee that would craft new legislation.  senate republican leaders said the bill was simply a way to keep alive the seven year promise to repeal and replace obamacare, which was also a top campaign promise from president donald trump. the senate failed to pass two major bills earlier in the week that would repeal or replace the healthcare law after spending months on both pieces of legislation.  the affordable care act, known informally as obamacare, brought insurance to 20 million previously uninsured americans and was the signature domestic achievement of former democratic president barack obama. republicans say the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in healthcare.  here’s what’s in the “skinny” repeal bill, formally called the health care freedom act:  the bill repeals an obamacare penalty on individuals who do not purchase health insurance. it also repeals a penalty for eight years on employers with more than 50 employees that do not provide health insurance.  the legislation repeals a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device sales, until dec. 31, 2020. if it were to become law, this repeal would be welcome news to manufacturers such as medtronic inc and abbott laboratories inc.  the senate bill effectively defunds planned parenthood for one year by prohibiting medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, from reimbursing the women’s healthcare provider. the majority of planned parenthood patients are on medicaid.  unlike previous attempts to craft legislation to repeal or replace obamacare, the skinny bill does not end the law’s medicaid expansion or make changes to the federal health program.

" the families of thousands of victims in the philippines  bloody war on drugs mourned on wednesday at gatherings in churches and cemeteries in the capital, manila, to call for justice.   priests at a special catholic service on a gloomy all saints day prayed for and blessed photographs of those killed, and some relatives held a protest outside a police station whose officers have been blamed for deaths. president rodrigo duterte unleashed his signature anti narcotics campaign immediately after taking office in june last year. human rights groups believe many of the 3,900 deaths in police operations were summary executions. the police deny the accusations, saying the drug suspects were armed and had violently resisted arrest. thousands of filipinos flocked to cemeteries on all saints  day, known as  todos los santos,  to pay their respects to the dead by cleaning tombstones, placing flowers and lighting candles.   one important reason for celebrating  todos los santos  with the families is to remember their loved ones and draw inspiration and courage to seek truth and justice for those killed because of this war on drugs,  catholic priest gilbert billena said during the service. nearly 80 percent of the philippines  population of 100 million is catholic, the vast majority of whom still practice with enthusiasm. relatives sang hymns and wept, surrounded by placards calling for justice beside photographs of the slain, while a poster nearby read,  address the roots of drug addiction.   normita lopez, whose second born djastin lopez was gunned down by police in may, mourned over her son s tomb at manila s largest public cemetery.  sometimes i talk to him, i tell his picture,  son, please visit me. i want to see you. i want to hug you, because i wasn t able to,  lopez said.   i really miss him now. i miss him so much. i miss his laugh. i miss his company.  lopez said her 25 year old son had been accidentally caught in a police anti drug sweep near their slum community in manila and was allegedly framed for the death of a resident they did not know. there was no immediate response to a reuters  text message to a police spokesman to seek comment. police have earlier said those targeted in anti drugs operations were involved in the drug trade or figured on a drugs watchlist. last month, duterte ordered police to withdraw from the anti narcotics campaign and leave all operations to the philippine drug enforcement agency, following scrutiny of police conduct.

" arab countries and qatar should enter into direct talks to solve a diplomatic dispute, russia s foreign minister said on a trip to saudi arabia on sunday, urging all parties to restore regional unity. saudi arabia, bahrain, the united arab emirates and egypt severed ties with qatar on june 5, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups   a charge it denies.  we have confirmed our position (that we are) in favor of settling the disagreements by means of negotiations, by directly expressing concerns and achieving solutions which would take into account the concerns and the interests of all parties,  the minister, sergei lavrov, told a news conference in jeddah.   we are interested in all those mediatory efforts that are currently being made producing results and the unity of the gulf cooperation council (gcc) being restored,  he added. kuwait and the united states have been mediating to reach a breakthrough in the three month long crisis that has put the whole region on edge, and prompted turkey to send troops to the wealthy gulf state in a sign of support.  last week, saudi arabia suspended any dialogue with qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts , just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of both countries suggested a breakthrough in the gulf dispute. saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir told the news conference that qatar needed to show seriousness in finding a solution to the crisis.  we want clarity in the qatari position, we want seriousness in finding a solution to this crisis that leads to the implementation of principles which all countries support: no supporting terrorism, no welcoming unwanted guests, no spreading hate, no intervention in others  affairs,  jubeir said.  the two ministers also discussed the planned de escalation zones in syria and unification of the syrian opposition.  the kingdom supports the creation of de escalation zones and looks forward to starting a political process that will end the syrian crisis,  jubeir said. president bashar al assad s negotiators have not met directly with the opposition because there is no unified delegation from the high negotiations committee (hnc) and two other groups, known as the cairo and moscow platforms, all claim to represent the opposition.

" the united states will give israel $38 billion in military assistance over the next decade, the largest such aid package in u.s. history, under a landmark agreement signed on wednesday. the deal, whose details were reported by reuters earlier, will allow washington’s chief middle east ally to upgrade most of its fighter aircraft, improve its ground forces’ mobility and strengthen its missile defense systems, a senior u.s. official said. while the package constitutes the most u.s. military aid ever given to any country, it entails concessions by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, according to officials on both sides. those include israel’s promise not to seek additional funds from congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package, and to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed israel to spend part of its u.s. aid on its own defense industry instead of on american made weapons, the officials said. nearly 10 months of drawn out aid negotiations underscored continuing friction between president barack obama and netanyahu over last year’s u.s. led nuclear deal with israel’s arch foe iran, an accord the israeli leader opposed. the united states and israel have also been at odds over the palestinians. but the right wing netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with obama, who leaves office in january, rather than hoping for better terms from the next u.s. administration, according to officials on both sides. a new pact now allows him to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether democrat hillary clinton or republican donald trump, and to give israel’s defense establishment the ability to plan ahead. obama’s aides wanted a new deal before his presidency ends, seeing it as an important part of his legacy. republican critics accuse him of not being attentive enough to israel’s security, which the white house strongly denies, and of taking too hard of a line with the israeli leader. the $38 billion memorandum of understanding covers u.s. fiscal years 2019 2028 and succeeds the current $30 billion mou signed in 2007, which expires at the end of fiscal 2018. “prime minister netanyahu and i are confident that the new mou will make a significant contribution to israel’s security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,” obama said in a written statement. the agreement was signed at the state department by u.s. undersecretary of state thomas shannon and by jacob nagel, acting head of netanyahu’s national security council. according to a white house “fact sheet,” the deal includes:  annual payments of $3.3 billion in so called foreign military financing  $500 million a year for israeli missile defense funding, the first time this has been formally built into the aid pact.  a phasing out of a special arrangement that for decades has allowed israel to use 26.3 percent of the u.s. aid on its own defense industry instead of on american made weapons.  elimination of a longstanding provision that has allowed israel to use about 13 percent of the u.s. aid to buy military fuel.  the funding will allow israel to update “the lion’s share” of its fighter aircraft, including purchasing additional f 35 joint strike fighters. israel is scheduled to receive 33 f 35 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered in december.

" ukraine plans a 12 percent increase in health spending next year to exploit reforms passed last week to raise standards and crack down on corruption in hospitals and surgeries, government ministers told reuters. ukrainians die earlier than most europeans and patients often bribe doctors for treatment or medicine. kiev s western backers see healthcare reforms as a test for ukraine s push for closer ties to the european union, away from russia. new legislation will create a national insurance system that pays doctors by the number of patients they have. hospitals will be paid for services through the new system, rather than receiving lump sums from regional administrations as is now.   it also allows patients to choose their doctor for the first time, rather than being tied to the doctor where their residence is registered, a move the government says will encourage medics to improve and gives them less scope to demand backhanders. health minister ulana suprun said that patients  mindsets will also need to change.   people in ukraine think that paying the doctor cash, under the table, is somehow a  thank you  for the services that are supposed to be provided to them at no cost,  she said in an interview.  there needs to be a big cultural change as well, so that we teach people that they re not supposed to do that.   she cited a survey by the national anti corruption bureau which found 65 percent of ukrainians had come across corruption in the past year, of which 68 percent was in healthcare.  and finance minister oleksandr danylyuk told reuters in an email ukraine will hike health spending by 12 percent to 114 billion hryvnia ($4.28 billion) in 2018, and is ready for a further increase later because the reform is a government priority. ukraine has emerged from a steep recession caused by the annexation of crimea and the outbreak of a russian backed separatist insurgency in 2014.  but the economy is still propped up by a $17.5 billion aid program from the international monetary fund that is conditional on reforms and progress in tackling corruption. with no end in sight to the conflict in the donbass, defense spending accounts for at least 5 percent of gdp.  the ministry of finance is one of our biggest supporters,  suprun said of the planned rise in spending.   they re big supporters of what we re doing because they re finally going to be able to follow the money all the way down to a patient. whereas now we hand money out to hospitals and we don t really know what is done with it at that point.   a u.s. born doctor, suprun moved to ukraine in the early days of the maidan demonstrations in november 2013, and wound up treating the gunshot wounds of protesters in the final days of pro kremlin leader viktor yanukovich s rule.   the reforms went through 893 amendments while suprun says she was targeted by a smear campaign, including by some who  questioned whether she had faked her diploma.  the new legislation is just the first step, she says,  because reform never is easy. people don t want to change. they re used to the system that there is, and there s a lot of people making a lot of money off of this.   healthcare professionals told reuters they welcomed the reforms.  oleksandr ivanko, chief doctor at the kiev municipal clinical hospital, hoped doctors  salaries would improve  because you cannot motivate them and demand anything while paying a minimum or even humiliating salary.

" a german court ruled on wednesday that a 96 year old german known as the  bookkeeper of auschwitz  was fit to go to prison, rejecting his plea for the sentence to be suspended. oskar groening, who is physically frail, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for his role in the murder of 300,000 people at the nazi death camp auschwitz. however, he had not started serving his sentence due to a legal argument about his health. prosecutors said in august that a medical examination showed groening was fit to start serving his prison sentence, though groening s lawyer disputed that. on wednesday a court in the northern german town of celle said:  the higher regional court thinks, based on expert opinion, that the convicted man is able to serve his term despite his advanced age.  it said enforcing groening s sentence would not breach his fundamental rights and added that special needs related to his age could be catered for in prison. in a 2015 court battle seen as one of the last major holocaust trials, prosecutors said although groening did not kill anyone himself while working at auschwitz, in nazi occupied poland, he helped support the regime responsible for mass murder by sorting bank notes seized from trainloads of arriving jews. groening, who admitted he was morally guilty, said he was an enthusiastic nazi when he was sent to work at auschwitz in 1942, at the age of 21.  some 6 million jews were murdered during the holocaust carried out under adolf hitler.

" details of potential obamacare replacements by u.s. house republicans emerged in news reports on friday, as republican lawmakers have vowed to introduce new legislation in the coming weeks. republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal to repeal and replace the affordable care act, the signature domestic policy of former democratic president barack obama.  still to be worked out are details including the future of medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor that was expanded in more than 30 states under obamacare, and how a new healthcare law would be funded.  one emerging scenario among republicans is that the millions of people who received health coverage through the expansion of medicaid would be “grandfathered in,” according to the washington post. states that did not expand medicaid could receive more money through increased federal “disproportionate share” payments used to help hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients.  and a draft republican replacement plan for obamacare, which news outlet politico uploaded to its website, would cap the amount of money given to states for medicaid and end tax subsidies based on income for the purchase of individual plans in 2020.  house staffers would not comment on the authenticity of the document, which was dated feb. 10. president donald trump and republicans have said they would present a plan for repealing and replacing obamacare in the coming weeks.   it is not clear whether there is sufficiently broad support among republican lawmakers for all of the measures in the draft proposal, or how the plans might change as they move through congressional committees.  the draft “addresses the major issues and is a serious proposal for transitioning out of obamacare,” said ed haislmaier, a senior research fellow and healthcare policy expert at the heritage foundation who was on trump’s transition team.  “clearly the details will continue to evolve and we’ll be watching as they do,” he said in an emailed statement to reuters. u.s. health insurance executives, many of whom have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the obamacare individual insurance markets, are due to meet with trump on monday, according to a bloomberg report. a blue cross blue shield association spokeswoman confirmed it was invited to the meeting and will attend. republicans have repeatedly pledged not to “pull the rug out” from millions of americans who gained access to healthcare under the law, and recent polls show more respondents favoring obamacare than opposing it.  the kaiser family foundation found broad bipartisan support for maintaining federal funding for the medicaid expansion, with 84 percent of respondents saying it was important to do so, according to a survey released on friday. the poll also found the law has record levels of support, with more americans now viewing it favorably than unfavorably.  “obamacare has failed. we welcome any and all efforts to repeal and replace it that put patients first,” said caitlin oakley, a spokeswoman for the u.s. department of health and human services. democrats decried the draft proposal on friday and said it would cause millions of americans to lose their health insurance.  “the deeply harmful path house republicans have laid out would spell disaster for families nationwide,” u.s. senator patty murray, a washington state democrat, said in a statement. “president trump, who promised families he would provide insurance for everyone, should be the first to oppose it.” ",0
" former german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was elected president of germany s bundestag or lower house of parliament, on tuesday at its first session after sept. 24 elections. schaeuble, a member of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives, agreed last month to step aside as finance minister, clearing the way for another party to take the job as part of tricky negotiations to forge a new coalition government. schaeuble, 75, is known for his hardline insistence on a balanced budget and his leadership during the euro zone crisis, but he faces new challenges in leading the bundestag, which will include a far right party   the alternative for germany (afd)   for the first time in decades.

" u.s. supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg on thursday said she regrets making critical comments about republican presidential contender donald trump. “on reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill advised and i regret making them,” she said in a statement issued by the court. ginsburg, the 83 year old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the u.s. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about trump in a series of media interviews.  her earlier remarks prompted criticism from trump, who said she should resign. in one of a series of twitter posts, he also said ginsburg’s “mind is shot.” the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ginsburg’s statement. legal ethics scholars also questioned ginsburg’s actions, saying supreme court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. the new york times and the washington post chided ginsburg in editorial articles. “judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. in the future i will be more circumspect,” ginsburg said. in a cnn interview posted on tuesday, ginsburg called the presumptive republican nominee “a faker.” in a separate interview with the new york times, ginsburg joked about moving to new zealand if trump wins the white house. under a code of conduct that federal judges   but not supreme court justices   are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.  supreme court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate. the controversy erupted as trump prepared for the opening of the july 18 21 republican convention, which will formally make him the party’s presidential nominee for the nov. 8 election. the supreme court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative justice antonin scalia died in february.

" colombia s armed forces have been authorized to launch air raids against crime gangs and farc members who have refused to adhere to a peace accord with the former guerilla group and instead chose to continue drug trafficking and other criminal activity, the defense ministry said on tuesday. as many as 1,000 members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) have not abided by the terms of last year s peace agreement with the government, preferring instead to remain armed, fight the government and profit from illegal drugs and mining. the conflict killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964. the executive order allows troops to conduct bomb attacks against farc dissidents and crime gangs from airplanes and helicopters, and shields the military from criminal prosecution, the defense ministry said in a statement. raids can only be carried out if civilians are not close by. air raids were the most effective weapon in the government s fight against the farc, pushing fighters deep into inhospitable jungle and killing high level rebel commanders. that strategy also has been used against the national liberation army (eln), now the biggest active guerrilla group in colombia, which is  in peace talks with the government. the two sides began a bilateral ceasefire in october. more than 11,300 members of the farc, including fighters, urban militia and prisoners are in the process of being incorporated into society after the group handed in its weapons to the united nations and formed a political party.

" president donald trump and democratic leaders in the u.s. congress have agreed to work together on legislation to protect “dreamers,” the illegal immigrants who were children when they entered the united states, the lawmakers said on wednesday, although a dispute erupted over exactly what had been agreed. following a dinner with trump at the white house, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the “productive meeting” focused on “daca,” a program established by former president barack obama. “we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca (deferred action for childhood arrivals) into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides,” schumer and pelosi said in a statement. all year, democrats have insisted that they will block any legislation that contains funding for a wall along the length of the u.s. border with mexico, a top trump campaign goal that many republicans in congress also do not support. while white house officials have suggested legislation on daca could move forward without wall funding, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders disputed the characterization that a deal had been reached to leave it out of any legislation focused on the dreamers. “while daca and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,” she said on twitter. throughout his 2016 campaign for president and since taking office in january, trump has demanded the construction of a wall to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. he initially said mexico would pay for the wall but has requested money from the u.s. congress after the government of mexico refused to pay. the dinner was the latest effort in a new initiative by trump to work with opposition party democrats on major legislation. following the dinner, a white house official said the president, schumer and pelosi discussed tax reform, immigration, border security, infrastructure investments and trade as part of trump’s bid to reach out to democrats. “the administration looks forward to continuing these conversations with leadership on both sides of the aisle,” the official said. over a dinner of chinese food, trump and the democratic leaders also discussed issues related to u.s. china trade, according to a congressional aide briefed on the meeting. schumer and pelosi also said that they urged trump to make permanent government subsidy payments under the affordable care act, also known as “obamacare.” “those discussions will continue,” the lawmakers said. trump and most republicans in congress have demanded the repeal of obamacare but have been unable to agree on a replacement for the healthcare program that became law in 2010. using his executive powers, trump canceled obama’s daca program in which about 800,000 undocumented young people have escaped the threat of deportation and been able to apply for work permits in the united states. trump argued that obama over stepped his authority in creating the program. but trump gave congress six months to come up with a replacement program in the form of legislation to be enacted into law. democratic representative henry cuellar, who attended a white house meeting with trump earlier on wednesday, told reporters the president said he would not insist on wall funding as part of a dreamers bill, but would pursue it on other, future legislation. cuellar said trump urged lawmakers to link a republican bill to cut legal immigration to the united states with protections for dreamers. but many democrats oppose lowering the cap on annual legal immigration.

" russia’s foreign ministry declined on tuesday to confirm or deny reported plans by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson to visit moscow, expressing its surprise at the “regular leak” of information from washington. sources told reuters on monday tillerson planned to skip his first meeting of the 28 nato allies in april in order to stay home for a visit by china’s president and then go to russia. russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said in response to media requests for confirmation of tillerson’s moscow visit that the ministry was “not prepared to confirm or deny this information”. “but we are certainly surprised by the regular leak of sensitive information from washington,” she said in a post on facebook. “it’s time for u.s. political elites to figure out if ‘russian hackers’ have once again got into state department servers or if the threat to u.s. cyber security has an american origin after all,” zakharova said.  deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said later he was unaware of plans by tillerson to visit moscow. skipping the nato meeting and visiting moscow could risk feeding a perception that trump’s administration may be prioritizing u.s. dealings with big powers over smaller nations that depend on washington for security. tillerson worked with russia’s government for years in his former role as a top executive at exxon mobil corp. he has questioned the wisdom of sanctions against russia that he said could harm u.s. businesses.

" ugandan police raided the office of a local newspaper, detaining staff and confiscating equipment on allegations it had published an inaccurate story, the paper s lawyer and police said on wednesday.  the day before the tuesday evening raid, red pepper, uganda s leading tabloid, published a story alleging that rwanda believed president yoweri museveni of uganda was plotting to oust president paul kagame. the article cited unnamed sources. the government said there were no tensions between uganda and rwanda. police spokesman emirian kayima said eight managers and editors at the newspaper s kampala head office were detained after police searched the paper s kampala office and confiscated computers and mobile phones.  kayima said the eight staff were being held at a detention facility in eastern uganda and would appear in court when investigations were complete.  he said the story contained  serious statements and insinuations...that have grave implications on national and regional security and stability.     the paper s lawyer maxma mutabingwa said uniformed police told red pepper staff during the search that they wanted  material and information on a story published on monday . he said some managers  homes were also searched but gave no details.  red pepper was not published on wednesday and staff had not been allowed to access the offices since the raid, mutabingwa said.  human rights groups say harassment of independent media by security personnel has been escalating in the east african country where museveni, 73, has ruled for 31 years. local media including red pepper have reported this month on tensions between uganda and neighboring rwanda over a range of economic and security disputes.   there s no tension between uganda and rwanda...we have no problem at all (with rwanda),  uganda s foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman, margaret kafeero, told reuters.  she said uganda had not received any official complaint from rwanda regarding any allegations of a plot against kagame and that the reports in ugandan media were  rumors . relations between the two countries are often complicated by a shared history which has by turns been a source of mutual suspicion and amity.  kagame, the rwandan leader, grew up as a refugee in uganda and also occupied a top position in the ugandan army after serving in the guerrilla movement that helped museveni take power in 1986.  the rwandan leader launched his own rebellion from uganda that ushered him into power and halted a genocide in rwanda in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed.

" alex azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive, is u.s. president donald trump’s top pick to run the department of health and human services, two sources with knowledge of the confidential process said on condition of anonymity on wednesday. azar served at eli lilly for a decade, including five years as president of its u.s. lilly usa, llc unit. the white house declined to comment. tom price resigned as hhs secretary in september after about seven months in the post, after facing sharp criticism for his use of taxpayer funded private travel.  before his stint at eli lilly, azar served as general counsel and deputy secretary for hhs under president george w. bush. the new hhs secretary will be tasked with implementing trump administration efforts to unwind obamacare, a top campaign promise of his, and overseeing the drug industry, which trump has said is “getting away with murder” by charging high prices for prescription medications. azar has served on the board of directors of the biotechnology innovation organization, a drug industry lobby, for several years, and his nomination would raise questions about the administration’s seriousness about lowering drug prices. other names that have been floated to replace price include  seema verma, administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services, and scott gottlieb, the food and drug administration commissioner. republicans control both chambers of congress and the white house but have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace obama’s affordable care act, prompting trump to take steps on his own to dismantle the program. the trump administration followed through on a threat to cut off billions of dollars of subsidy payments to insurers, shortened the obamacare open enrollment period, slashed advertising for the program by 90 percent and cut funding to groups that help people sign up for health insurance.  in october trump also signed an executive order that would weaken obamacare by making it easier for americans to buy bare bones health insurance plans. the administration is already planning changes for 2019. last month, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. under obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.

" french finance minister bruno le maire will meet german officials in berlin this week to discuss the future of the euro zone and assess his own prospects of becoming the next chairman of the eurogroup forum of finance ministers. french and german officials confirmed le maire would be in berlin on wednesday, when he will meet acting finance minister peter altmaier, a close ally of german chancellor angela merkel. le maire is also due to see christian lindner, leader of the liberal free democrats (fdp), and cem oezdemir, co leader of the greens party. both are in discussions with merkel s conservatives on forming a coalition government. france s emmanuel macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five year presidency. but any changes will require the support of merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before christmas. lindner has been critical of macron s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.   we want to follow up on the president s sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,  a french finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by macron in september when he laid out his vision for eu reform. while le maire s visit   his first to berlin since the german election   is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out berlin on the eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month. since it was created in 2005, the eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: luxembourg s jean claude juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former dutch finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in january. the position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. the post has been dubbed  mr euro . le maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. but some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either germany or france, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking. a further complication for le maire is france s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. german officials are not ruling out le maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country. last week, one official in berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: pierre gramegna of luxembourg and peter kazimir of slovakia. the official also floated the idea of extending dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of berlin, even though he is not part of the new dutch government.  it is still quite unclear who will come forward,  the german official said when asked about the presidency.  at this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. there is no natural candidate.  the eurogroup president will be chosen on dec. 4, an eu official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid november.  it is not a done thing,  the german official said of le maire s candidacy.  he will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.     the talks in berlin on wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring. if le maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. mario draghi will end his term as president of the european central bank on oct. 31, 2019, and germany s jens weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor. euro zone watchers say that if the french secure the presidency of the eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a german candidate taking over the ecb. still, as one senior french official told reuters on condition of anonymity last month, weidmann at the helm of the ecb  would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for france .

" facebook said on wednesday its efforts to fight fake news during germany s national elections included taking down tens of thousands of fake profiles in the final month of the campaign. richard allan, facebook s vice president of public policy for europe, middle east africa, said the silicon valley based company mounted an array of efforts to ensure the social media network was not used as a platform to manipulate public opinion.  these actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election   but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people s news feeds,  the facebook executive said in a statement. news feed is the central feature in user profiles whereby they can see updates from people they follow. chancellor angela merkel s christian democratic union secured victory in sunday s balloting with fewer votes than expected, forcing her to enter complicated coalition talks with various parties to form a new government. the company said it made a stronger push to remove fake accounts when it observed suspicious activity following widely reported foreign interference in the french and u.s. presidential elections over the past year. besides seeking to encourage civic participation and voter education efforts, it also worked closely with authorities, including the federal office for information security (bsi), to monitor security threats during the campaign.   studies concluded that the level of false news was low,  concluded allan, a former british member of parliament who, in addition to his work for facebook, has been a member of the house of lords since 2010. a variety of german political experts and social media watchers had given the campaign largely a clean bill of health in terms of any wide scale efforts to swing votes in the run up to voting day.

" marawi resident baimona amintao hopes her turn comes quickly once authorities begin raffling off the first batch of temporary shelters for those who lost their homes to the five month battle to retake the southern philippine city from islamist militants.  amintao and her five children were among the thousands of families displaced since fighting erupted in marawi on may 23, when security forces tried to arrest isnilon hapilon,  islamic state s  emir  in southeast asia.  the philippines on monday announced the end of military operations in marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war in the country s biggest security crisis in years, paving the way for rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts to begin. more than 1,000 transitional houses, with basic bathroom and cooking facilities, could be completed within two months on the outskirts of marawi, the philippine housing agency has said. residents whose homes were devastated will get first priority in allotment raffles that could be held either before or after construction.   i hope i can be included in the raffle and be able to stay there for my children s well being,  amintao, 26, who formerly owned a small grocery store, told reuters.  many people here prioritize their children since many of the kids cannot stand living inside the tents and are getting sick.  the government estimates the rebuilding of marawi could cost at least 50 billion pesos ($971 million). authorities said 920 militants, 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict, which displaced more than 300,000 people. philippine president rodrigo duterte has placed the southern island of mindanao, where marawi is located, under martial rule to help security forces in crushing the rebel movement.     the rebel occupation stunned a military inexperienced in urban combat and stoked wider concerns that islamic state loyalists have gained influence among local muslims and have ambitions to use the island as a base for southeast asia operations. those fears are compounded by the organization of the militant alliance and its ability to recruit young fighters, lure foreign radicals, stockpile huge amounts of arms and endure 154 days of ground offensive and air strikes. the social welfare department said more than 5,000 families still live in covered gymnasiums and tent cities.  i could not fathom what happened to our village and i hope this does not happen again,  said alniah magoyag, a village official.  no more terrorists in marawi city.

" the white house has eliminated nearly 60 requirements for agencies to submit paperwork that it has deemed out of date or unnecessary in a bid to begin making the federal government operate more efficiently, u.s. budget director mick mulvaney said on thursday. the office of management and budget, which mulvaney heads, has directed agencies to come up with plans to streamline their operations. as a part of this push, the budget office reviewed 253 of its guidance and policy documents and found that 59 were no longer needed. president donald trump has pledged to reorganize the federal government and to do away with onerous rules and policies that slow down administration priorities and increase the cost of governing. some of the paperwork that the budget office deemed unnecessary included old requirements for submitting plans for y2k, the effort to get computer systems up to date for the year 2000. another scrapped requirement was that agencies develop 10 to 15 page business plans for contracts over $50 million. under a new process, agencies will use a three page template. the white house has directed agencies outside of omb to conduct reviews of their own paperwork obligations to see what can be removed. mulvaney also said the white house would begin assessing the various government reports to congress that are required by statutes to develop a list of those that lawmakers should consider rescinding.

" president vladimir putin formally registered his re election bid on wednesday, submitting the necessary documents to russia s central election commission in person ahead of a march 18 vote.  polls show that putin, who has dominated russia s political landscape for the last 17 years as either president or prime minister, is on course to comfortably win another six year term. that would allow him to rule until 2024, when he ll turn 72. the former kgb officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a  father of the nation  rather than as a party political figure. the ruling united russia party and the just russia party have both said they will support him. allies laud putin for restoring national pride and expanding moscow s global clout with interventions in syria and ukraine. but opposition leader alexei navalny, who has been barred from the election over a suspended prison sentence he says was fabricated, says putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents.  navalny has called for a boycott of the election, raising the prospect of large scale protests and clashes with the police.

" atlantic city’s mayor has called a state plan to cede control of the fiscally distressed gambling hub a “fascist dictatorship,” a sharp reversal of his previous position on the proposed takeover. details of the proposed legislation, released last week, would deny residents their civil rights by stripping municipal powers from locally elected officials, mayor don guardian said on monday, echoing previous concerns from community activists. “the final piece of legislation that the state presented to us was far from a partnership,” guardian said, addressing hundreds of residents and city workers at an outdoor news conference next to city hall. “it was much worse. it was absolutely a fascist dictatorship.” the plan calls for the state to appoint an official who would have the power to make unilateral decisions about canceling collective bargaining agreements, selling city owned assets, entering contracts, terminating employees and vetoing city council minutes, guardian said. the mayor’s comments marked a fiery change of tone from just one month ago, when guardian stood next to new jersey governor chris christie and state senate president steve sweeney in support of the intervention. however, that was before the bills had taken shape. city officials previously threatened to file for a municipal bankruptcy. but such a move would likely not be approved by the state, which already oversees the city’s budget. nevertheless, officials raised the subject again on monday, saying they might petition the state for a bankruptcy declaration if they cannot negotiate a settlement with the borgata casino hotel & spa.  atlantic city owes the borgata, its most profitable casino, at least $160 million of property tax appeals. the city missed a recent deadline to pay a $62.5 million portion of that, prompting the borgata to skip its $7.5 million tax payment for the first quarter of 2016.  the parties are in 45 day court ordered negotiations, guardian said, but if there is no settlement the city could try to seek out bankruptcy. atlantic city is on track to run out of money within two months. the latest legislative package would also include a less divisive bill that allows casinos to make fixed payments in lieu of taxes. that bill is aimed at stabilizing the city’s property tax base, which has shrunk dramatically because of gambling competition from neighboring states. four of the city’s 12 casinos that shut in 2014 remain closed.

" michigan governor rick snyder said he had “no reason to be concerned” he would be charged in connection with the flint drinking water crisis that exposed city residents to high levels of lead, the detroit free press reported on thursday.   snyder made the comments to the newspaper on wednesday, the day after two flint emergency managers appointed by the governor were indicted on felony charges of conspiring to violate safety rules. “i have no reason to be concerned,” snyder was quoted as saying, while acknowledging he could not speak on behalf of state attorney general bill schuette. both snyder and schuette are republicans. snyder told the paper much of the $3.5 million in taxes he is using for his criminal defense was being spent to find and prepare records requested by schuette and the u.s. attorney’s office, which is also investigating the water scandal. schuette has filed 43 criminal charges against 13 current and former state and local officials, including the emergency managers this week. snyder’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the interview. flint has been at the center of a public health crisis since last year, when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the poor, predominantly black city of about 100,000 residents. critics have called for charges to be brought against the governor, who has been in office since 2011, as well as other high ranking state officials. snyder has said he believes he did nothing criminally wrong. asked at a news conference on tuesday whether the investigation would lead to charges against senior state officials, schuette said no one was excluded from the probe.  flint’s water contamination was linked to a switch of its source to the flint river from lake huron in april 2014, a change made in an attempt to cut costs, while the city was under state run emergency management.

" u.s. republicans in congress are grappling with a thorny question about corporate taxes as they work to reconcile competing tax bills from the senate and house of representatives into a unified measure that they hope president donald trump will sign into law before the end of the year. the senate bill that squeaked through on a 51 49 vote last week jettisoned a long held republican goal of repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) to help pay for last minute deals that secured the republican votes for passage. that puts senate republicans on a collision course with republicans in the house of representatives, whose own tax bill repeals the corporate amt and who are already calling for the tax to be eliminated in final legislation.  house and senate republicans also face potential sticking points over how their bills treat so called pass through enterprises, top earners, the estate tax on inheritances and international tax policy for corporations. but the corporate amt could be the biggest challenge, because removing it could require lawmakers to cover a $40 billion revenue loss over a decade, possibly by scaling back their plan to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. the 20 percent corporate amt is an alternative to the regular corporate income tax in computing taxes owed. it is designed to limit the ability of corporations to reduce their tax bills through various deductions and credits, such as a credit for research and development that is especially popular with silicon valley technology companies. corporations must compute taxes using both methods and then pay whichever rate is higher. with the top corporate rate now at 35 percent, few wind up paying the amt. because both the house and the senate bills would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, the same as the corporate amt, there is concern that corporations would not be able to use the r&d credit. “i think that has to be eliminated,” house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california said of the corporate amt in a cnbc interview on monday.  the house voted 222 192 on monday to go to conference with the senate on tax legislation, setting up formal negotiations that could take weeks to complete. a similar senate vote could come later this week.  the decision to retain the corporate amt in the senate bill helped keep the legislation’s overall revenue loss within an agreed upon limit of $1.5 trillion. “there would need to be some sort of alternative to raise that revenue and there isn’t a lot of latitude to make further trades,” said jared walczak, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan tax foundation, a washington think tank. senator john cornyn, the no. 2 republican in the senate called that “the $64,000 question. “the money’s got to come from somewhere,” cornyn said. “that’s one of the things we’ll have to explore if (house republicans) want to make some changes.” trump has already signaled flexibility on the corporate tax rate, saying on saturday that it could end up at 22 percent rather than 20 percent in both bills. his comments could help justify a bump up in corporate taxes to cover the cost of eliminating the corporate amt. but republicans worry that increasing the corporate income tax rate above 20 percent could make the u.s. economy less attractive in a global marketplace where national tax rates have fallen. “i would hope that we would not change the corporate rate,” cornyn said. “i hope we don’t undermine our own message.”  ",0
" russian property developer sergei polonsky, who has been convicted of defrauding investors, plans to run in next year s presidential election, his campaign manager said on wednesday. polonsky is one of russia s most flamboyant tycoons, known for once eating his tie after losing a wager and for pouring scorn on anyone worth less than a billion dollars. he is a divisive figure, with many russians viewing him as a symbol of capitalist excess.  russian president vladimir putin is the strong favorite to win the election, opinion polls show, though he has yet to announce his intention to run. maxim shingarkin, a former member of the russian parliament, said he had signed up to be polonsky s campaign manager.   sergei polonsky has confirmed that he is running for president of russia,  shingarkin said in a twitter post.  i can promise a bone rattling election campaign.   russian news media quoted polonsky as saying he was planning a presidential bid. in july a moscow court found him guilty of fraud but allowed him to walk free, saying that too much time had elapsed since the crime for the sentence to have legal force. he had spent two years in detention in moscow awaiting trial. it was not immediately clear if polonsky s conviction would disqualify him from running for the presidency.   other people planning to run in the presidential election in march next year are television personality ksenia sobchak, whose late father was putin s boss in the early 1990s, and journalist ekaterina gordon.

" pyongyang university of science and technology (pust), north korea s only western funded university, will start the fall semester without its dozens of american staff after failing to secure exemptions to a u.s. travel ban that starts on friday.  pust   home to the largest concentration of foreigners in the reclusive state   plans to revise courses and teaching schedules but its largely english based curriculum will be heavily impacted, two sources familiar with pust s operations said. pust was founded in 2010 by a korean american evangelical christian with the goal of helping north korea's future elite learn the skills to modernize the isolated country and engage with the outside world. (graphic: americans detained in north korea   tmsnrt.rs/2pme3ks) in mid july, however, the u.s. state department announced a ban on americans traveling to north korea following the death earlier this year of an american student who had been detained by the state while on a tour. it advised u.s. citizens living there to leave. since then, tensions on the korean peninsula have escalated significantly. nuclear armed north korea has undertaken a number of provocative missile tests, including two intercontinental ballistic missile launches and one medium range missile test this week that flew over japan. of the roughly 130 foreigners at pust including faculty members, staffers and family members, about 60 were u.s. citizens, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. none had received special permission to stay and all have now left pyongyang.  the teaching activities and the unique  international english based  character of the school are severely impacted by the u.s. travel ban and the decision of some other personnel not to return,  the source said.  the school, which is open about its christian affiliation, has already been rocked by the detention of two of its staff members by the north korean regime this year. the two were accused of acting against the interests of the state. u.s. officials announced the ban six weeks ago due to the risk americans will be held for  long term detention  in the country. the ban was imposed after u.s. student otto warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a tour last year.  warmbier fell into a coma in custody and died soon after he was released to u.s. officials. the circumstances surrounding his death are not clear. the last major tour involving u.s. tourists flew out of north korea on thursday. the ban, similar to previous u.s. restrictions on travel to iraq and libya, makes north korea the only country in the world americans are currently banned by the state department from visiting. journalists and humanitarian workers can apply for special permission. but the u.s. government has yet to issue guidelines on how to obtain waivers, leaving pust and educators uncertain how or when it might be possible to apply for exemptions, according to the people familiar with pust s operations. the state department said it was unable to comment on specific requests for exemptions.  over the past several weeks, pust leaders have tried to lobby for exemptions so that their work can continue, the sources said. the school is involved in ongoing discussions with u.s. officials, they added. the university was seen as a rare experiment in academic diplomacy with a country increasingly entirely isolated from the rest of the world due to tightening sanctions over its defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons programs. u.s. president donald trump has vowed to stop pyongyang achieving its goal of being able to fire a nuclear warhead to the united states and has warned the u.s. military is  locked and loaded  in case of north korean provocation. since pust took in its first 50 students in 2010, the school has grown to about 500 undergraduate and 60 graduate students studying in mostly three departments   electronic and computer engineering, international finance and management and agriculture and life sciences.   a lot of effort has been spent over the past seven years that pust has been operating. the prospect of this progress being undermined   even totally thwarted   as a consequence of the u.s. government action, is deeply worrying to everyone involved,  one of the sources said.

" the u.n. peacekeeping mission in congo on monday condemned the arrest of about 30 opposition members amid a crackdown on dissent by president joseph kabila s government.  the arrests occurred in the southeastern city of lubumbashi on sunday when police broke up a meeting by the union for democracy and social progress (udps) party on the eve of a return to the city of opposition leader felix tshisekedi, party members told reuters.     such security incidents are threatening to spiral out of control in africa s largest copper producer because of kabila s refusal to hold elections when his presidential mandate expired nearly a year ago.  from now, we no longer consider joseph kabila as president,  tshisekedi told journalists on monday in lubumbashi, where a planned rally was banned by the government. he is usually in the capital, or in europe.  congo s government has banned opposition demonstrations since last year, when security forces killed dozens of protesters demanding kabila s departure.    the election commission said this month that an election to replace kabila, who came to power after his father s assassination in 2001, would not be possible before april 2019 at the earliest   raising the prospect of long term unrest.  i urge the congolese authorities to release immediately and unconditionally those arbitrarily arrested yesterday in lubumbashi,  said maman sidikou, head of the u.n. monusco peacekeeping mission. monusco also demanded an end to restrictions imposed on kyungu wa kumwanza, president of the national union of federalists of the congo (unafec) party, who has been under de facto house arrest for several months without being charged with a crime. in another sign of discontent with election delays, the union for the congolese nation(unc)opposition party said in a statement on monday it was withdrawing its representative in a power sharing government, budget minister pierre kangudia. the latter could not immediately be reached for comment. kabila s political opponents are weak and divided. many joined a power sharing government earlier this year following the death of opposition figure, etienne tshisekedi, felix s father, and they enjoy limited credibility with the population.  however, an economic crisis that has seen inflation spike to over 50 percent, increased militia activity, and a series of prison breaks have highlighted kabila s tenuous hold on power.

" kathryn stellmack expects the world from donald trump. after listening to his speeches and casting her vote for him, she expects trump to toughen immigration laws, restore lost jobs, upend a corrupt political system, build a wall on the border, and be, as the millionaire put it, the “greatest jobs president that god has ever created.” “we expect him to move forward on all the items he has promised to move forward on,” said stellmack, 69, a retiree in west palm beach, florida. “and if he doesn’t, we will hold his feet to the fire.” after a presidential race fueled by brash but constantly shifting policy proposals, trump’s millions of followers — from social conservative activists to struggling blue collar workers to hardline militant groups — say if he does anything less than take a wrecking ball to business as usual washington, they will be disappointed. “we’ll be watching, mr. trump,” said stellmack. trump’s promises have been hard to pin down, with many policy details left elusive and vague. nbc news identified 141 “distinct shifts” on 23 major issues since trump announced his candidacy on june 16, 2015.  still, his fiery rhetoric had an unmistakable message of ending big government and the entrenched power of establishment elites in both parties. that inspired hope that trump can break through washington’s gridlock to make progress on plans to invigorate the economy, eliminate terrorist threats, rip up trade agreements and repeal president barack obama’s healthcare plan known as obamacare. “i totally trust him,” said laura czarniak, 56, of manistee, michigan, a rust belt state that leans democrat in presidential elections but which flipped to trump on tuesday.  “i know he’ll build the wall. i know he’ll take care of the syrian refugee problem. i know he’ll get rid of obamacare. there is not a chance in hell he won’t do those things,” she said. but even with republicans retaining control of congress, trump will have to accept limits and compromises on some of his plans. many republicans, for example, are wary of his proposals to scrap trade deals and boost spending on infrastructure improvements. some of his plans have already been rolled back. trump faces his highest expectations on the issue of immigration, given his intense focus on attention grabbing campaign proposals like forcing mexico to pay for a border wall, and temporarily banning muslims from entering the country. but he recently indicated he would at first deport only criminal undocumented immigrants, after previously pledging to deport all undocumented aliens, while the muslim ban has softened into “extreme vetting” of immigrants from some countries. he told the wall street journal in an interview on friday that he would consider keeping parts of obamacare intact — easing off his calls for a total repeal — after obama spoke to him on the issue at the white house on thursday. mark morris, a leader of the colorado based three percent united patriots militia group, said he understood trump would need time on some issues, but he expected quick movement on repealing obamacare and appointing a conservative supreme court justice to fill the seat of the late antonin scalia. he said he hoped trump would stand with ranchers in their disputes with the federal government over fees charged for cattle grazing on public land – a call to arms for many in the patriot and militia movement. morris warned trump should not count on his followers to stay with him if he did not produce results. “people voted with a lot of faith that he will come through,” he said. “i don’t think it is going to work out very well if he doesn’t get the things done and he comes back at the end of four years and says i need four more years to accomplish what i need to accomplish.” trump had to take strong action on immigration given his rhetoric, said roy beck, head of numbers usa, a group that favors reduced immigration levels. he said numbers usa and other grassroots groups would pressure trump to keep his promises to bolster enforcement and cut back on legal immigration and foreign workers, including eliminating immigration by low skill and non extraordinary skilled workers. “there’s no way he would have been elected president if he had not so boldly made immigration his top issue,” beck said. “you have to come through on your top issue. the question is in the details.” he said many trump supporters understood his talk about the border wall was “shorthand” for restoring the rule of law in immigration, although it was a promise by which he would be judged. “we’re in the best position we’ve ever been in since the 1950s to get control of this issue, but we still have big challenges,” beck said. for many activists in the anti abortion movement who are suspicious trump’s promises are fueled by politics more than conviction, he still has plenty to prove. “i think we’re seeing a mix of emotions, from excitement and some fear to somewhere in between,” jeanne mancini, president of the anti abortion group march for life education and defense fund said of trump’s election. “for us the most important thing will be to hold him to his campaign promises, particularly on the supreme court. we want to be sure he is true to his word,” she said of trump’s vow to appoint justices who will vote to overturn roe vs wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion. but trump needs to move quickly, said thomas pyle, a trump supporter and president of the free market advocacy group american energy alliance. “washington is a very, very difficult place to turn the ship. he has a limited window before the culture in washington seeps in,” pyle said. “but if he acts boldly, he can do a lot.” ",0
" president elect donald trump is finding himself caught between his desire to improve relations with russia and fellow republicans who are pushing for a harsher response to what american spy agencies say was the kremlin’s meddling in the u.s. presidential election. the tacit acknowledgement on sunday by his incoming chief of staff, reince priebus, that russia was behind the hacking of democratic party organizations suggests that trump’s maneuvering room could be shrinking. trump has long been dismissive of the u.s. intelligence conclusion that russia was behind the election hacks, which russia has denied, or was trying to help him win the november ballot, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by china or a 400 pound hacker sitting on his bed. but following a report from u.s. intelligence agencies last week blaming russian president vladimir putin, russia experts say trump will face growing calls for a stiff military, diplomatic, economic, and perhaps also covert response after his jan. 20 inauguration.  “the new u.s. administration will need to adopt a significantly tougher line,” said nile gardiner of the heritage foundation, a conservative think tank in washington that is an influential voice in trump’s transition team.     republicans in congress wary of trump’s push for detente with putin could pressure the new president to withhold the thing the russian leader wants most: a rapid easing of the economic sanctions imposed after russia’s 2014 annexation of ukraine’s crimea and its support for separatists in eastern ukraine, the russia experts said. u.s. intelligence agencies say that since the election, russian spies have turned to hacking other individuals and organizations, including prominent think tanks, in what analysts think is an effort to gain insights into future u.s. policies. washington’s brookings institution, which is headed by prominent russia expert strobe talbott, “received a big wave of attacks the day after the election,” but there is no reason to believe its systems have been compromised, said david nassar, the think tank’s vice president for communications.  republican senator lindsey graham said he and fellow republican john mccain, the chairman of the senate armed services committee, would introduce legislation with stronger sanctions than the ones now in place. “we’re going to introduce sanctions that ... will hit them in the financial sector and the energy sector, where they’re the weakest,” graham told nbc television’s meet the press. retired marine general james mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense who will face a senate confirmation hearing on thursday, is expected to advocate a stronger line against moscow than the one trump outlined during his election campaign.that could put him at odds with trump’s national security adviser, retired army lieutenant general michael flynn, who has had warmer relations with putin’s government, and with rex tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, who as ceo of exxonmobil had extensive business ties with russia. if mattis does push for a tougher approach to russia, that could empower u.s. advocates for strengthening the american military presence in europe. that could include reinforcing u.s. troops in the baltic states and poland, analysts say. nato already plans to deploy 4,000 additional troops, planes, tanks and artillery to the three former soviet republics in the baltics and poland this year. “there is nervousness about trump among europeans at nato,” said one european diplomat. “any grand bargain with russia would fundamentally change nato’s course and threaten europe with disunity,” the diplomat said. “but we don’t expect that. nato is seeking to reassure baltic allies, and the united states is a big part of the deterrent.”  some advocates of a sterner response to the russian hacking say it should include cyber counterattacks, perhaps by leaking financial information embarrassing to some of putin’s aides and close associates. so far, the obama administration has refrained from such action, at least publicly, for fear that it could lead to an escalating cyberwar that could threaten critical infrastructure such as financial transactions and energy transmission. although trump has said the nation needed to “move on to bigger and better things” following the u.s. disclosure of alleged russian hacking, it appears that republican and democratic lawmakers are unlikely to drop the issue anytime soon. mccain told nbc he wanted to create a select committee to investigate the russian hacking, if he can convince the republican controlled senate’s leaders to charge their minds.  in the meantime, he said, key senate committees, including armed services and intelligence, will investigate. experts say the close scrutiny of russia’s actions will come just as trump’s administration starts to craft a comprehensive strategy on the former cold war foe. it is likely to be weeks or longer before a clear sense of trump’s actual russia strategy comes into view. “until there’s a team in place, until there’s a little more organization … i tend to think we’re not going to have clear answers,” said heather conley, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for europe now at the center for strategic and international studies.

" maine voters have made the state the eighth in the united states to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, state officials said on wednesday, following a recount of votes on a ballot initiative. the measure passed by 3,995 votes with the support of 381,768 people, maine secretary of state matthew dunlap said in a statement. that was a slightly narrower margin of victory than the 4,073 vote gap reported following the nov. 8 election. the measure now goes to governor paul lepage, who has 10 days under maine law to issue a proclamation of the vote results. it would take effect 30 days later, setting the stage for the drug to become legal for adults over 21 beginning late next month. the result makes maine the second state in the northeast to legalize recreational use of the drug, as voters in nearby massachusetts approved a similar measure last month. marijuana became legal to use and posses in limited quantities, but not yet to buy, in that state last week. lepage, a republican, said earlier this week during a radio interview that he intended to seek legal advice before signing the proclamation, since the drug remains illegal under federal law. president elect donald trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has sent mixed signals about his views on it. during the campaign, trump, a republican, said that marijuana legalization was best left to the states. his pick for attorney general, u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, has criticized democratic president barack obama’s administration for not enforcing the federal ban aggressively enough. an october opinion poll by gallup showed that 60 percent of americans now support the legalization of recreational use of marijuana. even more approve of the idea of legalizing marijuana for medical use, a step that 28 states have taken. in addition to maine and massachusetts, voters in colorado, washington, alaska, oregon, california, nevada and the district of columbia have legalized recreational use of the drug.

" david nason, a general electric executive and former treasury department official, is the front runner to become the federal reserve’s top wall street regulator under president elect donald trump, sources familiar with the screening said on thursday. nason leads ge’s energy financial services division, which funds worldwide energy development, mostly from thermal and renewable sources. in 2008, nason was a deputy to treasury secretary henry paulson as u.s. regulators tried to stabilize wall street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed. trump will have a chance to nominate the fed’s vice chair for supervision   a role conceived in the wake of the financial collapse to watchdog wall street. if nason is tapped for the role, he would be the most senior rule writer for wall street with a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day. in recent weeks, other names have been floated as vice chair candidates who can boast support from wall street. representative french hill, an arkansas republican and former banker, has been favored by some in the banking industry while some washington lobbyists have favored paul atkins, a former commissioner with the securities and exchange commission. while no final decision has been made on who should fill the job, nason has paulson’s backing and has become the front runner in recent weeks, the sources said. in the last several weeks, nason has met with trump’s senior economic advisers gary cohn and steve mnuchin, according to one source familiar with the meetings. a trump spokesperson declined to comment. trump has named cohn as head of the white house national economic council and nominated mnuchin as treasury secretary. both cohn and mnuchin held senior roles at goldman sachs, and they have heard directly from paulson, the company’s former chief executive, that nason is a solid pick, according to another source familiar with the screening. nason did not immediately respond to a call for comment. a spokesman for paulson declined to comment. in paulson’s memoir, “on the brink,” the former cabinet secretary singles nason out for praise during the financial crisis.

" immigration and climate policy are the most contentious issues in exploratory negotiations between three parties seeking to form germany s next government, chancellor angela merkel said on monday, adding that she wants proper talks to start in 10 days. despite weeks of exploratory discussion, merkel s conservatives, the pro business free democrats (fdp) and the greens remain far apart on climate, immigration and energy policy, and they disagree on where the blame lies for the lack of progress.  for me it is clear that on the subject of finances the question is how we can use the room for maneuver (in the budget) so that everybody can have their priorities implemented while at the same time ensure that we have a balanced budget,  merkel said in a video message on facebook.  on the subject of climate protection, challenging goals for 2020 that we undertook as federal government under my leadership are not so simple to meet,  she added, shortly before a meeting with other party leaders to try to nudge the talks forward.  the theme that is especially important for us is the issue of immigration and integration,  she said.  these will be difficult issues.  party leaders are hoping for a sharper focus on policy detail to reinvigorate negotiations that have barely inched forward since a national election in september. merkel said she wanted the exploratory talks to end on nov. 16 after which the parties can launch proper negotiations that can conclude with a coalition agreement. the fdp and greens blame each other for the lack of real progress.  by dragging their foot on climate protection, the fdp are playing into the hands of climate change deniers like (u.s. president donald) trump,  greens party chair simone peter told a news conference.  the lack of seriousness has to stop.  but greens co leader cem oezdemir signaled in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung that the ecologist party would be ready to relent on its insistence that the next government commit to removing all combustion engines from roads by 2030.  it s clear to me that we alone would not be able to insist that 2030 will be the year when combustion engines are no longer,  he said. the greens wanted instead a  clear commitment  that the cars of the future are emissions free, he added. fdp leader christian lindner said the hard work of finding common ground was only now beginning.  there haven t been attempts to build bridges in the past two weeks because that wasn t the purpose,  he said.  we look forward in this phase to moving from outlines to the facts and goals that need to be harmonized   or not, as the case may be.  senior greens complain that talks have been hamstrung by the fdp s lack of preparedness. after a four year absence from the federal parliament, the fdp lacks the policy expertise needed to negotiate the compromises that are needed, green officials say. but lindner said he opposed the greens  desire to  make an example of industrial germany  by forcing it to meet expensive and constraining climate protection targets, and he suggested germany could have a greater impact on the climate by helping other countries to improve their emissions record. for merkel, the awkward three way negotiations, forced on her after her conservative bloc shed votes in the election, represents her best chance of securing a fourth term in office, with many believing failure would oblige her to stand aside. with her former coalition partners, the social democrats (spd), determined to go into opposition after a disastrous election, germany could face a lengthy period of drift at a time when many in europe look to berlin for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to trans atlantic ties.

" u.s. attorney general jeff sessions stepped up the trump administration’s critique of so called sanctuary cities on tuesday, saying local and state policies to limit cooperation with immigration enforcement are a criminal’s “best friend.”  sessions’ remarks, at a gathering of law enforcement authorities in portland, oregon, came days after repudiation of his stance against the sanctuary movement in separate actions by a federal judge in chicago and the california legislature. the judge in chicago on friday barred the justice department from withholding public safety grants to cities unless they allowed u.s. immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provided 48 hours’ notice before releasing individuals sought for deportation. on saturday, california lawmakers voted to make california a sanctuary state, approving a bill barring local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail just to allow immigration agents to take them into their custody. but under a compromise negotiated with governor jerry brown, the bill allows local police to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. it also allows immigration agents access to local jails. sessions called on local jurisdictions that have sought to shield illegal immigrants from deportation efforts to reconsider, and he urged brown not to sign the california bill into law. president donald trump and his administration have insisted that the deportation crackdown is aimed at illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes, and that sanctuary measures contribute to rising crime. “such policies undermine the moral authority of law and undermine the safety of the jurisdictions that adopt them,” sessions said. “that makes a sanctuary city a trafficker, smuggler or gang member’s best friend.” he cited cases in oregon and california in which illegal immigrants were charged with committing violent crimes after being arrested for relatively minor offenses by local police and then released, despite federal requests to keep them in custody. sanctuary supporters counter that enlisting police cooperation in deportation actions undermines community trust in local law enforcement, particularly among latinos, and they  question whether trump is really targeting dangerous criminals. “we’re not soldiers of donald trump or the federal immigration service,” brown said in a cnn interview on tuesday. he called the measure passed by california’s legislature “a well balanced bill.” portland mayor ted wheeler said in a letter to sessions that oregon state law dating back to 1987 prohibits state and local police from enforcing federal immigration law.

" a prominent chinese general under investigation for corruption has committed suicide, state media said on tuesday, the latest development in a sweeping anti graft campaign that has shaken the armed forces. zhang yang, a former member of the powerful central military commission (cmc), was being investigated over links to disgraced generals guo boxiong and xu caihou, the official xinhua news agency said. the investigation into zhang, 66, had verified that he  gravely violated discipline , was  suspected of giving and taking bribes  and the origin of a huge amount of assets was unclear, xinhua said, citing the commission.  on the afternoon of nov. 23, zhang yang hanged himself at home,  the agency said. a suicide by an officer who held such a senior post is rare, though experts have said the frequency of officials from various levels of government taking their own lives may have increased as a result of the intensity of the corruption crackdown since president xi jinping took power five years ago. a commentary carried on both the defense ministry and military s official websites said the cmc decided on aug. 28 to investigate zhang, who had  lost his moral bottom line  and used suicide as a means to  escape punishment from the party and country , an  extremely abominable act .  this former general of high position and great power used this shameful way to end his own life,  the commentary said.  he would exhort loyalty but be corrupt behind others  backs, a typical  two faced person ,  it said. sources had told reuters that zhang, who had served as director of the military s political work department, had been subject to an investigation, but the government had not announced it. zhang s downfall was foreshadowed in september when he failed to make a list of 303 military delegates to the ruling communist party s key five yearly congress, along with fellow cmc member fang fenghui. both men were replaced at the congress, held last month, as part of a sweeping military leadership reshuffle in which xi install trusted allies in key positions. china s military, the world s largest and undergoing an ambitious modernization campaign, has been an important focus of xi s deep seated fight against corruption. serving and retired officers have said graft in the armed forces is so pervasive it could undermine china s ability to wage war. dozens of officers have been investigated and jailed, including xu and guo, both former vice chairmen of the commission, which xi heads. xu once ran the political work department, which is in charge of imbuing political thought and makes military personnel decisions, and along with guo was accused of taking bribes in exchange for promotions. guo was jailed for life last year. xu died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial.

" at least six people were wounded on friday when a bomb went off along railway tracks in southwestern pakistan, halting train service in the region, security and railways officials said.  the train was traveling from baluchistan s capital of quetta to the eastern metropolis of lahore when a blast on the main railway track damaged one of its cars.  one train bogie was damaged in the blast and a portion of the tracks blown up,  said railways official aammir baloch, adding that quetta s train services had been suspended. security officials said six passengers were injured in the blast.  the taliban, sunni islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al qaeda and the islamic state group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders iran and afghanistan. baluchistan is at the center of infrastructure projects that form part of china s  belt and road  initiative, which has brought $57 billion of investment to pakistan. violence in the southwestern region has fueled concern about security for a transport and energy link planned to run from western china to pakistan s southern deepwater port of gwadar. separatists in baluchistan, who have long battled the state for a greater share of the resources of the gas  and mineral rich region, also accuse the central government of discrimination. separately, two workers of a prominent political party were killed on friday in a landmine blast in the district of harnai  near quetta as they traveled to a party meeting.  the victims were brothers and belonged to the awami national party,  regional official abdul salam achakzai told reuters.   the explosive device was planted by the road,  he added.

" the white house domestic policy council (dpc) is taking the lead on a decision about how many refugees to admit to the united states next year, two current and three former officials said, a move that may empower those who wish to reduce immigration. the council, which reports to u.s. president donald trump’s senior adviser for policy stephen miller, an architect of trump’s initial travel ban, is adopting a role traditionally handled by national security council and state department officials. the shift may strengthen the hand of officials who, like trump himself, wish to cut the number of refugees resettled in the united states, against foreign policy experts who view the issue through an international humanitarian lens and say taking them in is vital to getting others to keep their borders open. the bureaucratic maneuver appears to be part of a wider washington fight over steps that the trump administration has taken to limit immigration to the united states. these include two trump executive orders, both challenged in court, temporarily banning most refugees from entering as well as most visits by citizens of six muslim majority nations; an internal debate over the cost of resettling refugees; and a crackdown on illegal immigration. by law, the president must tell congress before the oct. 1 start of the fiscal year how many refugees he believes need to be resettled in the united states in the next year. it is not known how many refugees trump will decide to admit. the dpc’s enhanced role may reflect a white house tendency to view the issue through a political prism given trump’s focus in his 2016 election campaign on curbing immigration and its popularity with his base, the current and former officials said. “they see it as continuation of a campaign issue about keeping america safe” rather than as “a humanitarian issue about helping people who were fleeing persecution and war overseas,” said one former official who spoke on condition of anonymity. in his original jan. 27 executive order, trump said some people admitted as refugees “have been convicted or implicated in terrorism related crimes” and called for tighter vetting. “deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter,” he added.     critics argue refugees are the most heavily vetted group to come to the united states and highly unlikely to pose a threat. the white house and state department did not respond to requests for comment. miller was the keynote speaker at a 2015 awards ceremony of the center for immigration studies, a group which aims to limit immigration. dpc member john zadrozny has worked for the federation for american immigration reform, which seeks to lower immigration to a level that “more closely reflects past policy.” in both his travel ban executive orders, trump has ordered the united states to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal 2017 year ending sept. 30, less than half the 110,000 president barack obama authorized. that would be the lowest level of refugee resettlement in the united states since fiscal 2007, when 48,282 were admitted. as of july 21, the united states had taken in 50,334 so far in fiscal 2017, according to official data. (for a graphic of u.s. refugee admissions see: tmsnrt.rs/2h0pqrc) however, it would track with the original guideline set by the refugee act of 1980, which capped admissions at 50,000 for fiscal 1980, 1981 and 1982 unless the president found more were justified on humanitarian or other national interest grounds. from fiscal 1983, the 50,000 cap did not apply. proponents argue that the united states needs to take in refugees for many reasons, not least to help make the case to states such as jordan, turkey and lebanon accepting hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees to keep their borders open. “there has been so much talk recently of the alleged security implications of letting refugees in, but the administration doesn’t seem fully cognizant of the national security implications of keeping refugees out,” said rebecca heller of the international refugee assistance project, which sued to block trump’s travel ban executive orders. “our allies in the middle east, on whom we depend in the partnership to defeat (the islamic state group), rely on u.s. refugee resettlement to relieve the strain placed by refugees on their domestic infrastructure,” she added.

" a women s rights group has called a rally to protest against a portuguese court ruling that upheld a light sentence for a woman s attackers on the grounds they may have been driven to it by her adultery, an offence punishable with death in the bible.  judges neto de moura and maria luisa arantes rejected the prosecutors  appeal to toughen the suspended sentence and fine, saying the  depressive state  of the two defendants   the woman s former husband and her former lover   was a mitigating factor.     we read in the bible that an adulteress should be punished with death,  the judges in the porto court of appeal wrote. they also referenced the  symbolic sentences  given to men who murdered adulterous wives in the late 19th century in portugal.  these references are merely intended to stress that the society has always strongly condemned adultery by a woman and therefore sees the violence by a betrayed, humiliated man with some understanding,  they wrote in their oct. 11 verdict. the umar women s union for alternative and response called the verdict in portugal s second largest city  revolting  and said it perpetuated  the ideology of victim blaming .   evoking the bible does not combine with the rule of law in our country and discredits the judicial norms,  umar said in a statement. in the 2015 attack, one of the men assaulted and held the victim while the other attacked her with a nail spiked club. her injuries were not life threatening. both were convicted and sentenced to pay large fines in addition to suspended time in prison of about a year each. umar and the feminist movement por todas nos (for all of us women) called a protest rally in downtown lisbon for friday. protests were also called in porto under the slogan  male chauvinism is not justice, but crime . ultra orthodox patriarchy   one of the cornerstones of the fascist dictatorship of antonio salazar up until the 1974 revolution   still survives in parts of portugal.

" president barack obama said on thursday that his departure from office in january might be what it takes to begin to heal the political scars over obamacare and allow for needed fixes to his signature healthcare law. the 2010 affordable care act tipped off a long and bitter political and legal battle between the white house and republicans in the u.s. congress who said the 2010 law creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. republicans have been quick to highlight a recent barrage of negative headlines about rising health insurance premiums and shrinking doctor networks for people participating in subsidized insurance plans offered under the law. obama acknowledged the law is not working perfectly, but said the problems could be fixed by legislation, encouraging lawmakers to create a government run health insurance option to help u.s. states where there is little or no competition among private insurers. “maybe now that i’m leaving office, maybe republicans can stop with the 60 something repeal votes they’ve taken and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative ... and just work with the next president to smooth out the kinks,” he said in a speech at miami dade college. “they can even change the name of the law to reagancare, or paul ryan care,” obama said, evoking the name of the republican speaker of the house of representatives. “i don’t care. i just want it to work.” but ryan, in a written response, said he would continue to seek to repeal and replace the law. “at this point, one thing is clear: this law can’t be fixed,” ryan said. obama was later slated to headline a rally in florida, a battleground election state, for hillary clinton, the democratic candidate in the nov. 8 presidential election. clinton has said she would add a public option and expand tax incentives for healthcare costs. republican nominee donald trump has pledged to repeal and replace the law. the government forecasts 13.8 million people will sign up for obamacare plans in 2017, up 1.1 million from 2016. there are 10.7 million uninsured people who are eligible for the exchanges but have not enrolled, and about 40 percent of those are young, health and human services secretary sylvia burwell said on wednesday. obama said that nationwide, not enough young and healthy people have signed up to provide a revenue stream that offsets the costs of covering members with serious illnesses. as a result, several big insurers, including unitedhealth group inc (unh.n), aetna inc (aet.n) and humana inc (hum.n), are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger than expected financial losses. monthly premium prices have climbed, which further discourages some people from signing up. “next year will tell whether those are growing pains, or they are more serious issues,” drew altman, chief executive of the kaiser family foundation, said in an interview. analysis conducted by the nonpartisan foundation suggests at least 16 million people need to enroll before the online obamacare insurance marketplaces stabilize. obama said expanding insurance coverage for millions of people and reforming the healthcare system was a key reason he ran for office. he said he gets letters from americans every day thanking him for the difference it has made in their lives. the law cut the number of uninsured americans from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2015. much of the decline is due to the law’s provision allowing states to expand medicaid health coverage for the poor. the law also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to americans for existing medical problems, and allowed parents to keep children insured on their health plans until age 26. some health policy experts on both the political left and right say congress may be more receptive to bipartisan efforts to fix the affordable care act after obama leaves office. some republican governors who refused to expand medicaid may also be more willing to do so after the election   a change that would expand coverage for about 4 million people. “i think the piece of obamacare that people don’t like is obama,” kathleen sebelius, obama’s former health and human services secretary, who oversaw the program’s launch, said in an interview. “this has become a very personal battle about this president, which is i think really unfortunate.” ",0
" switzerland is sending a tunisian couple who include the brother of a man presumed to have killed two people in a knife attack at a french train station back to their home country for security reasons, swiss federal police said on tuesday. the couple were arrested in the swiss town of chiasso near the swiss italian border on sunday night where they sought asylum. they will detained pending their expulsion, swiss federal police said, giving no date.  the man is known to foreign police services for his links with the jihadist terrorist movement. for now his role in the marseille attack, if any, is not clear,  swiss federal police said in a statement giving no names or ages for the couple. earlier a source close to the investigation said on tuesday that swiss had detained two tunisians wanted in connection with a deadly knife attack at marseille train station on oct. 1. swiss police confirmed that one of the two detained is a brother of 29 year old ahmed hannachi, who was shot dead by a french soldier after killing two young women outside the station in southern france. authorities are investigating the attack as a  probable  terrorist act.  hannachi s younger brother, anis, was arrested in italy earlier this month. more than 240 people have been killed in france since 2015 in attacks by assailants who pledged allegiance to, or said they were inspired by, the islamic state group. earlier this month, the french parliament adopted counter terrorism legislation to increase police surveillance powers and make it easier to close mosques suspected of preaching hatred   a law which civil rights groups said would infringe on personal freedoms.

" democrat hillary clinton’s campaign laid out states critical to the u.s. presidential election in a memo to supporters dated wednesday, including six with key minority populations   ohio, north carolina, virginia, florida, colorado and nevada. the memo, sent to “interested parties” from clinton campaign manager robby mook, also set a goal of raking in $4 million a day between now and the nov. 8 election, or around $500 million total. the memo, which was shared with reuters by a clinton supporter, emphasized the importance of boosting turnout among minority voters in the race against presumptive republican nominee donald trump. “if we fail to turn out african american voters in ohio, north carolina or virginia, we will lose. if we fail to turn out hispanic voters in florida, colorado or nevada, we will lose,” mook wrote.   “if we fail to turn out asian american and pacific islander voters in nevada or virginia, we will lose. plain and simple,” he added. the memo emphasized the need for “the most aggressive get out the vote (gotv) program in history” across the country and named other states, such as pennsylvania and ohio, as key to the campaign’s efforts. the campaign declined to comment. clinton’s lead over trump widened to 13 percentage points in a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on tuesday. the poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supporting clinton, with 33 percent backing trump. but 22 percent said they would not support either candidate. that support is lopsided among different racial and ethnic groups. among the smaller sample of black voters, for example, clinton has a whopping 80 percent support, while with white voters the two candidates are just about even, according to the poll.

" suspected militants from the somali group al shabaab beheaded four men in two different attacks in lamu county on kenya s north coast on wednesday, authorities said, a month after 12 people were killed in similar incidents in the region.  lamu county commissioner gilbert kitiyo said the attacks took place in silini mashambani early on wednesday where three were killed, while in a separate incident in bobo village one person was killed.  kitiyo said about 30 heavily armed assailants went from house to house calling out victims by name before pulling some out and slitting their throats.  they were dressed in military gear and had ak 47 rifles. they beheaded four men before fleeing into the forest. all the victims are men. police have already arrived at the scene and taken the bodies to the mortuary,  kitiyo told reuters by telephone. he said the attackers surrounded all the victims  houses  making it difficult for them to escape. abdiasis abu musab, al shabaab s spokesman for military operations, said the group was behind the attack, and put the number of those killed at five, saying it had targeted non muslims. in august, al shabaab attackers killed four men in a similar manner while earlier in july, nine men were slaughtered the same way in nearby villages. after the latest attacks, protesters burned tyres on the roads on wednesday morning in complaint over insecurity. riot police to fire teargas and rubber bullets to disperse them.  a government imposed dusk to dawn curfew is in force in the area following past attacks. the al qaeda linked al shabaab aims to topple somalia s united nations backed government and impose its own strict interpretation of islam. they have intensified attacks in kenya since it sent troops into somalia in 2011. they have also claimed responsibility for a series of cross border attacks in recent months, including a spate of roadside bombings targeting security forces.

" president barack obama said on tuesday he is hearing from  foreign leaders who are alarmed at republican presidential candidates’ positions on issues such as climate change and immigration.     “i think foreign observers are troubled by some of the rhetoric that’s been taking place in these republican primaries and republican debates,” obama told reporters at the end of a summit with southeast asian leaders. americans will choose a new president in a nov. 8 election. republicans and democrats are currently battling in nominating contests to determine who will represent their parties in the race for the presidency. republican presidential front runner donald trump has made headlines for supporting a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and controversial statements about immigrants. but obama said the concern abroad is not limited to trump.  “he may up the ante in anti muslim sentiment, but if you look at what other republican candidates have said, that’s pretty troubling too,” obama added. noting that other countries rely on the united states to back sound science, obama also took aim at republican resistance to strong action on climate change as “troubling to the international community.” obama reiterated his confidence that ultimately americans would reject billionaire trump. americans realize the next president will have access to the nuclear codes, have the power to send u.s. troops to war and may be tasked with keeping the banking system afloat, obama said. “they recognize that being president is a serious job. it’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. it’s not promotion or marketing,” he said. “the american people are sensible, and i think they will make a sensible choice in the end.”  trump, a real estate mogul, was host of popular reality tv shows “the apprentice” and “the celebrity apprentice” before making his run for president. asked about obama’s comments at a town hall style event in beaufort, south carolina, trump said obama had done a “lousy job” and would have been a one term president if he had decided to challenge him in the last election. “this man has done such a bad job and set us back so far and for him to say that actually is a great compliment,” trump said.

" myanmar s government said on wednesday that police had arrested two reuters journalists, wa lone and kyaw soe oo. the reporters had been working on stories about a military crackdown on the rohingya muslim minority in rahkine state that has caused almost 650,000 people to flee to neighboring bangladesh. the ministry of information said in a statement on its facebook page that the journalists and two policemen face charges under the british colonial era official secrets act. the 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  said the statement, which was accompanied by a photo of the pair in handcuffs.  it said they were detained at a police station on the outskirts of yangon, the southeast asian nation s main city. wa lone and kyaw soe oo went missing on tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. reuters  driver myothant tun dropped them off at battalion 8 s compound at around 8 pm and the two reporters and two police officers headed to a nearby restaurant. the journalists did not  return to the car. the rohingya refugees in bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly buddhist nation was triggered by a military counter offensive in rakhine state that the united nations has branded  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  reuters reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo have been reporting on events of global importance in myanmar, and we learned today that they have been arrested in connection with their work,  said stephen j. adler, president and editor in chief of reuters.  we are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom.  we call for authorities to release them immediately,  he said. a spokesman for myanmar leader aung san suu kyi confirmed that the two journalists had been arrested.  not only your reporters, but also the policemen who were involved in that case,  spokesman zaw htay said.  we will take action against those policemen and also the reporters.  in washington, state department spokeswoman heather nauert emphasized that the agency was  following this closely.  she said that u.s. ambassador scot marciel on wednesday had a conversation with two government officials in myanmar who seemed  genuinely unaware  of the situation.   we care about the safety and security of international reporters who are simply just trying to do their jobs. so we re going to continue to try to stay on that,  nauert said.  the u.s. embassy in yangon said in a statement posted on its website on wednesday it was  deeply concerned by the highly irregular arrests of two reuters reporters after they were invited to meet with police officials in yangon last night .  for a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,  the embassy said.  we urge the government to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the journalists.   the european union s mission in yangon also voiced concern.  the eu delegation is closely following their case and we call on the myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights,  it said in a statement.  media freedom is the foundation of any democracy.  the new york based committee to protect journalists called for the reporters  immediate and unconditional release.  these arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance,  said shawn crispin, cpj s senior southeast asia representative. wa lone, who joined reuters in july 2016, has covered a range of stories, including the flight of rohingya refugees from rakhine in 2016 and, in much larger numbers, this year. he has written about military land grabs and the killing of ruling party lawyer ko ni in january. this year he jointly won an honorable mention from the society of publishers in asia for reuters coverage of the rakhine crisis in 2016.  he previously worked for the myanmar times, where he covered myanmar s historic 2015 elections, and people s age, a local weekly newspaper, where his editor was myanmar s current minister of

posts in the northern rakhine, and reported from the central part of the state where local buddhists have been  enforcing segregation between rohingya and rakhine communities. he previously worked for root investigation agency, a local news outlet focused on rakhine issues.  i have been arrest  were the four words that wa lone texted to reuters myanmar bureau chief antoni slodkowski on tuesday evening to let him know what was happening. very soon after that wa lone s phone appeared to have been switched off. over the next 24 hours, reuters colleagues in yangon filed a missing persons

" two former top u.s. intelligence officials said on sunday they fear president donald trump is being manipulated by russian president vladimir putin, after trump said he believed putin was sincere in denying russian meddling in the 2016 election. former cia director john brennan and ex national intelligence director james clapper both said trump was mishandling moscow ties even as a special counsel investigates possible collusion between trump s campaign team and russia.      i think mr. trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by mr. putin, afraid of what he could do, or what might come out as a result of these investigations... it s either naivet , ignorance or fear in terms of what mr. trump is doing vis   vis the russians,  brennan said in an appearance with clapper on cnn s  state of the union.    clapper added that foreign leaders who roll out the red carpet for trump are able to manipulate trump.  i do think both the chinese and the russians think they can play him,  clapper said. their comments came after trump told reporters over the  weekend that he had spoken with putin again over allegations of russian meddling in the presidential election and that the russian president again denied any involvement.  i really believe that, when he tells me that, he means it,  trump told reporters.  i think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.  treasury secretary steve mnuchin said on the same show that the criticism leveled against trump s management of relations with russia and china was  ridiculous.   president trump is not getting played by anybody,  mnuchin said.     trump also took a swipe at obama era intelligence officials  brennan, clapper and former fbi director james comey, calling  them  political hacks  and questioning the findings of a u.s. intelligence report that concluded that russians sought to tilt  the election in trump s favor. facing sharp criticism, trump walked back from some of those comments on sunday, saying he has faith in the intelligence leaders he has hired. brennan on sunday called trump s criticism of him a  badge of honor,  and clapper suggested said trump s denial of russian interference in the election  poses a peril to the country.  when asked, brennan declined to say whether he knows of any intelligence to suggest that the russians have compromising or damaging information on trump. a dossier penned by a former british spy contains unverified  claims that russia does have embarrassing information on trump.

" kenyan president uhuru kenyatta was sworn in for a second term on tuesday, shortly before riot police teargassed the convoy of opposition leader raila odinga, who promised supporters he would be sworn in himself on dec. 12. such a move would only deepen divisions opened by the extended election season in kenya, a western ally in a volatile region. months of acrimonious campaigns and sporadic clashes have already blunted growth in east africa s richest economy.  at a lavish inauguration attended by the heads of many african nations, kenyatta did his best to paint a picture of a country moving beyond that divide.    the elections are now firmly behind us ... i will devote my time and energy to build bridges,  he told a rapturous crowd of around 60,000 supporters as he was sworn in for a second, five year term in a sports stadium in the capital nairobi.      but, he warned, kenyans needed to  free ourselves from the baggage of past grievances, and ... keep to the rule of law . such words may ring hollow to citizens accustomed to the government ignoring reports on corruption from the country s auditor general and documentation of hundreds of extrajudicial police killings every year from human rights groups.  last year, kenyatta angered many kenyans by saying he wanted to tackle corruption but his  hands are tied . his government has also promised to improve police accountability, but an independent watchdog has managed to convict only two officers of murder despite thousands of brutality complaints. on tuesday, at least one odinga supporter was killed and three others were injured, a reuters witness said. other witnesses said the man had been shot by the police.  a statement from odinga said five people were shot, including his daughter s driver. television stations ktn and ntv reported that a 7 year old boy was hit by a stray bullet while playing on the balcony of a house near the site of a planned opposition prayer meeting.   when i came home, i did not know it was my child who had been killed. police were passing by shooting,  peter mutuku, the boy s father, was quoted saying on ntv. police could not immediately be reached for comment. less than an hour after kenyatta spoke, kenyan national television carried pictures of riot police swinging clubs at civilians with their hands up.  i didn t hear him say a single word on corruption and how he s going to fight it. i didn t hear anything on justice,  said prominent anti corruption campaigner boniface mwangi.  when he says that there s the rule of law, his actions and the actions of his government show there s no rule of law.  kenyatta won a repeat presidential election on oct. 26 that was boycotted by odinga, who said it would not be free and fair. the supreme court nullified the first presidential election, in august, over irregularities.  supporters of kenyatta   who won the october poll with 98 percent of the vote after odinga s boycott   want the opposition to engage in talks and move on.  i m sure uhuru will be able to bring people together and unite them so we can all work for the country,  said eunice jerobon, a trader who traveled overnight from the rift valley town of kapsabet for the inauguration. but odinga s supporters see such talk of unity as tantamount to surrender. many of them are drawn from poorer parts of the country, and feel angered because they say they are locked out of power and the patronage it brings. political arguments often have ethnic undercurrents, with odinga s supporters pointing out that three of the country s four presidents have come from one ethnic group, the kikuyu, although the country has 44 recognized groups.  odinga accuses the ruling party of stealing the election, overseeing rampant corruption, directing abuse by the security forces and neglecting vast swathes of the country, including odinga s heartland in the west.    this election of october 26 is fake. we do not recognize it,  odinga told supporters from the rooftop of a car.  on dec. 12, we will have an assembly that will swear me in.   shortly after that, riot police teargassed his convoy and charged his supporters.  the opposition had planned to hold a prayer meeting in the capital on tuesday, saying it wanted to commemorate the lives of odinga supporters killed during confrontations with the security forces over the election period.  more than 70 people have been killed in political violence this election season, mostly by the police. riot police sealed off the scene of the rally in the morning, and fired teargas at residents, trying to prevent a crowd from gathering, as a helicopter hovered overhead. roads were blocked by burning tyres, rocks and uprooted billboards.  in his speech, kenyatta promised to raise living standards by increasing jobs, home ownership, electricity connections and health insurance coverage.  he also said all africans would now get visas on arrival in kenya, and members of the east african community

" non eu norway called on brussels and london on wednesday to ensure that brexit does not disrupt its trade relations once britain leaves the european union. norway has chosen to remain out of the eu but pays hundreds of millions of euros to access the single market as a member of the european economic area (eea) and is also in the european free trade area (efta) along with switzerland, iceland and liechtenstein.  to preserve the integrity of the single market, the eu 27, the uk and efta should agree on legal arrangements to enter into at the same time that the eu uk agreement is reached,  marit berger roesland, norway s european affairs minister, said in a speech in dublin. norway is concerned, among other things, about the fate of norwegians living in britain after brexit; fisheries policy; what kind of terms would be given to britain after brexit and whether britain would get preferential treatment over norway. roesland told reuters that while oslo is not at the negotiating table, there was a good understanding of its position in london, and that it was now up to finding a technical solution.  if the eu and uk agree on withdrawal terms relevant to the single market, such as the rights of citizens, we need to find ways to extend these to the members of the eea,  said roesland, who was appointed to the role last month.  likewise any transitional agreements that extend the application of the single market should also include the eea states. otherwise we risk having a fragmented solution and that would be a great problem for norway.

" the state department is considering formally declaring the crackdown on myanmar s rohingya muslims to be ethnic cleansing, u.s. officials said on tuesday, as lawmakers called for sanctions against the southeast asian country s military. pressure has mounted for a tougher u.s. response to the rohingya crisis ahead of president donald trump s maiden visit to asia next month when he will attend a summit of southeast asian countries, including myanmar, in manila. u.s. officials are preparing a recommendation for secretary of state rex tillerson that would define the military led campaign against the rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions, the u.s. government sources said. the proposal   part of an overall review of myanmar policy   could be sent to tillerson as early as this week, and he would then decide whether to adopt it, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. more than 600,000 rohingya muslims have fled rakhine state in buddhist majority myanmar, mostly to neighboring bangladesh, since security forces responded to rohingya militants  attacks on aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. the united nations has already denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. three u.s. officials testifying at a senate hearing on tuesday declined to say whether the treatment of the rohingya  was ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions that washington is considering. those steps, however, stopped short of the most drastic tools at washington s disposal such as reimposing broader economic sanctions suspended under the obama administration.  i m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that i ve seen during a long career,  deputy assistant secretary of state mark storella said when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. senator ben cardin, the ranking democrat on the foreign affairs committee, said he considered the treatment of the rohingya  genocide  and is working on bipartisan legislation that could spell out whether additional sanctions are needed. myanmar, also known as burma, insists that action was needed to combat  terrorists.  the recommendation to tillerson   first reported by the associated press   is not expected to include a determination on whether  crimes against humanity  have been committed, as this would require further legal deliberations, one u.s. official said.  the state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. some u.s. lawmakers criticized aung san suu kyi, head of myanmar s civilian led government and a nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in washington, for failing to do more. senator bob corker, republican chairman of the committee, chided suu kyi for what he called  dismissiveness  toward the plight of the rohingya and said it might be time for a  policy adjustment  toward myanmar. at the hearing, patrick murphy, deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs, said additional  sanctions were being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen washington s ability to influence myanmar.

" muslim majority malaysia s former prime minister mahathir mohamad on friday called u.s. president donald trump an  international bully  and a  villain  for his move to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital. trump last week reversed decades of u.s. policy by recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, and said the united states would move its embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv in the coming years. the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting israeli palestinian peace. israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. the anger from trump s decision  will lead to what is called terrorism , the 93 year old mahathir told a protest rally in front of the u.s. embassy in kuala lumpur.  today we have an international bully. trump, go find someone your own size. this (jerusalem plan) will only stir the anger of the muslims,  said mahathir, the chairman of malaysia s opposition coalition.   we must use all our power to oppose this villain who is the president of the united states,  he said, urging all muslim countries to cut ties with israel.  muhyiddin yassin, another opposition leader, called on the malaysian government to not proceed with planned investments in the united states. last week, malaysian prime minister najib razak urged muslims worldwide to oppose any recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital.  social media users in muslim majority malaysia vowed to boycott u.s. companies, such as mcdonald s corp, following trump s decision. the chain s malaysian franchise said it did not support or engage in any political or religious conflicts.         deputy prime minister zahid ahamd hamidi on friday said najib and the leader of the opposition pan malaysian islamic party (pas) would lead a protest rally next friday in malaysia s administrative capital of putrajaya, media said.

" president donald trump’s nominee for ambassador to china promised on tuesday to take a firm line with beijing on issues from north korea to trade disputes and human rights, and seemed poised for an easy confirmation by the u.s. senate. iowa governor terry branstad said he would use his decades of experience with china to press beijing to do more to encourage north korea to curb its nuclear ambitions. “there’s other things they can do diplomatically and economically to send a clear signal that they, as well as the united states and other countries in the world, do not tolerate this expansion of nuclear technology and missiles,” branstad said at his confirmation hearing. pressed, branstad said “there may well be” a role for measures such as imposing secondary sanctions on chinese banks or other entities that violated u.n. security council resolutions by doing business with north korea. he offered few specifics. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang reiterated that china was serious about enforcing u.n. resolutions and, referring to the possibility of secondary u.s. sanctions, said china opposed other countries using their law to sanction others or to harm chinese interests. chinese president xi jinping has called branstad, 70, an “old friend” after decades of dealings on agricultural trade. but the republican governor insisted he would take on difficult issues complicating washington’s relationship with its largest trading partner and major creditor. that would contrast with trump’s recent warm words for xi, which have caused some u.s. allies to wonder if trump’s focus on working with china on north korea means washington may not still have their backs. “the fact that the leader of china calls us an old friend, doesn’t mean that i’m going to be at all reluctant or bashful of bringing up issues ... be it human rights or intellectual property rights,” branstad told the senate foreign relations committee. committee members expressed few concerns about branstad, signaling he likely will be confirmed easily. they had tough words for china. senator bob corker, the panel’s republican chairman, blasted china’s actions in the south china sea, and “cyber theft of intellectual property.” he warned against focusing on short term goals at the expense of long term u.s. interests. “there’s no country in the world that we have so many issues with,” corker said. branstad took a hard line on the south china sea, saying, “china cannot be allowed to use its artificial islands to coerce its neighbors or limit freedom of navigation or overflight.” trump has taken an “america first” approach to trade. branstad also stressed the importance of opening markets to agricultural goods, protecting intellectual property and addressing china’s “unfair and illegal” sales of low priced steel.

" georgia governor nathan deal said on monday he will veto a so called religious freedom bill passed by the state legislature that has drawn national criticism for discriminating against same sex couples. the measure, which states that no pastor can be forced to perform a same sex wedding, was recently passed by the republican controlled legislature.  under the bill, faith based groups could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organization’s, while churches and religious schools would have the right to reject holding events for people or groups to whom they object. deal, a republican, said he could not support the legislation, which had drawn wide criticism from corporations and had triggered threats of a state boycott by the entertainment industry. deal said he was not bullied into his decision but felt a law was not necessary. “i do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith based community in georgia,” deal said at news conference on the legislation, noting his religious faith. similar bills in states such as indiana and arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat, and north carolina is currently seeing protest over a new law that bars transgender people from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. deal’s decision was immediately celebrated by gay rights advocates, including the national human rights campaign. “our message to governor nathan deal was loud and clear: this deplorable legislation was bad for his constituents, bad for business, and bad for georgia’s future,” hrc president chad griffin said in a statement. he added that deal had “set an example for other elected officials to follow.” mike griffin, spokesman for the georgia baptist convention, which lobbied for the bill, said his group’s 1.3 million members will continue fighting for it. “all we wanted was protection from government overreach,” he said, noting his disappointment in deal, a two term governor. “we feel that he’s let down the people of faith and all of georgia by not signing the bill.”  critics of the legislation included marquee hollywood stars, such as anne hathaway and julianne moore, as well as movie and tv studios 21st century fox, nbc universal, time warner, walt disney, amc, viacom and marvel entertainment. more than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including delta airlines and coca cola also came out against it.  “georgia is a welcoming state,” deal said.

" panama has agreed to extradite a former state governor from mexico s ruling institutional revolutionary party (pri) who is wanted in his homeland on corruption charges, the two countries said on monday. roberto borge, who from 2010 to 2016 was governor of the state of quintana roo, home to the tourist resort cancun, was detained in panama city airport in june with the aid of interpol as he was preparing to board a flight to paris. corruption promises to be one of the major issues in mexico s july 2018 presidential election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict of interest rows that have dogged the cabinet and president enrique pena nieto himself. the law bars mexican presidents from seeking re election. mexican prosecutors accuse borge of using funds obtained illegally, embezzlement and abuse of public office. the mexican foreign ministry and the attorney general s office said in a statement panama s foreign ministry had notified borge that the extradition was going ahead. panama s foreign ministry said in a separate statement that, after being notified, borge announced that he would have his lawyers appeal against the extradition. the ministry did not give details of how the mexican aimed to justify his appeal. borge had long been accused of corruption by opposition parties, although he has denied the allegations. other former pri governors are also facing prosecution in the run up to next year s presidential contest. javier duarte, who governed the mexican state of veracruz for the pri until last year, was extradited from guatemala to mexico on july 17. he is accused of embezzlement and engaging in organized crime.

" the white house defended the president’s executive order to u.s. agencies to rescind two government regulations for every new rule introduced, after several advocacy groups filed a lawsuit on wednesday challenging the trump administration over the move. the national resources defense council, communications workers of america, and public citizen said in their lawsuit that the jan. 30 order would harm the public. they said it would “block or force the repeal of regulations needed to protect health, safety, and the environment, across a broad range of topics   from automobile safety, to occupational health, to air pollution, to endangered species.” the white house defended the order, saying that it was part of the administration’s efforts to help companies create jobs and that the groups are making assumptions about the order’s impact.  “the lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are wildly inaccurate,” white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters at a daily press briefing. he added that over regulation has hurt economic growth and that reviewing regulations should be welcomed. the order does not apply to most of the financial reform rules introduced by the obama administration or to rules mandated by statutes.     republican president donald trump’s order is a part of his party’s larger effort to undo many of the actions of former president barack obama, a democrat who left office last month after two four year terms.  in congress, conservative lawmakers have already moved to stamp out five obama era rules on corruption, the environment, labor and guns. companies have lauded the effort to deregulate, saying it will help boost their businesses and the larger u.s. economy. on wednesday, tokyo based softbank group corp, whose chief executive has backed trump’s efforts, said easing rules will make it easier to do business in the united states. in addition to trump, wednesday’s lawsuit in u.s. district court for the district of columbia named federal departments and agencies, particularly those with jurisdiction over environmental, transportation and energy issues.    the groups argued that trump overstepped his constitutional power and that the order “directs federal agencies to engage in unlawful actions that will harm countless americans, including plaintiffs’ members.” ",0

" the united states is voicing skepticism about russian president vladimir putin s announcement of a major withdrawal of russian troops from syria and is arguing that his declaration of victory against islamic state was premature. putin, during a surprise visit on monday to russia s hmeymim air base in syria, declared that the work of russian forces was largely done in backing the syrian government against militants in the country s war following the defeat of  the most battle hardened group of international terrorists.   still, u.s. officials are challenging the russian and syrian portrayal of syria as a country poised for peace once the final enclaves of the islamic state militant group, known as isis, are recaptured.  syrian government forces, u.s. officials said, are too few, too poor and too weak to secure the country. islamic state, and other militants in syria, have ample opportunity to regroup, especially if the political grievances that drove the conflict remain unresolved, the officials said.  we think the russian declarations of isis  defeat are premature,  a white house national security council spokeswoman said.  we have repeatedly seen in recent history that a premature declaration of victory was followed by a failure to consolidate military gains, stabilize the situation, and create the conditions that prevent terrorists from reemerging .   the u.s. military in syria, which unlike the russians are operating there without the blessing of damascus, has long been skeptical of moscow s announced drawdowns. marine major adrian rankine galloway, a pentagon spokesman, said the united states had not observed any significant withdrawal since putin s announcement.  although he did not predict future moves, he said:  there have been no meaningful reductions in combat troops following russia s previous announcements planned departures from syria.  the washington based institute for the study of war said moscow s past announcements of pullouts led to a recalibration of russian forces.   russia has previously used claims of partial withdrawals in order to rotate out select units for refit and repair, remove redundant capabilities, and reinsert alternative weapons systems better suited for the next phase of pro regime operations,  it wrote in a research note on tuesday. the u.s. military still has around 2,000 troops in syria and has announced that any withdrawal will be conditions based, arguing a longer term presence of american forces would be needed to ensure islamic state s lasting defeat.  russia s announcement, however, suggested a different image of syria in which foreign forces were becoming unnecessary. after turning the tide of the conflict in syrian president bashar al assad s favor, putin wants to help broker a peace deal. a senior trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the united states believed assad would fail if he attempts to impose  victor s peace.  the odds of syria breaking into a civil war again would be high without meaningful political reconciliation, the official said. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on tuesday stressed the importance of a roadmap for peace, including elections that would allow voting by syrians overseas who fled to the conflict.   and it is our belief that through that process, the assad regime will no longer be part of that leadership,  tillerson said.

" alberto nisman, the argentine prosecutor who was found dead days after accusing former president cristina fernandez of covering up iran s role in the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center, was murdered, a federal judge said on tuesday. in a 656 page ruling, judge julian ercolini said there was sufficient proof to conclude that the shot to the head that killed nisman in january 2015 was not self inflicted. that marked the first time any judge has said the case was a murder. fernandez and others had suggested the death was a suicide, but a prosecutor investigating the case last year recommended it be pursued as a murder probe.  nisman s death could not have been a suicide,  ercolini wrote in tuesday s ruling, which also charged diego lagomarsino, a former employee of nisman s, with accessory to murder. lagomarsino has acknowledged lending nisman the gun that killed him the day before he was to appear before congress to detail his allegation against fernandez. but he has said nisman asked him for the gun to protect himself and his family. fernandez, now a senator, was indicted for treason earlier this month over nisman s allegations that she worked behind the scenes to clear iran of blame for the attack on the amia jewish center, which killed 85 people, in an effort to normalize relations and clinch a 2013 grains for oil deal with tehran. human rights groups and the former head of interpol have criticized that indictment. tehran has denied links to the attack.

" hedge funds may have taken too big a bite of apple inc (aapl.o).  shares of the iphone maker are one of the biggest bets among hedge funds, with 47 of them listing apple among their ten largest holdings as of the end of 2015, according to a report from goldman sachs on march 18. at the same time, mutual funds are going the opposite direction: apple is their second largest underweight holding, meaning the funds invest less of their portfolio in the company than its percentage weighting in the benchmark s&p 500 index. the difference of opinion on apple, with shares flat year to date, is one reason hedge funds are again lagging. the average hedge fund was down 3.3 percent through february, while the average large cap core mutual fund fell just 0.8 percent, according to data from fund tracker morningstar.  mutual funds, meanwhile, have benefited from being overweight in facebook inc (fb.o), cvs health corp (cvs.n), and cisco systems inc (csco.o), according to goldman.  mutual fund managers believe apple no longer enjoys the outsized prospects it had in the past. “we’ve done very well with this company for a long time but it’s so large now that it’s becoming impossible for it to move the needle meaningfully” in terms of revenue growth or profits, said one fund manager from a well known firm. the manager, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, sold all of his shares in the company.  shares of apple fell 6.5 percent on jan. 27, the day after the company reported its slowest ever rise in iphone shipments and forecast quarterly sales declining for the first time in 13 years. the stock dipped 0.7 percent to $105.32 on thursday.   with the higher concentration of hedge funds owning the stock, apple should brace for more activist calls to raise its dividend, offer more share buybacks, or acquire more companies to increase short term returns, said todd rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at s&p capital iq. “your typical mutual fund manager is going to have more patience than your typical hedge fund manager, who if they have a sizeable stake are going to push for structural or corporate changes to enhance shareholder value,” he said.  hedge fund bridgewater associates increased its stake in apple by 19 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, while tiger global management initiated a position, buying 10.6 million shares in the same period, according to sec filings. at the same time, well known activists such as carl icahn and david einhorn have trimmed their positions..  hedge fund manager morris mark, whose firm mark asset management oversees $500 million in assets, said he is maintaining a large position in apple, even as the shares flat line. he sees the iphone as the gateway into new home based products.  “they’re going to come out with more services layered on top of this incredible franchise, and you are going to see their entire ecosystem grow,” he said.

" u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that “nobody wants terrorists to have firearms” and that he was open to suggestions from experts on legislation that could address the problem, following the worst mass shooting in u.s. history. mcconnell, a republican, made his remarks amid blistering attacks by democrats on the lack of action in congress on legislation to prevent suspects on “watch lists” from purchasing guns or explosives. while there was no firm evidence of republicans and democrats in either the senate or house of representatives moving toward a compromise, there were hints they at least might be willing to talk. “maybe we can find some middle ground. i hope so,” said dick durbin, the no. 2 senate democrat. the debate in congress over firearms was reignited on sunday after a gunman in orlando, florida, armed with an assault rifle killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and injured 53 others before he was shot to death by law enforcement officers. the assailant, new york born omar mateen, had been investigated by the fbi for 10 months in 2013 and 2014 over possible connections he had to foreign militant groups. democrats are pressuring republicans in the senate and house to quickly bring up legislation closing a loophole that allows those on “no fly” watch lists to purchase weapons in the united states. the democrats are targeting a justice department appropriations bill this week, hoping to add an amendment prohibiting such gun sales. a similar effort last december failed. “there’s no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns,” said senate democratic leader harry reid. mcconnell took a swipe at the democrats, saying: “our suspicion is this is basically a politically motivated effort that we’re likely to see” on the justice department spending bill. the republican leader added, however: “we’re open   nobody wants terrorists to have firearms   we’re open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful.” on wednesday, senators from both parties will have an opportunity to speak directly to some experts when federal bureau of investigation director james comey and homeland security secretary jeh johnson are scheduled to brief them on the orlando attack. the officials briefed house members on tuesday and several house democrats brought up the watch list issue. “there was some question about procedures going forward,” said representative jan schakowsky, a democratic member of the house intelligence committee. but house majority leader kevin mccarthy, the no. 2 republican in that chamber, told reporters that law enforcement was already being notified if people being investigated for terrorism try to buy firearms. “if you listen, they are being notified.” durbin said he and his colleagues might pursue other gun related amendments as well, including tougher background checks on gun buyers, closing some gun show loopholes and possibly new limits on assault rifles like the one used in orlando.

" donald trump hasn’t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  a lawyer for the new york real estate developer demanded on wednesday the new york times retract a story in which two women accused trump of inappropriately touching them. if the newspaper did not comply, trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would “pursue all available actions and remedies,” the lawyer, marc kasowitz, said in a letter.  trump said at a rally on thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  an attorney for the times, david mccraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would “welcome the opportunity” to defend it in court. over the years, media outlets including the wall street journal, the village voice, the new york post and fortune magazine have reported receiving similar threats from trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. however, trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service westlaw, a unit of thomson reuters.       the last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. trump filed the case after the chicago tribune’s architecture critic called his proposed 150 story manhattan skyscraper an “atrocious, ugly monstrosity.” in 1985, a federal judge in manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a first amendment right to express his opinion. the skyscraper was never built. in the 32 years since trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. he was successful in one of those cases.  book author and former new york times reporter timothy o’brien defeated a trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after trump underwent a grueling deposition by o’brien’s lawyers.  trump’s suit against o’brien, which also named o’brien’s publisher, time warner book group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman’s net worth. a new jersey state judge found in 2009 that trump had not established o’brien’s actual malice.     former miss universe contestant sheena monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as “rigged.” the arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in manhattan in 2013. the court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014.     the same year, a san diego federal judge ruled tarla makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against trump university, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the better business bureau that trump university engaged in fraudulent business practices. the judge, gonzalo curiel, dismissed trump’s defamation claim.     trump’s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the reuters docket search may have missed.     u.s. courts have routinely deemed trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. that means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in “reckless disregard” for the truth. if trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. the new york times attorney, david mccraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. any trump claim will be difficult because trump’s accusers were on the record, said jane kirtley, a media law expert at university of minnesota law school. that would bolster the newspaper’s argument that it didn’t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. trump has vowed to “open up our libel laws,” if he wins the presidency on nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. in reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. court records show that trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a trump casino in indiana, were dismissed. one defamation suit against trump survived dismissal, however. stock analyst marvin roffman sued trump for $2 million in federal court in philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the taj mahal casino in atlantic city. roffman alleged trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. after a federal

" former u.s. congressman anthony weiner wept on friday as he pleaded guilty to sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl, capping a “sexting” scandal that played a role in last year’s u.s. presidential election during its waning days. wearing a navy suit, maroon tie and his wedding band, a tearful weiner, 52, described his conduct before u.s. district judge loretta preska in new york city. “i have a sickness, but i do not have an excuse,” weiner said, apologizing to the 15 year old girl to whom he sent inappropriate images and messages last year.  hours after the court hearing, his wife huma abedin, a senior aide to 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, filed for divorce in a manhattan court, according to the new york post. a lawyer for abedin did not immediately respond to a  request for comment. the charge of transferring obscene material to a minor carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but weiner is likely to get less when sentenced on sept. 8. as part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would consider a term between 21 months and 27 months “fair and appropriate.” the plea deal appeared to seal the demise of a once promising political career derailed by a series of scandals, stemming from what weiner described in court as a compulsive need to seek sexual attention from women on social media. the investigation into his exchanges with the teenage girl also roiled the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign days before election day.   while searching weiner’s laptop, federal agents found a batch of emails from his wife. as a result, james comey, then director of the federal bureau of investigation, announced in late october that the agency was reviewing the messages to determine whether to reopen its investigation into clinton’s handling of official correspondence. clinton, who was leading in national polls at the time, has blamed her loss to republican donald trump in part on comey’s announcement, even though the director said two days before the election in november that the review had uncovered no new evidence. abedin had announced her separation from weiner last summer after the latest round of explicit messages emerged, including an image of weiner’s crotch as he lay in bed with their young son. the controversy over clinton’s use of a private email server while she was u.s. secretary of state dogged her throughout the campaign. trump accused clinton of endangering national security by exposing classified information to potential hacking. in testimony to congress two weeks ago, comey said he felt “mildly nauseous” at the suggestion his actions may have swayed the election, but added that he had no regrets. trump fired comey days later amid the fbi’s probe into whether trump’s campaign colluded with russia to defeat clinton, an allegation the president has denied. weiner, who served parts of new york city for 12 years in the u.s. house of representatives, resigned in 2011 after an explicit photograph was posted on his twitter account. he initially claimed his account had been hacked but eventually acknowledged he had sent the image as well as inappropriate messages to several women. two years later, he announced a run for new york city mayor but dropped out of the race when more explicit messages became public. the federal investigation into weiner came to light last year after the daily mail, a british newspaper, published an interview with the north carolina teen. on friday, weiner said he has been receiving “intensive” mental health treatment since then. “these destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my life’s dream of public service,” weiner said. in a statement, acting u.s. attorney in manhattan joon kim said, “weiner’s conduct was not only reprehensible, but a federal crime, one for which he is now convicted and will be sentenced.” ",0
" saudi arabia on saturday suspended any dialogue with qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts , just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of both countries suggested a breakthrough in the gulf dispute. saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman spoke by the telephone with qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani on friday when they discussed the gulf dispute, state media from both countries reported earlier. saudi arabia, the uae, egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5, suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest u.s. military base. the nations say doha supports regional foe iran and islamists, charges qatar s leaders deny. kuwait has been trying to mediate the dispute.  during the call, the emir of qatar expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries to ensure the interests of all,  saudi state news agency spa reported.  the details will be announced later after the kingdom of saudi arabia concludes an understanding with the united arab emirates, the kingdom of bahrain and the arab republic of egypt,  spa said. the phone call was the first publicly reported contact between the two leaders since the start of the crisis.  qatar s state news agency qna said the phone call was based on coordination of u.s. president donald trump who had earlier talked with sheikh tamim. trump on thursday said he would be willing to step in and mediate the worst dispute in decades among the u.s. allied arab states and qatar, and said he thinks a deal could come quickly. both qatar s emir and the saudi crown prince  stressed the need to resolve the crisis by sitting down to the dialogue table to ensure the unity and stability of the gcc countries,  qna reported. sheikh tamim welcomed the proposal of prince mohammed during the call  to assign two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of the states,  qna said. saudi arabia later issued a second statement citing an unnamed official at the ministry of the foreign affairs denying the qna report.  what was published on the qatar news agency is a continuation of the distortion of the qatari authority of the facts,  spa reported citing the saudi official.  the kingdom of saudi arabia announces the suspension of any dialogue or communication with the authority in qatar until a clear statement is issued clarifying its position in public.

" donald trump directly asked russian president vladimir putin during their talks at a weekend summit in vietnam whether allegations of russian meddling in last year s u.s. presidential election were true, ria news agency reported on sunday. the u.s. president said on saturday he believed putin s denial of the accusations despite the view of u.s. intelligence agencies that russian interference did take place. trump later distanced himself from his remarks. according to ria, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov, asked how trump had raised the question about alleged russian meddling, said:  in fact, trump asked whether that information could be true, how true it could be, and president putin, for his part, explained his position, which is that russia did not interfere in any election and this could not be the case.  putin also said he did not understand  the groundless statements on the issue being made in the united states , peskov added. the russian issue has clouded trump s first year in office. trump s initial comments on saturday drew criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling through hacking and the release of emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton. on sunday, trump was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. he has previously called the allegations of election campaign collusion with moscow a hoax.

" a new version of a trump administration travel ban will not stop green card residency holders or travelers already on planes from entering the united states, u.s. secretary for homeland security john kelly said on saturday. u.s. president donald trump’s initial attempt to clamp down for security reasons on immigration from seven muslim majority countries and on refugees snarled to a halt amid a judicial backlash and chaos at airports. “the president is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first (order). and i will have opportunity to work (on) a rollout plan, in particular to make sure that there’s no one in a sense caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports,” kelly said at the munich security conference. asked whether green card residency permit holders would be allowed in, kelly said: “it’s a good assumption and, as far as the visas go, ... if they’re in motion from some distant land to the united states, when they arrive they will be allowed in.”  he promised “a short phase in period to make sure that people on the other end don’t get on airplanes. but if they’re on an airplane and inbound, they’ll be allowed to enter the country.” a draft of the replacement executive order shows that the administration aims to put restrictions on citizens of the same seven muslim majority countries covered by the initial order, according to the wall street journal, which cites an internal state department memo. the replacement order could be issued as early as tuesday, the journal reported, citing a u.s. government official. the administration would seek to implement the new order a week to two weeks after it is signed, and covers citizens from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen, the journal said. trump’s original order, which he said was meant to head off attacks by islamist militants, barred people from those same countries from entering for 90 days and excluded all refugees for 120 days, except those from syria, who were banned indefinitely. the abrupt implementation of the order last month plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from the countries affected, and from western allies and some of america’s leading corporations, especially technology firms.

" canadian police said they were investigating the mysterious deaths of barry sherman, founder of canadian pharmaceutical firm apotex inc, and his wife, honey, one of the nation s wealthiest couples whose bodies were found in their mansion on friday. police said they learned of the deaths after responding to a midday (1700 gmt) medical call at the sherman s home in an affluent section of northeast toronto. two bodies covered in blankets were removed from the home and loaded into an unmarked van on friday evening.  the circumstances of their death appear suspicious and we are treating it that way,  said constable david hopkinson. homicide detectives later told reporters gathered outside the home that there were no signs of forced entry. their neighbors, business associates and some of canada s most powerful politicians said they were saddened by the deaths.   our condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit,  prime minister justin trudeau wrote on twitter. toronto mayor john tory said in statement he was  shocked and heartbroken  to learn of the deaths, noting that the couple had made extensive contributions to the city.  toronto police are investigating, and i hope that investigation will be able to provide answers for all of us who are mourning this tremendous loss,  tory said. the shermans recently listed their home for sale for nearly c$7 million ($5.4 million). a real estate agent discovered the bodies in the basement while preparing for an open house, the toronto globe and mail reported, citing a relative. sherman, 75, founded privately held apotex in 1974, growing it by introducing large numbers of low cost generic drugs that took market share from branded pharmaceuticals. he stepped down as chief executive in 2012 but remained executive chairman.  forbes has estimated sherman s fortune at $3.2 billion. apotex is the world s no. 7 generic drugmaker with 11,000 employees and annual sales of more than c$2 billion in more than 45 countries, according to its website. the couple was known for their philanthropy, giving tens of millions of dollars to hospitals, universities and jewish organizations, cbc reported.  they were extremely successful in business, but also very, very giving people,  former ontario premier bob rae told cbc.  it s going to be a very, very big loss.  the globe and mail reported in february that lobbying commissioner karen shepherd was investigating a complaint about a 2015 political fundraiser that trudeau had attended.

" rolling back territorial gains by the taliban and strengthening the afghanistan army’s ability to fight will be two key objectives of president donald trump’s new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on tuesday. trump, in a televised speech on monday, promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government. in outlining his strategy to give the u.s. military more authority to make battlefield decisions, trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress. the senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the afghan government or by the taliban and other extremist groups such as islamic state’s afghan affiliate. “it’s also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al qaeda and isis, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. also key will be the effectiveness of the afghan army and whether u.s. led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the taliban, the official added.  trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said. “i think we’re going to be taking the temperature continuously,” the official said. “i don’t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. but from that point on, it’s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.” u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban’s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america’s longest military conflict.    three u.s. officials said on tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in afghanistan and assess the contributions of the afghan government, pakistan, india and america’s nato allies. one of the officials said there was no point “in setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn’t have to do more.” “what we’re after is a progressive process,” the official said, “so for example the afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don’t need us anymore, the government in kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.” but representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, struck a critical tone on tuesday. “while a ‘conditions based’ approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the afghan government to reform itself and give the afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,” schiff said in a statement.

" a senior democratic lawmaker said sunday he had “no doubt” that russia was behind recent hacking attempts targeting state election systems, and urged the obama administration to publicly blame moscow for trying to undermine confidence in the nov. 8 presidential contest. the remarks from representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the intelligence committee in the u.s. house of representatives, come amid heightened concerns among u.s. and state officials about the security of voting machines and databases, and unsubstantiated allegations from republican candidate donald trump that the election could be “rigged.” “i have no doubt [this is russia]. and i don’t think the administration has any doubt,” schiff said during an appearance on abc’s “this week.” schiff’s call to name and shame the kremlin came a week after trump questioned widely held conclusions made privately by the u.s. intelligence community that russia is responsible for the hacking activity. “it could be russia, but it could also be china,” trump said during a televised debate with democratic candidate hillary clinton. “it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” on saturday, homeland security secretary jeh johnson said hackers have probed the voting systems of many u.s. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data. schiff said he doubted hackers could falsify vote tallies in a way to affect the election outcome. officials and experts have said the decentralized and outdated nature of u.s. voting technology makes such hacks more unlikely. but cyber attacks on voter registration systems could “sow discord” on election day, schiff said. he further added that leaks of doctored emails would be difficult to disprove and could “be election altering.” the national security agency, fbi and dhs all concluded weeks ago that russian intelligence agencies conducted, directed or coordinated all the major cyberattacks on u.s. political organizations, including the democratic national committee, and individuals, a u.s. official who is participating in the investigations said on sunday.     however, the official said, white house officials have resisted naming the russians publicly because doing so could result in escalating cyberattacks, and because it is considered impossible to offer public, unclassified proof of the allegation.  schiff and senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the u.s. senate intelligence committee, said last month they had concluded russian intelligence agencies were “making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election.” ",0
" three groups planning to demonstrate at the republican national convention in july sued the city of cleveland on tuesday, seeking immediate changes to security measures due to their “unacceptable restrictions” on free speech. presumptive presidential nominee donald trump is expected to officially become the republican party’s candidate for president at the july 18 21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations, some of which have resulted in clashes between the candidate’s supporters and opponents. led by the american civil liberties union (aclu), the three groups filed suit in u.s. district court for the northern district of ohio, naming the city of cleveland and mayor frank jackson as defendants. dan williams, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a phone call he had not seen the lawsuit and that the city does not comment on ongoing litigation. he said the city and the aclu have discussed protester rights and regulations in meetings.     the plaintiffs are citizens for trump, a texas based group that supports the businessman’s campaign; organize ohio, a liberal activist group; and northeast ohio coalition for the homeless, a charitable organization. the lawsuit contends that cleveland has imposed an unnecessarily large restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) in the city center where free speech and mobility will be limited. “the limitations apply far beyond the part of the city where the convention activities will take place. ... these regulations severely limit the opportunities for members of the public to exercise their expressive rights during the convention,” the lawsuit said. the lawsuit seeks to reduce the size and regulations of the restricted an area and asks the court to immediately address the city’s rules for issuing protest permits and what the aclu called persistent delays in approving those permits.  “many of these applications have been pending for months   some as long as four months. the city’s continuing refusal to approve or deny these applications leaves the organizers of these activities in limbo,” the lawsuit said. protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, the aclu has said.

" the u.s. supreme court on thursday imposed some limits on the kind of fraud claims that can be brought against federal contractors in a case involving a suit against one of america’s largest hospital operators over a woman’s death at one of its facilities. but the 8 0 ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company, universal health services, and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the u.s. false claims act, which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded. the justices threw out a 2015 appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of yarushka rivera to sue universal health services under the false claims act, but sent the case back to a lower court, meaning the suit could potentially still proceed. rivera suffered a fatal seizure in 2009 at age 19 a mental health facility owned by the company in lawrence, massachusetts. the lawsuit said the facility provided “gravely inadequate treatment” and used “unsupervised and unqualified personnel.” the ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower court’s expansive view of a company’s liability under the false claims act.  roy englert, king of prussia, pennsylvania based universal health services’ lawyer, said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a “new rigorous standard” for determining if the claims can move forward. rivera’s parents, julio escobar and carmen correa, accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal medicaid funding to provide treatment to low income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the lawrence facility. the ruling “accepts the basic notion that fraudsters can’t provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability,” said david frederick, the lawyer for rivera’s family. businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits, or disallow completely, lawsuits based on a federal contractor’s failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract.  the court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the government’s decision to make the payment to the company. justice clarence thomas, writing for the court, said the parents “may well have adequately pleaded a violation” of the fraud law, but added that the false claims act “is not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations.” the obama administration had backed the parents.

" sabih al masri, a palestinian billionaire and jordan s most influential businessman, was released after several days of detention in saudi arabia, the latest in a series of events marking the worst crackdown on the rich and powerful in the country s modern history. masri, the chairman of amman based arab bank, the country s largest lender, was detained last tuesday hours before he was planning to leave after chairing meetings of companies he owns, sources said. he said on sunday saudi authorities had given him  all respect . the authorities have not commented on his detention, which came after his confidants had warned him against traveling to the saudi capital following a series of mass arrests in early november, the sources said. sources familiar with the case said he was questioned about his links to saudi partners among the royals, ministers and officials who were rounded up in last month s crackdown. his case carried echoes of that of lebanese prime minister saad al hariri, who announced his resignation from riyadh, drawing accusations from lebanese officials that he had been coerced by the saudis. both the saudis and hariri denied that, but hariri later rescinded his resignation. masri s detention sent shockwaves through business circles in jordan and the palestinian territories. masri s multi billion  dollar investments in hotels and banking in jordan are a cornerstone of the economy of the kingdom and he is by far the biggest investor in palestinian territories. arab bank shares, which account for almost a quarter of the $24 billion market capitalization of the amman exchange, ended just 1.44 percent lower at start of weekly trade as investor fears ebbed with news of his release. officials and businessmen had warned of the reverberations of the crisis on an aid strapped jordanian economy already plagued by high debts. saudi arabia is a major donor.  masri has since taking the helm at arab bank in 2012 helped boost confidence in one of the arab world s largest private financial institutions.  the bank, which was first established in jerusalem in 1930, has a balance sheet of over $45 billion and has earned a reputation of resilience in the face of regional political turmoil. masri said on sunday that he would be returning to jordan after finishing business meetings in riyadh in the next two days.  all is well and am happy (to be released) and i was given all respect by everyone here,  a saudi citizen of palestinian origin, told reuters from his home in riyadh. a member of a prominent merchant family from nablus in the israeli occupied west bank, masri amassed a fortune by partnering with influential saudis in a catering business to supply troops during the u.s. led military operation to retake kuwait from iraq in the 1991 gulf war. masri is the founder of saudi astra group, which has wide interests in diversified industries ranging from agro industry to telecommunications, construction and mining across the region.  reasons for masri s detention were not clear, but political sources said the saudis might have used him to put pressure on jordan s king abdullah not to attend a muslim summit last week to discuss u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital. the jordanian monarch attended the istanbul summit, however. he is a custodian of muslim holy sites in jerusalem and has been vocal in criticizing trump over his decision on jerusalem. saudi arabia, whose relations with the united states have warmed with trump taking a harder line against its arch rival iran than his predecessor, appears to have taken a softer line on the decision on jerusalem than in the past, according to analysts. riyadh sent a junior minister to the istanbul meeting.

" the u.s. house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on moscow, triggering an angry reaction from russian officials, but analysts are playing down the impact. the sanctions, which have yet to be approved by the u.s. senate and president donald trump, expand and tweak a list of existing sanctions, but cannot be viewed as a game changer, analysts said. russian president vladimir putin will decide if and how moscow will retaliate once the fresh sanctions become law. below are highlights from the bill and analysts’ reactions:   the united states “should continue to uphold and seek unity with european and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the russian federation, which have been effective and instrumental in countering russian aggression in ukraine”. “the secretary of the treasury shall submit ... a report describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products.” the secretary of the treasury shall review sanctions from 2014 “to ensure that the directive prohibits the conduct by united states persons or persons within the united states of all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to the directive, their property, or their interests in property”. “the secretary of the treasury may determine that a person meets one or more of the criteria ... if that person is a state owned entity operating in the railway, or metals and mining sector of the economy of the russian federation.” the secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state, shall submit a detailed report on russia’s senior foreign political figures and oligarchs. the bill is designed “to continue to oppose the nordstream 2 pipeline given its detrimental impacts on the european union’s energy security, gas market development in central and eastern europe, and energy reforms in ukraine”. trump, in coordination with allies of the united states, may impose sanctions on an entity that makes an investment described in the act or “sells, leases, or provides to the russian federation, for the construction of russian energy export pipelines, goods, services, technology, information, or support ... any of which has a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more; or that, during a 12 month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5,000,000 or more.” “with the senate voting 92 2 and the house 419 3, it is highly unlikely that president trump would veto the bill,” said charles robertson, global chief economist at renaissance capital in london. “long term this is really bad news. we know from jackson vaneck that these kind of sanctions are hard to remove once in place. this will further stall foreign investment into russia, negatively impacting growth and development, furthering long term capital flight and brain drain. it will further the isolation from the west, and stagnation of the russian economy,” said tim ash, a senior strategist at bluebay asset management in london. “most importantly for russia, the original senate bill with regard to nord stream 2 was watered down as it now requires coordination with ‘allies’ when imposing such sanctions. moreover, the bill only gives the option for the president to introduce such sanctions, but does not require that he does so. so, overall, i expect marginal negative effect,” ivan tchakarov, senior economist at citi in moscow. “in general we think that the impact on the russian economy should be relatively limited. compared to 2014 when the first set of sanctions was introduced the russian economy is in much better state to weather the measures,” said liza ermolenko, emerging european economist at barclays in london. “in the u.s. sanctions bill we have not seen any direct negative implications for the rouble so far. some tightening of the trade financing terms would not have a material negative impact on the rouble, although it may lead to a shortage of the dollar liquidity in the market and it’s not clear how well companies and banks were prepared to this,” said alexey pogorelov, chief economist at credit suisse in london.

" retired lt. gen. michael flynn, under consideration by republican donald trump as a possible vice presidential choice, said on sunday he favors a woman’s right to choose whether to have an abortion. that stance places flynn, the former head of the defense intelligence agency, at odds with the official republican party position, which is firmly anti abortion. asked about his position on abortion on abc news’ “this week,” flynn, a registered democrat, said “women have to be able to choose” and that women “have to make the decision because they’re the ... ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.”  trump, the presumptive republican white house nominee, has said he will pick his vice president before the party’s nomination convention opens on july 18. flynn has been an adviser to the trump campaign since early this year.  the washington post reported on saturday that trump is becoming increasingly infatuated with flynn, who ran the defense intelligence agency from 2012 2014 under president barack obama, because he believes national unrest and the threat of terrorism may demand a “tough and steady” presence on the ticket.  as a businessman and real estate developer, trump also likes the idea of teaming up with another non politician, the post reported. for weeks trump has conducted a high profile canvassing of republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket. a source familiar with the matter confirmed to reuters on saturday that flynn had emerged as a possibility. according to the source, flynn is seen as someone who would be able to help trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from islamic state militants. trump is also considering more conventional vice presidential contenders, such as former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich, indiana governor mike pence or new jersey governor chris christie.

" the head of the u.s. federal communications commission is expected to unveil his strategy this week to overturn landmark 2015 net neutrality rules, a move that will kickoff a new battle over the future of the internet. ajit pai, who was named chair of the fcc by president donald trump in january, will deliver a speech titled “the future of internet regulation” on wednesday in washington, the fcc said. sources said pai is expected to announce that he will begin the process of taking public comment to repeal the rules approved by the fcc under president barack obama in early 2015. the fcc could hold an initial vote on his proposal at the fcc’s may 18 meeting, the sources said. pai’s office declined to comment. the rules approved by the fcc in 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. the 2015 fcc rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. a federal appeals court upheld the rules last year. internet providers like at&t inc (t.n), verizon communications inc (vz.n) and comcast corp (cmcsa.o) have argued net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. advocacy group free press chief executive craig aaron said monday pai wants to hand over control of the internet to providers “no matter the cost to our economy and democracy.” pai, who opposed the net neutrality reclassification in 2015, has repeatedly said he backs a “free and open internet” but under a different regulatory scheme. some analysts have said fcc action to roll back net neutrality rules could put pressure congress to adopt legislation that clarifies the extent of fcc authority to regulate internet service. fcc commissioner mike o’rielly said on thursday that congress should adopt legislation to resolve the issue and determine “whether there should be rules.”      websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. democrats and privacy advocates have said net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open.    reuters and other news outlets reported in early april that pai was moving quickly to replace neutrality rules. pai told reporters thursday he has been meeting with major internet companies and trade groups to discuss ways of protecting an open internet.  “there’s common ground here and there’s room for an agreement here,” pai said. “going forward we want to make sure that we have a light touch regulatory framework.” it is not clear what alternative legal framework pai may endorse to guarantee an open internet. the internet association, a group representing facebook inc (fb.o), amazon.com inc (amzn.o), alphabet inc (googl.o) and others, met with pai this month and said “the internet industry is uniform in its belief that net neutrality preserves the consumer experience, competition, and innovation online,” according to a letter filed with the fcc.

" senate republicans mounted a concerted defense of one of president donald trump’s nominees to a federal appeals court on wednesday, suggesting a nonpartisan lawyers’ group rating of leonard steven grasz as “not qualified” for the bench was biased. during a senate judiciary committee hearing on grasz’s nomination, the republicans universally praised the nebraska lawyer, whom trump wants to fill a vacancy on the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals in st. louis.  negative assessments by the american bar association, which has been evaluating federal court picks for decades, are rare. it last gave an appeals court nominee a rating of “not qualified” in 2006. that nominee was withdrawn.  the aba’s 15 member standing committee on the federal judiciary voted unanimously on the poor rating for grasz, with one member abstaining. the report focused largely on grasz’s advocacy on conservative social issues, including his opposition to abortion rights. “many questioned whether mr. grasz would be able to detach himself from his deeply held social agenda,” pamela bresnahan, chair of the group’s judicial nominee vetting committee, said in a statement. on wednesday, republican senators questioned the credibility of the process. “they do a terrific job ordinarily, but sometimes they’re just ridiculous, and in your case i think they’re not only ridiculous, they’ve been political,” republican senator orrin hatch said, adding he would support grasz’s appointment.  the dustup over grasz comes as the full senate continues to confirm trump’s judicial choices amid republican complaints that democrats are obstructing the process. ten have been confirmed so far, including joan larsen, who was approved on wednesday to sit on the federal appeals bench in cincinnati.  the aba, the largest lawyers group in the united states, says its judicial evaluations are non partisan, taking into account experience, knowledge of the law and other factors, but not political or ideological views.  as nebraska’s former chief deputy attorney general, grasz defended the state’s “partial birth” abortion ban, among other laws.  grasz told the senators he would be bound to follow the supreme court’s abortion precedents. he said that during the second interview by the aba, “i was asked repeatedly for my personal opinions on social issues including abortion.” nebraska senator deb fischer, a republican, called the aba rating a “baseless political character assassination.” she claimed the two main evaluators both had ties with democrats.  bresnahan declined comment on wednesday. she will testify before the judiciary committee on nov. 15.

" hundreds of tunisians protested on saturday in the streets of the capital against a widely contested new law that grants  officials from the former regime involved in corruption amnesty from prosecution. tunisia s parliament on wednesday approved a law protecting officials accused of graft during the rule of autocrat zine el abidine ben ali, triggering angry protests by the opposition and activists. waving flags and banners saying  no to forgiveness ,  resisting against mafia rule , around 1,500 people marched through the capital s central avenue habib bourguiba in the company of opposition leaders. after months of protests, the law was amended from an original draft which would have also granted amnesty to corrupt businessmen. now they will be liable to prosecution for crimes committed during ben ali s 24 year rule. critics of the so called  economic reconciliation  law say it is a step back from the spirit of tunisia s 2011 revolution to oust ben ali, who fled after weeks of protests against corruption and inequality.  the counterrevolution is being led today by the president of the republic,  hamma hammami, leader of popular front party, told reuters.  the people returned to the streets again today as before the revolution and will not be silent against the corrupt system.  ruling parties ennahda and nidaa tounes supported the law. the law was proposed by president beji caid essebsi, himself a former ben ali official, and sent to parliament in 2015. but debate was postponed after criticism that the original bill benefited business elites tied to the government. government officials say the law helps to turn the page on the past, improves the climate for investment and gives confidence to the administration and officials. slim azzabi, the director of the president s office, said reconciliation would include about 2,000 employees and officials and will contribute to additional economic growth by 1.2 percent because of returned funds. despite the consensus between secular and islamist parties that helped the country s transition toward democracy, the bill has divided tunisians between those who want to draw a line under the past and those who say they must deal with past graft. since the 2011 uprising, tunisia has been held up by western partners as a model of democracy for the region. economic progress has lagged, though, and corruption remains a major problem in the north african state.

" iraq demanded on thursday that the u.s. government backtrack on a decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and summoned the u.s. ambassador in baghdad to protest the decision. u.s. president donald trump reversed decades of u.s. policy on wednesday and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel, imperiling middle east peace efforts and upsetting the arab world and western allies alike. shi ite majority iraq is the only country to have an alliance with regional powerhouse iran and the united states, who do not see eye to eye. the iraqi foreign ministry said it had summoned the u.s. ambassador in baghdad and that it would hand him a memo protesting trump s decision.  we caution against the dangerous repercussions of this  decision on the stability of the region and the world,  an iraqi government statement said.   the u.s. administration has to backtrack on this decision to stop any dangerous escalation that would fuel extremism and create conditions favorable to terrorism,  it said. iraq s top shi ite cleric grand ayatollah ali al sistani condemned the decision and called on the  umma , or islamic nation, to unite its efforts and reclaim jerusalem.  this decision is condemned and decried, it hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of arabs and muslims,  his office said in a statement.  but it won t change the reality that jerusalem is an occupied land which should return to the sovereignty of its palestinian owners no matter how long it takes,  it said. dozens of iraqis protested the decision in baghdad, carrying signs saying  jerusalem is arab  and vowing to return in greater numbers the following day after friday prayers. a prominent iraqi militia, the iran backed harakat hezbollah al nujaba, said trump s decision could become a  legitimate reason  to attack u.s. forces in iraq.  trump s stupid decision to make jerusalem a capital for the zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target american forces,  said the group s leader akram al kaabi. the united states is leading an international coalition helping iraq fight islamic state and has provided air and ground support. it has more than 5,000 troops in iraq. nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in iraq. though made up of iraqis, it is loyal to iran and is helping tehran create a supply route through iraq to damascus. it fights under the umbrella of the popular mobilisation forces (pmf), a mostly iranian backed coalition of shi ite militias that played a role in combating islamic state. the pmf is government sanctioned and formally reports to prime minister haider al abadi s office.

" the trump administration will be persistent in prosecuting white collar crimes despite giving a higher profile to tackling violent crime, a senior justice department official said on thursday. since taking office, u.s. attorney general jeff sessions has repeatedly said federal law enforcement agencies would focus on aggressively targeting violent criminals, especially drug trafficking gangs. that focus led some legal observers to believe the government “no longer is interested in prosecuting white collar crime,” trevor mcfadden, a deputy assistant attorney general at the justice department, told a conference of anti corruption lawyers in new york on thursday. “i intend to dispel that myth,” mcfadden said.      he said it makes “perfect sense” to devote more resources to the fight against violent crime given an increase in murder rates in some areas of the country, but that the justice department would not neglect prosecuting corporate criminals. he also said enforcement of laws against u.s. companies bribing overseas officials is “alive as ever”, although he added that federal prosecutors are not trying to “break our own records for the largest fines or longest prison sentences.”  “our aim is to motivate companies and individuals voluntarily to comply with the law.” violent crime rose around 5 percent in the united states last year, but remained near the lowest levels in decades, according to data from the federal bureau of investigation.

" u.s. president donald trump declined to say on wednesday whether he will visit the korean peninsula’s demilitarized zone during an upcoming asia tour. “i’d rather not say, but you’ll be surprised,” trump told reporters on the white house south lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to dallas.  trump is scheduled to depart on nov. 3 on a trip that includes visits to japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. his trip is expected to be heavily dominated by the nuclear and ballistic missile threat that north korea poses. the dmz is a border barrier between south and north korea and is a traditional stop for american dignitaries. white house officials say trump is to visit south korea’s camp humphreys during his visit to south korea to hail the u.s. south korean alliance.  there are no concerns about what message trump would send by not going to the dmz, a senior white house official told reporters on monday. “the message is that we are guests during a state visit of president moon jae in, who’s invited us to make a visit to camp humphreys. so we’ll keep talking with the south korean government to see if there are things that they want to adjust,” the official said.

" u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley on thursday called on countries to suspend providing weapons to myanmar over violence against rohingya muslims until the military puts sufficient accountability measures in place. it was the first time the united states called for punishment of military leaders behind the repression, but stopped short of threatening to reimpose u.s. sanctions which were suspended under the obama administration.  we cannot be afraid to call the actions of the burmese authorities what they appear to be   a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority,  haley told the u.n. security council, the first time washington has  echoed the u.n. s accusation that the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in rakhine state was ethnic cleansing. myanmar rejects the accusations and has denounced rights abuses.  the burmese military must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. those who have been accused of committing abuses should be removed from command responsibilities immediately and prosecuted for wrongdoing,  haley said.    and any country that is currently providing weapons to the burmese military should suspend these activities until sufficient accountability measures are in place,  haley said. myanmar national security adviser thaung tun said at the united nations on thursday there was no ethnic cleansing or genocide happening in myanmar. he told the security council that myanmar had invited u.n. secretary general antonio guterres to visit. a u.n. official said guterres would consider visiting myanmar under the right conditions.  china and russia both expressed support for the myanmar government. myanmar said earlier this month it was negotiating with china and russia, which have veto powers in the security council, to protect it from any possible action by the council. the trump administration has mostly hewed to former president barack obama s approach of forging warmer relations with myanmar, partly aimed at countering china s influence in the resource rich southeast asian country. meanwhile, international aid groups in myanmar have urged the government to allow free access to rakhine, where an army offensive has sent more than 500,000 people fleeing to bangladesh, but hundreds of thousands remain cut off from food, shelter and medical care. refugees are still leaving myanmar, more than a month after rohingya muslim insurgents attacked security posts near the border, triggering fierce myanmar military retaliation. aid groups said on thursday the total number of refugees in bangladesh was now 502,000. the myanmar government has stopped international aid groups and u.n. agencies from carrying out most of their work in the north of rakhine state, citing insecurity since the aug. 25 insurgent attacks. aid groups said in a joint statement they were:  increasingly concerned about severe restrictions on humanitarian access and impediments to the delivery of critically needed humanitarian assistance throughout rakhine state.    we urge the government and authorities of myanmar to ensure that all people in need in rakhine state have full, free and unimpeded access to life saving humanitarian assistance.  the government has put the myanmar red cross in charge of aid to the state, with the help of the international committee of the red cross. but the groups said they feared insufficient aid was getting through. relations between the government and aid agencies had been difficult for months, with some officials accusing the groups of helping the insurgents. aid groups dismissed the accusations, which they said had inflamed anger toward them among buddhists in the communally divided state, and called for an end to  misinformation and unfounded accusations . rights groups have accused the army of trying to push rohingya muslims out of myanmar, and of committing crimes against humanity. they have called for sanctions, in particular an arms embargo. united nations secretary general antonio guterres warned on thursday that the violence against rohingya muslims in the northern part of rakhine could spread to central rakhine, where 250,000 more people were at risk of displacement. guterres told the u.n. security council during its first public meeting on myanmar in eight years, that the violence had spiraled into the  world s fastest developing refugee emergency, a humanitarian and human rights nightmare.  a group of republican and democratic senators urged the trump administration on thursday to use the  full weight  of its influence to help resolve the rohingya crisis in myanmar and bangladesh. a letter seen by reuters and signed by four republican and 17 democratic members of the 100 seat senate also calls on secretary of state rex tillerson and u.s. agency for international development administrator mark green to provide more humanitarian aid. the british minister of state for asia and the pacific, mark field, described the situation as  an unacceptable tragedy  after visiting myanmar and meeting leaders including nobel laureate aung san suu kyi, who has faced scathing criticism and calls for her nobel prize to be withdrawn.  police in bangladesh said they recovered the bodies of 14 refugees, including nine children, who drowned when their boat capsized off the coast in bad weather. a reuters photographer said he saw several babies among the victims. the u.n. international organization for migration later put the toll at 15. police officer afrajul hoque tutu said three boats had capsized in heavy seas.     myanmar was getting ready to  verify  refugees who want to return, the government minister charged with putting into effect recommendations to solve problems in rakhine said. myanmar would conduct a  national verification process  at two points on its border with bangladesh under terms agreed during a repatriation effort in 1993, state media quoted win myat aye, the minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement, as saying. myanmar authorities do not recognize rohingya as an indigenous ethnic group, instead regarding them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh.  the government hates us,  said refugee zafar alam, 55, sheltering from rain near a refugee settlement in bangladesh, referring to the myanmar government.  i don t think i d be safe there. there s no justice.

" u.s. president barack obama chided vietnam on political freedoms on tuesday after critics of its communist run government were prevented from meeting him in hanoi, a discordant note on a trip otherwise steeped in amity between the former foes. tens of thousands turned out to welcome obama on the second leg of his visit, ho chi minh city, which was called saigon until april 1975 when north vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring u.s. backed south vietnam under communist rule. many in the crowds lining the streets chanted “obama, obama,” some held handwritten signs reading “obama, we love you,” and one woman held a boy dressed in a captain america costume, complete with shield. underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries, obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the trans pacific partnership (tpp) trade pact between 12 pacific rim countries. the high point of his visit came on monday, with an announcement that washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to vietnam. that clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over china’s military build up. critics said that by removing the ban, a vestige of the vietnam war, washington had put concerns about beijing’s assertiveness in the south china sea first and given up a critical lever to press hanoi for improvements in human rights. one prominent intellectual, nguyen quang a, told reuters that about 10 policemen had come to his house at 6:30 a.m. and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until obama was about to leave. an outspoken lawyer, ha huy son, said he was also stopped from joining obama’s meeting with six other civil society leaders. human rights watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on monday. quang a, a former it entrepreneur, was one of more than 100 vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekend’s election to the parliament, which is tightly controlled by the communist party. almost all failed to get on the ballot. before he was taken away, quang a posted on facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with obama, with the message: “before going. may be intercepted, arrested. advising so people know.” vietnam’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that, despite some “modest” legal reforms “there are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about.” “there are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government,” he said. u.s. officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for washington to engage with vietnam on such issues. in washington, members of the u.s. congress, including republicans as well as some of obama’s fellow democrats, criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen vietnamese human rights activists. “this is the definition of a bad deal,” republican representative chris smith said at a news conference. “this is not smart diplomacy, it is surrender of u.s. interests and values.” democratic representative adam lowenthal said, “i am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the vietnamese people.”  in a speech before leaving hanoi, obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the south china sea, where china has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors. “big nations should not bully small ones. disputes should be resolved peacefully,” he said, without naming china, which claims sovereignty over most of the south china sea. china’s global times, run by the communist party’s official people’s daily, said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing china. u.s. secretary of state john kerry, in ho chi minh city with obama, told reporters that washington’s efforts to normalize relations with vietnam were not aimed at china. “this is not about china. nothing that we did here or (are) arguing here is focused on china. it is focused on the fastest growing marketplace in the world,” kerry said.  obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at ho chi minh city’s “dreamplex,” which hosts budget tech start ups with support of angel investors and silicon valley funds. he also touted the benefits of the trans pacific partnership, especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation. vietnam’s manufacturing and export led economy is seen as the biggest tpp beneficiary. annual u.s. vietnam trade swelled to $45 billion last year from $450 million when ties were normalized. washington is a big buyer of vietnam’s televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. but the tpp, which would remove tariffs across a 12 nation bloc worth a combined $28 trillion of gross domestic product, is not a done deal. opposition is expected in washington amid concern about competition and a loss of u.s. jobs.

" u.s. republican presidential nominee donald trump, in remarks at an african american church on wednesday, praised “stop and frisk” policing methods that have aroused protests and successful legal challenges, for singling out minorities. the anti crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband, gained traction in new york city under mayor rudy giuliani, now a top trump supporter. but opposition to the practice led police departments in new york, as well as chicago and newark, new jersey, to agree to cut back on its use, in some cases submitting to outside monitoring and improving police training. “i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to,” trump said, according to excerpts of a fox news “town hall” in cleveland, after a listener asked what he would do to reduce crime in predominantly black communities across the nation. “i see what’s going on here, i see what’s going on in chicago, i think stop and frisk. in new york city it was so incredible, the way it worked,” he added.   ending the practice in new york was a key plank of democrat bill de blasio’s successful 2013 run for mayor. as the race between trump and democrat hillary clinton tightens ahead of the nov. 8 election, he has been reaching out to african american voters, shown by opinion polls to largely favor clinton. trump has portrayed himself as the “law and order candidate.” but clinton has criticized many of his proposals as unconstitutional attacks on american freedoms. clinton’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on trump’s statement. “stop and frisk” had saved lives and reduced crime in new york city under giuliani, the trump campaign said in a statement. “mr. trump believes that a locally tailored version of ‘stop and frisk’ should be used in chicago to help reduce skyrocketing violence and make our chicago safe again,” spokesman jason miller said. anger over police tactics has risen as their fatal encounters with african americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country. in his appeal to african american voters, trump has lamented the woes of black communities, asking those who traditionally vote democratic to take a chance on him. but his often dire portrayals of their lives have left some black voters unmoved.    connie tucker, a pastor at father heart ministries in columbus, ohio, said she liked policies that brought results, so if stop and frisk helped cut crime, she backed it. but tucker, who is white, said she sensed discomfort in the room at trump’s remarks. “i felt like there was a pause,” she said.      another attendee, geoff betts, 38, who is black, said he felt dismayed by trump’s response. betts, a hair products distributor, said he was registered to vote as an independent and attended to learn how trump would try to win over black voters.  he said he thought police unfairly discriminated against black citizens and that he opposed stop and frisk. “we are victims,” he said, adding that he had walked out of the meeting. “i just couldn’t take it anymore, i had to go. i don’t think that donald trump gets it.” ",0
" the u.s. environmental protection agency said that a freeze  handed down by president donald trump’s white house on new contracts and grants that has led to fears of delays in toxic pollution cleanups would be completely reversed on friday or at latest on monday.  the freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about potential delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution, particularly lead pollution in drinking water, that would put the health of americans at risk. the agency allocates nearly $4 billion annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing air and water for toxins. doug ericksen, a former washington state senator who is the epa’s new communications director, said in an email that $3.8 billion of the $3.9 billion in contracts and grants was cleared on wednesday night. “the remainder should be cleared today. there might be a very small number left for monday, but not likely.”  the epa has not issued any news releases about ending the freeze, which has led to uncertainty.  on thursday, a day after ericksen said the vast majority of the contracts and grants were cleared, five democratic senators, including edward markey and tom carper, wrote a letter to trump “with alarm” urging him to “immediately reverse this troubling action.”     ericksen said they should rest assured. “no projects are delayed or cut. none. not sure how much more clear i can be,” he said in the email.  u.s. representative dan kildee from flint, michigan, home to the lead poisoning crisis in drinking water, also wrote to trump this week asking when the freeze would be lifted. an epa spokeswoman told kildee’s office that $100 million in congressional aid would not be affected by the freeze. but kildee was uncertain whether contracts and grants centering on testing and expertise about the lead crisis would be delayed. a kildee spokesman said on friday that the congressman had still not gotten a written response to his letter from trump or the epa.  the epa sent employees an internal memo late on friday, seen by reuters that said it was making progress in lifting the freeze, which it called standard practice during a transition. “as of today, we have completed review of our grant programs,” the memo said. “the review of contracts is nearly complete, with very few contracts still under review,” the memo said, without elaborating.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson believes the diplomatic tiff between russia and the united states should not be escalated further and hopes the two countries can begin working to improve ties, a state department spokeswoman said on tuesday.  i think the secretary believes that no further escalatory action is necessary at this point and we look forward to trying to forge ahead,  state department spokeswoman heather nauert told a briefing after being asked the possibility of further diplomatic cuts by the two sides. nauert also noted that ambassador joseph yun, the u.s. special representative for north korean policy, was in moscow on tuesday for talks with russian officials about efforts to curb pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs.

" the united states  top negotiator with north korea arrived in south korea on tuesday, a visit that comes as hopes rise for an easing of tensions on the peninsula in the wake of u.s. president donald trump s visit and a lull in missile testing. special representative for north korea policy joseph yun will meet with south korean and international officials, according to the u.s. state department, although there is no indication his visit will include talks with the north. seoul s foreign ministry said yun is scheduled for talks with his south korean counterpart lee do hoon on friday on the sidelines of an international conference on disarmament, jointly hosted by the ministry and the united nations on the resort island of jeju.  south korea born yun has been at the heart of reported direct diplomacy in recent months with kim jong un s regime in north korea, which accelerated its program of nuclear and missile testing earlier this year. using the so called  new york channel,  he has been in contact with diplomats at pyongyang s united nations mission, a senior state department official told reuters in early november. even as trump called talks a waste of time, yun has quietly tried to lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand off in which each side shows little interest in compromise. in a speech to the council on foreign relations on oct. 30, yun reportedly said that if the north halts nuclear and missile tests for about 60 days, it would be a sign that washington needs to seek a restart of dialogue with pyongyang.  after several months of unprecedented testing earlier this year, north korea has not fired a rocket or tested a nuclear weapon since it launched a ballistic missile over japan on sept. 15. some analysts say it is too early to read much into the break in testing, which is the longest lull so far this year, but could align with seasonal cycles. and there is no sign that the behind the scenes communications have improved a relationship vexed by north korea s nuclear and missile tests as well as trump s heated statements.     during his visit to seoul last week, trump warned north korea he was prepared to use the full range of u.s. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged pyongyang to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff. trump also urged north korea to  do the right thing  and added that:  i do see some movement , though he declined to elaborate. while his comments seemed to reassure many in south korea, north korea s foreign ministry called trump a  destroyer of the world peace and stability,  and said his  reckless remarks  only made the regime more committed to building up its nuclear force.   trump muddied the water later on his asia visit by tweeting that north korean leader kim had insulted him by calling him  old  and said he would never call kim  short and fat . he also said  it would be very, very nice  if he and kim became friends.  it is indeed noteworthy that the president, at several junctures, seemed to open the door to negotiations with north korea,  said david pressman, a partner at the law firm boies schiller flexner who helped lead north korea sanctions negotiations as ambassador to the united nations under former president barack obama.  however, it is entirely unclear if the president s suggestions are reflective of a strategic shift or merely reflective of what the last person he happened to speak with about north korea said before the president made those comments.

" israeli players have been denied visas to participate in a speed chess championship hosted by saudi arabia this week, a vice president of the world chess federation (fide) said on sunday. seven israeli players had requested visas for the tournament on dec. 26 30. it would have marked the first time saudi arabia had publicly hosted israelis as the gulf state does not recognize israel and there are no formal ties between them. israel gelfer, vice president of fide, whose secretariat is based in athens, told reuters in an email that visas for the israeli players  have not been issued and will not be issued . he said the tournament would go ahead as planned. it was not immediately clear if other delegations had been excluded but players from qatar had suggested they may have been rejected. saudi arabia s center for international communication said in a statement that more than 180 players would participate but did not immediately respond to a request for comment. israel chess federation spokesman lior aizenberg said efforts were still being made  by various parties  to ensure the israeli players took part.  the event is not a world championship if they prevent chess players from several countries from taking part,  aizenberg told reuters.  every chess player should have the right to participate in an event on the basis of professional criteria, regardless of their passports, their place of issue or the stamps they bear.  aizenberg said fide should ensure israeli players could compete in international events and that the israeli federation was considering all options, including legal action and holding an international competition in israel for players excluded from the saudi match. fide had said in november it was undertaking a  huge effort  to ensure all players were granted visas.  (this version of the story was refiled to clarify that fide secretariat in athens, but unclear where gelfer speaking from) ",0
" some republican foreign policy veterans who came out against donald trump during the presidential campaign said on wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening. trump’s stunning upset over democrat hillary clinton has created a new dilemma for the republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own party’s candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. they must now decide whether to return to the fold. some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. however, state department spokesman mark toner said, “i wouldn’t expect a mass exodus.” about 150 of the republican party’s most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in march and august in outright opposition to trump’s candidacy. one said he was “utterly” unqualified for the white house. the other warned that he would be “the most reckless president in american history.” while neither letter said the former officials would never work for trump, their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow republicans from supporting him. trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of “the failed washington elite” who “deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.” a number of the signatories contacted by reuters on wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of trump and would not work for him. however, they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration, which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of syria’s civil war, the fight against islamic state, a newly assertive russia and the rise of china. “i don’t expect to be asked. i wouldn’t serve. but there are others who will. it will be a matter of individual conscience,” said eliot cohen, who served as counselor to former secretary of state condoleezza rice and helped spearhead the march letter, which was posted on a blog called war on the rocks and created a stir among republicans. “i’m concerned about his ignorance, the belligerence, the misunderstanding of how the world works,” cohen said of trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality tv host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward washington insiders. max boot, a foreign policy adviser to republican mitt romney’s 2012 presidential campaign and a supporter of the u.s. led iraq invasion in 2003, said: “i won’t have anything to do with trump, but i don’t know about others. i hope good people go into the government.” but others appeared to waver, with some saying decisions on whether to join the trump administration could depend on how the president elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts. among the trump allies said to be in consideration are former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and one time united nations ambassador john bolton for secretary of state, and general michael flynn, a former head of the defense intelligence agency, for national security adviser. dov zakheim, a former pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters, said trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs. “he will want to show that he is not dividing the republican party, so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him,” zakheim said. asked whether he expected to be offered a post, he said: “i have no idea, as it’s not up to me.” bryan mcgrath, a retired us navy officer and co organizer of the war on the rocks letter, said he did not expect that those who signed it “were signing away employment rights, that they weren’t going to work in a trump administration.” if the president asks for your service, he said, “you have to take that request seriously.” patrick cronin, an asia expert and former third ranking official at usaid under president george w. bush, said that despite his earlier opposition to trump, he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice. but he said he was not interested in joining the administration. michael mcfaul, president barack obama’s former ambassador to moscow and a clinton supporter in the election,  said the republicans had a “deep bench of experience” for enlisting foreign policy experts. even as trump prepares to form his foreign policy team, some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post election quandary. some said privately before tuesday’s vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under trump, who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning u.s. led alliances, praising russian president vladimir putin, suggesting that japan and south korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture. other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who he names to senior posts, saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president. “if he keeps some of his campaign promises, about the use of torture, for example, many of us have discussed whether we are honor bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside. it’s too early to say,” one cia officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

" ariana grande returned to the united states on tuesday, one day after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at the singer’s concert in manchester, england, as questions lingered over whether she would continue her european tour. grande, 23, was seen in photographs posted on the daily mail website walking down the steps of a private plane at an airport in her hometown of boca raton, florida, and being met by family members. the daily mail images showed the diminutive pop star dressed casually in sweats and appearing downcast as she greeted her boyfriend, the rapper mac miller, on the tarmac and getting into a waiting car. grande had not been seen publicly since an explosion ripped through the packed manchester arena at the end of her performance there. some of the 22 people who died in the attack were teens or young girls. grande was apparently unharmed. british police have identified the man suspected of carrying out the massacre as 22 year old salman abedi, who was born in manchester to parents of libyan origin. islamic state claimed responsibility for what it called revenge against “crusaders,” but there appeared to be contradictions in its account of the operation. in her only statement so far, grande took to twitter some five hours after the bombing to describe herself as “broken” in the aftermath of the attack. “from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’t have words,” she said in the tweet. grande was performing in manchester during the european leg of a tour to promote her third album, “dangerous woman,” which  also has her scheduled to visit london, belgium, poland, germany, switzerland and france in the coming weeks. despite speculation that she would cancel the rest of the tour, no formal announcement had been made as of tuesday.  grande’s manager, scooter braun, did not respond to requests for comment by reuters. “we mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act,” braun said in a statement posted on twitter on monday evening. “we ask all of you to hold the victims, their families and all those affected in your hearts and prayers.” grande, a native of boca raton, starred in the broadway musical “13” and on the nickelodeon tv series “victorious” before releasing her solo debut album, “yours truly.”  best known for her singles “problem” and “break free,” grande is credited with having an exceptionally broad vocal range for a pop star.

" philippines president rodrigo duterte will ask congress to extend martial law in the volatile southern island of mindanao to quell an insurgency, cabinet officials said on sunday. duterte placed the restive region of 22 million people under military rule on may 23 after islamist militants took over parts of the southern marawi city in what was the philippines  biggest security crisis in years. martial law is due to expire on dec. 31. the philippine leader will formally request on monday a one year extension of martial law, executive secretary salvador medialdea told reporters. the 23 member senate and the 296 member house of representatives will vote once they convene in joint session. lawmakers are due to go on recess on from dec. 16 to jan. 14, 2018. military rule should be extended in mindanao given threats from maoist guerrillas, islamist militants and separatist groups, presidential communications secretary martin andanar said. militants linked to islamic state, which tried to gain a foothold in southeast asia by capturing parts of marawi city, are strengthening their recruitment programs, andanar said.  there were intelligence reports saying they are planning to attack another city,  andanar told a radio interview. the request comes nearly two months after duterte declared the liberation of marawi city. more than 1,100 people   mostly militants   were killed and 350,000 displaced by the marawi unrest. continuing martial law beyond the initial 60 day limit requires lawmakers  approval, but the constitution does not restrict how long it can be extended.

" two minor tremors were detected on saturday from near north korea s nuclear test site and were probably aftershocks from the country s massive nuclear test in early september, a u.s. geological survey official said. the aftershocks, of magnitude 2.9 and 2.4, were detected at  0613 and 0640 gmt (1:13 a.m. and 1:40 a.m. est) respectively, said the usgs and lassina zerbo, executive secretary of the vienna based comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization. a tweet from zerbo said analysts had confirmed that the activity was  tectonic  in origin. the usgs official said the tremors had been in the vicinity of the punggye ri nuclear test site, where north korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on sept. 3.  they re probably relaxation events from the sixth nuclear test,  the official said.  when you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth s crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. we ve had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test.  pyongyang said the september test was of an h bomb, and experts have estimated it was 10 times more powerful than the u.s. atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945. a series of quakes since then has prompted experts and observers to suspect the test might have damaged the mountainous location of its site in the northwest tip of north korea, where all of the country s nuclear tests have been conducted. south korea s spy agency told south korean lawmakers in october that north korea might be readying two more tunnels at the site.  north korea hinted its next nuclear test could be above ground after u.s. president donald trump warned in september that the united states would  totally destroy  north korea if it threatened america. another possible obstacle to north korea s use of punggye ri for tests is the nearby active volcano of mount paektu, which north koreans consider a sacred site. its last eruption was in 1903, and experts have debated whether nuclear testing could trigger another. north korea s official media reported on saturday that national leader kim jong un had scaled mount paektu with senior military officials to  emphasize his military vision  after completion of the country s nuclear force. kim declared the nuclear force complete after the test of north korea s largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile last month, which experts said puts all of america within range.

" illinois’ two top republican legislators said on wednesday they will introduce legislation soon to let the state take over the cash strapped chicago public school system, permit the district to file for municipal bankruptcy and eventually allow for city wide school board elections. the plan has the backing of republican governor bruce rauner, who has embraced allowing local governments facing financial turmoil to file for bankruptcy. but it is strongly opposed by chicago mayor rahm emanuel, who controls the city’s schools, the chicago teachers union, and by democratic leaders, who control the legislature. senate minority leader christine radogno and house minority leader jim durkin, both republican allies of rauner, said a new approach is needed to rescue the chicago public schools (cps)from financial mismanagement and near collapse. rauner told reporters emanuel has failed to address the school district’s fiscal woes over the nearly five years he has been mayor.  “his message to us in state government has been for months, ‘we have a crisis. we need $500 million. we want the state to give it to us.’ that’s not a reasonable message. that’s not a reasonable request,” rauner said. the nation’s third largest school system has a structural budget deficit topping $1 billion and credit ratings that have fallen deep into the “junk” level.  the district’s current budget has a $480 million gap that officials hope to fill with bigger pension funding support from the state. but the plan has become entangled in a state budget stalemate between rauner and democrats.  the republicans’ plan would amend an existing law permitting state oversight of fiscally troubled schools to include cps and allow for an independent authority to run the district, while making it clear the state is not liable for school debt. once solvency is regained, an elected school board would take control.  the plan would also open the door to chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy while protecting general obligation bondholders with a statutory lien. “the mayor is 100 percent opposed to governor rauner’s ‘plan’ to drive cps bankrupt,” emanuel spokeswoman kelley quinn said in a statement, adding that the state has been shortchanging chicago students. house speaker michael madigan rejected the plan, pointing to michigan’s takeover of the city of flint, which has led to a health crisis from lead tainted water. “the disaster in flint, michigan, is a very timely example of how reckless decisions just to save a buck can have devastating consequences on children and families,” madigan said in a statement. senate president john cullerton, a chicago democrat, said the republicans’ “mean spirited” plan is not going to happen.  cps has scheduled an $875 million bond sale for next week, partly to free up revenue for its sagging budget.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump won a legal battle on sunday when a u.s. appeals court in ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that democrats had sought to prevent election day voter intimidation. the rules overturned by the sixth circuit court of appeals would have imposed greater penalties on people who harass voters during tuesday’s election. voter intimidation already is prohibited under u.s. law but democrats have pushed for greater restrictions in ohio and five other battleground states, citing concerns that trump’s heated rhetoric might inspire election day chaos. on the campaign trail, trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. numerous studies have found that u.s. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  on friday u.s. district court judge james gwin imposed new restrictions on those who monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go. those found to violate the rules could be held in contempt of court. the trump campaign had argued that those restrictions were not justified, given that there had been no reported instances of voter harassment in the state so far.  “in the end, plaintiff’s case rested on rhetoric, not evidence,” trump attorney chad readler wrote in a court filing on saturday. the appeals court sided with trump, lifting the new rules two days before election day. the ruling came before democrats had a chance to respond to readler’s motion and the party said it may appeal. “we are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the sixth circuit has done in this decision. we are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling,” ohio democratic party spokeswoman kirstin alvanitakis said. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" russia said on friday it was still likely to back the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change despite the u.s. withdrawal from the pact, but a kremlin aide said washington’s pull out left a gaping hole in the deal.   russia has signed the paris climate pact but is the biggest emitter of global greenhouse gases not to have yet ratified it. russian officials have said they need more time to assess its potential impact on their economy and have spoken of drafting a strategy for low carbon development, fuelling fears among green campaigners moscow may not ratify the agreement.   deputy prime minister arkady dvorkovich said on friday he did not think that u.s. president donald trump’s decision to pull his country out of the agreement would prompt russia to rethink its own stance however.    “we made the decision to join, and i don’t think we will (change) it,” the ria news agency cited dvorkovich as telling reporters at an economic forum in st petersburg. “the deal simply amounts to a signal about the unity of countries around a certain theme. i don’t think anyone doubts that the americans will make environmental policy. we will definitely do this (make environmental policy) regardless of whether we are part of the agreement or not,” he added.   separately, kremlin aide andrei belousov told reporters at the same event that the u.s. withdrawal punched a gaping hole in the pact, rendering it unworkable. belousov said russia was analyzing the u.s. move, but said russia’s own plans did not depend on the decision of others, including the united states.  “i think it’s a great shame because decisions that have been taken should not be changed,” he said of the u.s. withdrawal. “it’s obvious that without the participation of the united states the paris agreement will be unworkable because the united states is one of the biggest generators of emissions.” president vladimir putin’s spokesman said on thursday that moscow attached “great significance” to the deal despite anything the united states might do.

" white house officials said on friday they did not know yet whether president donald trump would seek to block former fbi director james comey from testifying to congress next week, a move that could spark a political backlash. “i have not spoken to counsel yet. i don’t know how they’re going to respond,” white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters. comey was leading a federal bureau of investigation probe into alleged russian meddling in last year’s u.s. presidential election and possible collusion by trump’s campaign when the president fired him last month. critics have charged that trump was seeking to hinder the fbi’s investigation by dismissing comey. the former fbi chief is due to testify on thursday before the senate intelligence committee as part of its own russia related investigation, and his remarks could cause problems for the republican president. comey is widely expected to be asked about conversations in which the president reportedly pressured him to drop an investigation into trump’s former national security adviser, michael flynn, whose ties to russia are under scrutiny. critics have said that such pressure could potentially amount to obstruction of justice. presidents can assert executive privilege to prevent government employees from sharing information. however, legal experts say it is not clear whether certain conversations between trump and comey that the president has talked about publicly would be covered, and any effort to block comey, who is now a private citizen, from testifying could be challenged in court. democratic lawmakers sent white house counsel donald mcgahn a letter warning that invoking executive privilege “would be seen as an effort to obstruct the truth from both congress and the american people.”  in an interview with abc news, white house senior adviser kellyanne conway appeared to indicate the president would allow comey to testify. “we’ll be watching with the rest of the world when director comey testifies,” she said. but asked directly whether trump would invoke executive privilege on comey’s testimony, she added: “the president will make that decision.” amid a political firestorm touched off by comey’s firing, the justice department appointed a special counsel last month to take the lead on the russia investigation. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded the russian government sought to influence the u.s. election in trump’s favor, a charge russia has denied. russian president vladimir putin, however, said on thursday some russians may have acted on their own. trump, who has raised doubts about the u.s. agencies’ findings and denounced the continuing russia probes, has denied any collusion.

" president barack obama will ensure that federal officials are held accountable if any wrongdoing is uncovered in the u.s. environmental protection agency’s handling of the water contamination crisis in flint, michigan, the white house said on thursday. “the president believes that the principle of accountability is important, particularly when the stakes are this high,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters at a briefing.  noting that the justice department was investigating the contamination of flint’s water supply, earnest said obama will make sure that epa officials are held responsible for any “errors or wrongdoing” that may be uncovered. obama on wednesday said it was “inexplicable and inexcusable” that families in flint were not immediately notified about the contaminated water. federal and local government agencies have faced criticism for their response to the crisis in flint, where a switch in water supply for the cash strapped city of 100,000 north of detroit led to elevated levels of lead in drinking water. high levels of lead in the blood can cause brain damage and other health problems.  while the obama administration has repeatedly stressed oversight of the flint’s water was primarily the responsibility of state and local authorities, the epa has said it did not act fast enough to address the problem. complaints about flint’s water began within a month after the city switched to flint river water in april 2014 to save money. the city had been using the lake huron as its water source.  flint did not return to the lake huron water supply until october 2015, after tests showed elevated levels of lead in flint tap water and in some children.

" donald trump on friday named u.s. senator mike lee as a potential supreme court nominee, turning to an ally of former rival ted cruz in an apparent gesture to conservative republicans who have been wary of the republican presidential candidate.  lee was included on a new list of 21 potential supreme court justices that trump would consider for the high court if he is elected over democrat hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. “this list is definitive and i will choose only from it in picking future justices of the united states supreme court,” trump said in a statement. the announcement came out on a day in which neither candidate had a public event and were preparing for monday’s first presidential debate. the list trump announced included 10 new names and 11 conservative jurists from a list the new york businessman had announced in may. lee’s brother, thomas lee, an associate justice of the utah supreme court, was on the initial list and remains on trump’s expanded list. trump’s listing of mike lee amounted to a gesture to u.s. senator cruz of texas, a conservative who fought trump fiercely as a rival for the republican presidential nomination and who has refused to endorse trump. trump’s bombastic style and proposals breaking with some conservative orthodoxies such as support for free trade agreements have sparked unease among traditional conservative republicans.  mike lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “right now i’m focused on my job in the senate, where i’m in a good position to defend the constitution by fighting against government overreach. both lists that i’ve seen from the trump campaign are fantastic.  “while my brother and i might disagree as to which list is better, they’re both great,” he quipped. the death of conservative justice antonin scalia on feb. 13 left the court with a four to four tie between right leaning and left leaning justices. democratic president barack obama has nominated merrick garland, chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals in washington, but the republican controlled u.s. senate has refused to consider confirming him. trump said his list was based on who would follow constitutional principles on the high court. the possibility of republicans ceding control of the court to the democrats has been one of his main rallying cries at campaign events. others on trump’s list include keith blackwell, a justice on the supreme court of georgia; charles canady, a florida supreme court justice; neil gorsuch, a judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit, and edward mansfield, an iowa supreme court justice. other names included federico moreno, a judge of the u.s. district court for the southern district of florida; margaret ryan, a judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces; amul thapar, a judge of the u.s. district court for the eastern district of kentucky; timothy tymkovich, chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the 10th circuit; and robert young, chief justice of the supreme court of michigan.

" romanian lawmakers voted on tuesday to enact judicial changes that critics say will undermine graft investigations by weakening the president s oversight. the move brings the country, ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, in line with eastern european union peers hungary and poland in defying eu concerns over the independence of judiciaries and the rule of law. ruling social democrat senators approved the bill by 80 0 with all opposition groupings boycotting the vote. it now goes to the president, who has expresses scepticism about it. he can sign it or send it back for more discussion. the opposition, however, has already said it plans to contest the bill at the constitutional court, which could prolong its adoption by early 2018. contested elements of the bill include weakening the president s right to vet prosecutor candidates, as well as amending the definition of prosecutors  activity to exclude the word  independent.   the president can refuse to appoint (prosecutors) only once...,  reads the bill.  prosecutors carry out their work according to the principles of legality, impartiality, hierarchical control, under the authority of justice minister. prosecutors are independent in proposing solutions,  the bill stipulates. critics say this amounts to political control. the bill also refers to the finance ministry s obligation to recoup losses triggered by a judicial error from the judge who issued the sentence, instead of from state funds. experts have said this would could distort court judgments. the bill is are part of a wider judiciary overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks. romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on graft in recent years. the lower house and senate speakers, both leaders of the ruling coalition, are on trial in separate cases.

" prospects dimmed on monday for the u.s. house of representatives to vote this week on republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before congress goes on a seven week summer break.  republicans including house speaker paul ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the june 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in orlando, florida. congress begins a summer recess on friday. but with the house floor schedule filling with other bills, republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before september, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   representative jim jordan of ohio, who heads the conservative house freedom caucus, said, “i do not anticipate that bill.” the measure, backed by the national rifle association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. but ryan has been unable to win support from conservative republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. but the measure did not come up at a monday meeting with republican leaders to discuss the week’s agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   the stalemate leaves hanging democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25 hour sit in by house democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. “a vote is going to be stalled” until congress returns from its long summer break, one republican aide said. lawmakers initially believed congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of americans in favor of greater restrictions.

" six more u.s. senators signed on to support a sweeping republican tax bill on friday, leaving only one known republican opponent   bob corker   and virtually assuring the measure would pass despite democratic opposition. a vote was expected later friday. here are the republican senators who have been pivotal to the bill’s fate. corker, a deficit hawk from tennessee, said on friday he could not vote for the senate legislation because of fiscal concerns. in a statement, he said he believed the tax overhaul “could deepen the debt burden on future generations.” corker had stalled momentum on the tax bill on thursday by demanding republicans look for more ways to keep the bill from causing the u.s. deficit to balloon. he said friday he felt it would have been fairly easy to alter the measure in a way that would have been more fiscally sound, but “unfortunately, it is clear that the (republican) caucus is in a different place.” however, corker said he had told president donald trump in a phone call friday that he would take a close look at the final version of the bill, expected to be produced by a house senate conference, before deciding how to vote on it. the joint committee on taxation estimated on thursday that the republican bill would expand the national debt by $1 trillion over 10 years, far short of assertions by republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. the moderate senator from maine announced friday she will support the tax bill after securing several improvements in the text and getting assurances that other legislation would be advanced to help lower health insurance premiums. collins dislikes a clause in the bill repealing a fee imposed on people who do not comply with obamacare’s “individual mandate” to obtain health insurance. she said she worried that repealing this fee would drive up insurance premium costs, canceling out gains from tax cuts that many constituents might get from the bill. she said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had pledged to help mitigate the effect of the repeal by supporting passage of two other healthcare bills before the end of the year. one would help insurers cover expensive patients; the other would continue obamacare subsidy payments for low income people for two years. collins also got three amendments included in the tax bill, including one to keep the state and local property tax deduction of up to $10,000 from federal income tax. this would mirror legislation already passed by the house of representatives. the montana republican signed on to support the bill friday after having voiced concerns about its treatment of “main street” businesses. he said he had won more tax relief for non corporate pass through businesses, which include partnerships, sole proprietorships and other non corporate enterprises. the senator from wisconsin endorsed the bill after  demanding more for pass throughs. the bill now features a 23 percent tax deduction for such business owners, up from the original 17.4 percent, said statements from daines and johnson. the arizona conservative announced in a statement on friday he would vote for the bill. he said he had succeeded in eliminating an $85 billion expensing “budget gimmick” and received a firm commitment from senate leaders and the trump administration to work on permanent protections for immigrants who were brought to the united states illegally as children.  oklahoma’s lankford came aboard on friday after having questioned whether tax revenues from economic growth would compensate for an expected increase in the national debt. he announced on friday he was voting for the bill. moran had earlier been wary of its impact on the debt.     the arizona maverick and former presidential candidate announced on thursday that he would back the tax bill. the senator from alaska will vote for the tax bill, she wrote on twitter on wednesday evening.

" quality problems prompted two of michigan governor rick snyder’s top lawyers to urge that flint be moved back to the detroit water system just months after a decision to draw water supply from the flint river, according to emails released on friday. several critics have called for snyder to resign over concerns about the state’s poor handling of the crisis, and the governor said friday he felt regret every day.  flint switched its water supply from detroit to the flint river in april 2014 in a bid to cut costs when the city was under a state appointed emergency manager.  while the city switched its water source back to detroit in october 2015, corrosive water from the river had already leached lead from city pipes, posing a serious threat to public health. snyder’s aides discussed flint’s water quality problems as early as autumn 2014, with one calling the situation “downright scary,” about a year before the switch back to the detroit system was finally made. the detroit free press and detroit news earlier reported about the emails, which were released by the governor’s office. “that’s where i’m kicking myself every day,” snyder said after signing a $30 million supplemental bill to reimburse flint residents for their water bills. “i wish i would have asked more questions.”       snyder, scheduled to testify to congress on march 17, has repeatedly apologized for the state’s poor handling of the crisis.  liberal group progress michigan again called for snyder to resign, citing the emails. “there’s no reasonable person who can believe at this point that every top adviser to rick snyder knew that there was an issue, but snyder knew nothing,” said executive director lonnie scott, who also called for snyder’s resignation. valerie brader, snyder’s senior policy adviser, addressed problems over the quality of flint river water in an email to the governor’s chief of staff, dennis muchmore, and others on oct. 14, 2014.  she argued flint should be returned to the detroit water system, citing bacterial contamination and reduced quality that prompted general motors to switch away from the river due to rusted car parts. michael godola, then the governor’s legal counsel, responded, calling the flint river as a water source “downright scary.” on friday, state representative sheldon neeley of flint asked attorney general bill schuette for his legal opinion on whether an official withholding information that leads to death or harm can be charged criminally.",0
" when the u.s. congress returns from summer vacation on tuesday, for the first time in years gutting obamacare will not be the main order of business on the healthcare agenda.  but leftover hard feelings in the wake of the long, partisan obamacare wars could poison other issues. among them will be a measure to keep federal funding flowing to an insurance program that helps millions of children and pregnant women. the children’s health insurance program (chip) must be reauthorized by a vote of congress by sept. 30. if that does not happen, the program is expected to run out of money. another issue will be stabilizing the individual insurance market created under the 2010 affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. in recent months, the trump administration has worked to undermine it and insurers have raised premiums by double digits or exited the market. republicans in congress spent six months trying to make good on a seven year campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare, also a top campaign promise by president donald trump, while democrats remained unanimously opposed.  the effort, which inflamed partisanship and exposed deep divisions within the republican party, ended with a dramatic failed senate vote in july, leaving the law in place, but damaged.  reauthorization of chip is typically not contentious. the program has bipartisan support. but lobbyists and industry officials said that any healthcare effort in congress could become partisan in this political climate. “anything having to do with healthcare after the process we’ve gone through is subject to being controversial,” one health industry lobbyist said last week.  serving as a backdrop for congress’ deliberations, including hearings scheduled for wednesday and thursday, will be trump and his twitter account. in several tweets, trump has chastised lawmakers, sometimes by name, for failing to deliver on their promise to get rid of obamacare. if that continues, already rocky relations between trump and fellow republicans could worsen. several congressional aides, lobbyists and industry officials said they were skeptical that lawmakers would be able to move past the bitter months long republican push to gut obamacare and somehow achieve bipartisan cooperation on healthcare. the obamacare markets’ problems have worsened amid conflicting messages from trump and the republicans’ effort to dismantle the healthcare law. republican aides and lobbyists said there was little appetite to try once more to repeal and replace it. they said republicans, controlling the white house, house of representatives and senate, were unlikely to take up the repeal and replace effort for the remainder of 2017. trump’s administration has moved to undercut obamacare, slashing its advertising budget by 90 percent and backing off enforcement of the so called individual mandate, the requirement that everyone purchase insurance or pay a fine.

" british prime minister theresa may is expecting a  constructive  meeting in brussels on monday with senior european union officials as part of her attempt to achieve a smooth exit from the bloc, her spokesman said on monday.  may will meet eu commission head jean claude juncker and chief brexit negotiator michel barnier at 1630 gmt for talks over dinner after deadlock in brexit talks appeared to dash her hopes that an eu leaders  summit later this week could launch negotiations on future trade ties. the meeting comes after may attempted to revive talks last month in a speech in florence, where she promised britain would honor its eu commitments.  this is about reflecting upon florence and the constructive way it s been received and that we want to continue to move forward in a constructive manner,  the spokesman told reporters. when asked if may would flesh out details of what britain is prepared to offer in terms of a financial settlement, the spokesman said:  the pm set out her position in the florence speech in relation to the settlement, and that s where we are.  may will also speak to french president emmanuel macron and irish prime minister leo varadkar on monday, the spokesman said.

" north korea does not want to start a nuclear war and the world is not seeking to overthrow its leader kim jong un, the u.n. disarmament chief said on tuesday. izumi nakamitsu, u.n. high representative for disarmament affairs, said there was hope for a peaceful end to the tension  caused by the nuclear ambitions of north korea, also known as democratic people s republic of korea (dprk).  i don t think dprk wants to start a nuclear war,  she told a news conference in geneva. on monday, the u.n. security council unanimously decided to step up sanctions on north korea after its sixth and largest nuclear test, prompting a war of words between diplomats at the conference on disarmament in geneva.  asked if the pressure on north korea was pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, nakamitsu said u.n. officials were in touch with all sides and nobody   including north korea   saw a military solution to the crisis.  that is just too catastrophic,  she said.  i think we all understand the consequences of a military escalation, a  military solution . that s why we keep saying that it would not be a solution for anyone, including dprk.  she added:  maybe i m missing something but as far as i hear, no one is really asking for any collapse of dprk, quite the contrary. no one is talking about regime change, quite the contrary.  she was also hopeful that, as in the past, increased nuclear tensions might yield progress in disarmament talks.  when people say that because the international security environment is so difficult, tensions are so high, that we can t discuss disarmament, that is historically not accurate.  u.n. secretary general antonio guterres has offered to play a role in mediating, as has switzerland. so far no such steps have been taken, but the united nations was prepared to get involved if asked to do so, nakamitsu said.  we are definitely preparing ourselves, exploring scenarios as part of our normal contingency planning.

" a summit of euro zone leaders will go ahead as planned in the middle of december, the chairman of european union leaders said on wednesday, dispelling speculation it might be postponed because of the collapse of german coalition talks.  just to be clear: the december euro summit is on. as part of the leaders  agenda we need to discuss what, how and when to move forward on the emu (european monetary union) and the banking union,  tusk said on twitter. he said he discussed the agenda of the meeting over the phone on wednesday with the chairman of euro zone finance ministers jeroen dijsselbloem. german government coalition talks collapsed on sunday night as the liberal fdp party pulled out after weeks of  exploratory  talks, plunging the euro zone s most important economy into political uncertainty and raising the prospect of new elections. euro zone leaders are to set a direction for deeper euro zone economic integration at a summit in the middle of december, at which germany s input is crucial. the summit is to launch six months of work that would lead decisions in june 2018 on whether or not the single currency area should have a budget, a finance minister and a separate euro zone assembly within the european parliament. the deeper integration push, championed by french president emmanuel macron, also includes the transformation of the euro zone bailout fund into a european monetary fund and the creation of a sovereign insolvency mechanism.

" a foreign policy adviser to u.s. republican candidate donald trump has accused washington of contributing to an atmosphere of mutual contempt with moscow by disregarding russia’s interests. carter page, a former investment banker whose views on russia have caused controversy in the past, made the comments in an opinion piece for russia’s state controlled sputnik news agency that was published on thursday. “from syria to ukraine to world energy policy, russia remains an essential piece in the puzzle for solving many of washington’s most pressing geostrategic challenges,” page wrote in the article. the u.s. government had shown a “complete disregard for russia’s interests”, page said, saying this had fueled a sharp deterioration in bilateral relations. trump, the republican nominee for next month’s u.s. election, named page as being among five foreign policy advisers in march. both trump and page are known for their more conciliatory stance toward russia, in contrast to the views of many prominent republicans. in a speech in moscow in july, page criticized western countries for what he said was their “hypocritical focus on democratization” in the post soviet world.

" hillary clinton told a majority black church in north carolina on sunday that she knows her grandchildren are growing up in a different world than many black youth in the u.s. who are concerned about police shootings and gun violence in their communities. the democratic presidential nominee’s remarks at the little rock ame zion church in charlotte were a frank acknowledgment of the impact of what she has called “implicit bias” in policing can have on black communities. clinton cited the death of 43 year old keith scott, a black man who was shot by police in front of a charlotte apartment complex on sept. 20. she also lamented the death of 40 year old terence crutcher, who was shot days before during a tulsa traffic stop. both shootings led to community protests. the tulsa police officer has pleaded not guilty to a manslaughter charge. “i’m a grandmother, and like every grandmother, i worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,” clinton said. clinton described testimony that taje gaddy, 10, and zianna oliphant, 9, gave last week before the charlotte city council about violence in their community. clinton later summoned oliphant to join her on the stage. “i wouldn’t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. but because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let’s be honest here, they won’t face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council,” clinton said. clinton has made gun violence a focus of her presidential campaign. mothers who have lost children in shootings have joined her on the campaign trail. clinton has said police officers should be trained to recognize implicit bias and called for the official police video of the charlotte shooting to be released. donald trump, the republican nominee, said at a rally after crutcher’s shooting that it looked like he had done “everything he was supposed to do.”  on twitter, he criticized clinton’s trip to charlotte, which was postponed one week at the behest of the city’s mayor, as a chance to “grandstand.” (this version of the story was refiled to fix typographical error in paragraph 1, changes to “police” shootings and corrects typo in headline)  ",0
" among the few certainties in the current u.s. political environment are that immigration will be a flashpoint, abortion will remain divisive and texas will sue the administration of president barack obama. since obama, a democrat, took office in january 2009, the most populous republican controlled state has filed suit against his administration 39 times. on tuesday, the u.s. supreme court agreed to take on one of the more notable cases and decide the legality of obama’s unilateral 2014 action to shield from deportation more than 4 million immigrants in the country illegally. for texas politicians, suing obama is a badge of honor. its attorney general’s office has an annual budget of more than $600 million, more than five times higher than other major republican strongholds such as arizona. current governor greg abbott sued the obama administration 31 times when he was attorney general. current attorney general ken paxton, who succeeded abbott last year, has sued eight times.  “i am enjoying being governor of texas but there is one thing that i miss. it is that i no longer get to wake up and go to the office and sue the federal government,” abbott told a conservative forum this month in austin. no other republican state comes close to the number of such filings and often they join texas led suits, as happened with the immigration filing that now has attracted 25 other states. for texas, whose $1.6 trillion a year economy is bigger than many countries including u.s. ally south korea, spending on suits against the federal government is comparatively miniscule, at around $5.1 million as of december 2014, the texas tribune reported, based on disclosures it received from the office.  the office is a powerful machine with more than a million legal hours billed to litigation and counseling, according to its budget report.  the attorney general’s office of the solicitor general boasts nearly 20 lawyers who specialize in appellate work in venues like the u.s. supreme court, the supreme court of texas and the new orleans based 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals.  there is also a litigation division of about 30 lawyers with which the solicitor general can team up and present cases such as the one on obama’s executive action on immigration.  texas loses more often than it wins and it has a great deal of litigation still pending before judges that may outlast obama’s presidency, which ends in january 2017. under paxton, texas has sued the federal government on issues including u.s. environmental protection agency regulations, taxes under obama’s signature healthcare law and blocking the resettlement of syrian refugees in the state. texas is a lead party in the two biggest cases before the u.s. supreme court during its current term, which ends in june. in addition to the immigration case, texas is defending a state law being challenged by abortion providers that contend the republican backed statute is aimed at shutting clinics that perform the procedure. the high court is due to hear arguments in the abortion case on march 2 and is expected to hear the immigration arguments the following month. “texas, being an economically and demographically important state, is a natural to take a leadership role if there is a challenge to federal power that a lot of states want to make,” said matthew wilson, a political science professor at southern methodist university in dallas. the lawsuits often follow a similar philosophical idea of challenging what texas and other republican governed states see as an overreach of federal power at the expense of states’ rights, he added. “we don’t just represent texas. you can call it ‘red state america’ or ‘tea party america,’ but texas is a voice for a lot of those people nationally,” said chip roy, a top official in the attorney general’s office who once served as chief of staff for texas senator ted cruz, a leading candidate for the republican presidential nomination in november’s election.  cruz, a former u.s. supreme court clerk, helped bolster his political career when he served as texas solicitor general from 2003 to 2008. he ramped up the office under republican former governor rick perry and helped forge challenges to what the state saw as federal overreach.  “we are proud to have texas leading the charge in defending the rule of law,” cruz said on tuesday after the supreme court announced it would hear the immigration case. roy said in an interview the state’s leaders and a majority of its citizens want to protect the ideal of governing themselves. “it is part of who we are,” roy said, “and that actually influences significantly our willingness, and our drive, to push back on washington when we believe they are overstepping their constitutional authority.” ",0
" peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski has thwarted a bid in congress to force him out over a graft scandal, as an opposition lawmaker accused him of securing votes by promising to free ex president alberto fujimori from jail. before thursday evening s vote on a motion to push him out, kuczynski urged lawmakers to set aside unproven allegations of graft against him to defend peru from what he called a coup attempt by the right wing popular force party. popular force emerged from the populist movement started in the 1990s by fujimori, who is now serving a 25 year sentence for corruption and human rights crimes. kuczynski s government had denied that a pardon would be part of a political negotiation. but popular force lawmaker cecilia chacon told reporters that the government had promised a faction of her party that fujimori would be pardoned if it backed him. the bulk of popular force, led by fujimori s daughter keiko fujimori, sought to depose kuczynski as  morally unfit  to govern after discovering business ties he once had with a firm at the center of the region s biggest graft scandal. but the party, which last week mustered 93 votes to begin proceedings, failed to secure the 87 needed to pass the motion, thanks to 10 popular force abstentions. the vote capped a week of political turmoil in one of latin america s most stable and robust economies, also the world s second biggest copper producer. television images showed kuczynski, a 79 year old former wall street banker, dancing a jig amid cheering supporters outside his home in lima s financial district.  tomorrow a new chapter in our history begins: the reconciliation and rebuilding of our country,  he tweeted. but kuczynski s political troubles might not be over. popular force has vowed to continue to investigate deposits totaling $4.8 million that brazilian builder odebrecht made to consultant firms owned by kuczynski or a close business associate of his over a decade, starting in 2004. odebrecht has rocked latin american politics with its confession exactly a year ago that it bribed officials across the region, landing elites in jail from colombia to the dominican republic.  kuczynski once denied having any professional ties to the company, and has since said he was unaware of the transactions but that there was nothing improper about them. kuczynski took office promising that his decades of experience in finance and public administration would help usher in an era of clean government and robust growth. but his first 16 months in power have been marked by clashes in congress, where popular force has helped oust four ministers. his triumph on thursday was the first clear sign that he might be able to exploit a family feud in popular force to defend his government from congress. keiko fujimori faces competition from her younger brother kenji for leadership of their father s following. hours before the vote, kenji threw his support behind kuczynski in a video, without specifying who else he spoke for, saying:  we re going to prioritize making the president s administration stronger.  kenji has been more vocal than his sister in calling for a presidential pardon for their father. alberto fujimori remains a divisive figure. while some considered him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and leftist rebellion in the 1990s.     congresswoman chacon, loyal to keiko, said the abstainers had been swayed by the government.  they ve spoken to several of them, offering to free president fujimori,  she said.  let s see if they follow through with it.  after the vote, kenji shared a clip from the movie  the lion king , saying only:  the time has arrived.  many interpreted the post to mean a pardon was pending. kuczynski s government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. hours before the vote, prime minister mercedes araoz had denied that the government would trade a pardon for fujimori in exchange for votes.  that s not something that s negotiated,  she told a news conference. a justice ministry spokesman said alberto fujimori had sent kuczynski s presidential pardons committee a request last week to free him by reducing his prison sentence. the person who filed the request was one of the popular force lawmakers loyal to kenji who cast an abstention. prior to the political crisis, kuczynski said he would make a decision on a pardon for fujimori by the end of the year.

" thailand officially ended a year of mourning for its late king bhumibol adulyadej on monday, marking a return to colors for some after a monotone year during which many wore black from head to toe out of respect for their revered monarch. hundreds of thousands of people thronged bangkok s historic quarter to bid farewell last week to king bhumibol, who died in october 2016. his $90 million dollar funeral, full of pomp and ancient ritual, took place over five days. his remains were brought to their final resting place within bangkok s grand palace on sunday. portraits of the bespectacled late king, who became a father figure for many during a seven decade reign, were hung across thailand. the black and white funeral bunting that had hung on the gates of bangkok s government house for a year was taken down on monday and prime minister prayuth chan ocha made a televised announcement to mark the official end of the mourning period.  the government would like to thank officials, both soldiers and civilians ... and the more than 10 million thais who came to pay respects to the royal body over the past year,  prayuth said. may kanokwattana, 29, an office worker, wore bright yellow as she waited at the siam bts, a major bangkok transport interchange.  i wore black for one year. i needed to show my sorrow. today is the first day i am wearing a different color,  may told reuters. she also wore a pin with the thai number nine out of respect for king bhumibol, who was also known as the ninth king of the chakri dynasty. colors have a profound meaning for thais. astrological rules followed by many in the southeast asian nation assign a color to each day of the week. king bhumibol was born on a monday, a day associated with the color yellow. his only son, new king maha vajiralongkorn, was also born on a monday. some people shared charts on social media showing which colors would be considered luckiest to wear.  for confidence, health and power wear orange. for good support wear pale green,  said one chart. pattinya mankongwongcharoen, 49, an accountant wearing a peach colored dress, said:  i won t continue wearing black because the mourning period is officially over and to do so would be disrespectful.  others said they would continue to wear muted colors.  i m still grieving. i ll wear black or gray for a few more weeks,  said pimsuda chatree, 37, a shop owner.

" president barack obama selected merrick garland for the u.s. supreme court on wednesday, choosing a centrist judge meant to win over recalcitrant senate republicans whose leaders wasted no time in spurning the democratic president. a bruising political fight is brewing over the nomination, which also promises to figure in the already contentious campaign for the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. the republican led senate’s leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up or down vote on any obama nominee. garland, 63, was picked to replace long serving conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. a chicagoan like obama, he serves as chief judge of the influential u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and is a former prosecutor who in the past has won praise from both republicans and democrats. wasting no time in pressing its case for senate confirmation, the administration is dispatching garland to capitol hill on thursday to huddle with senator patrick leahy of vermont, the senior judiciary committee democrat and then with senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada. such meetings are aimed at shoring up senate support for the nominee and generating media coverage. the lifetime appointment to the high court requires senate confirmation. obama’s announcement prompted a flood of reaction from private groups that will work to advance or kill the nomination. the uaw, representing automobile, aerospace and some agricultural workers, call garland “a distinguished, moderate judge with more federal judicial experience than any other supreme court nominee in history.” national rifle association executive director chris cox said, “a basic analysis of merrick garland’s judicial record shows that he does not respect our fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self defense.”   republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the presidential election, are demanding that obama leave the seat vacant and let his successor, to be sworn in next january, make the selection. billionaire businessman donald trump is leading among republicans for the nomination. obama’s former secretary of state, hillary clinton, is the front runner for the democrats. obama said republican senators should give garland a fair hearing. he said that failing to do so “will not only be an abdication of the senate’s constitutional duty, it will indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair.” such a move, he said, would also undermine the reputation of the supreme court and faith in the american justice system. “our democracy will ultimately suffer as well,” obama added, as he introduced garland at a white house rose garden ceremony. scalia’s death left the nine member supreme court evenly split with four liberals and four conservative justices. obama’s nominee could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades, which could affect rulings on contentious issues including abortion, gun rights, the death penalty and political spending. obama said the supreme court was supposed to be above politics and it should remain so. obama said that with politics in the united states so polarized, “this is precisely the time when we should play it straight, and treat the process of appointing a supreme court justice with the seriousness and care it deserves.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky swiftly reiterated that the senate will not consider the nomination by the president. a mcconnell spokesman said the senator had spoken by phone with garland and would not hold a “perfunctory meeting” with him.  john cornyn of texas, the second ranking senate republican, added, “this person will not be confirmed, so there’s no reason going through some motions and pretending like it will happen, because it’s not going to happen.” some cracks began appearing in mcconnell’s strategy of completely shutting out the nominee. a handful of republican senators including susan collins of maine, kelly ayotte of new hampshire, jeff flake of arizona, mark kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio said they would be willing to meet with garland. collins said the senate judiciary committee should hold confirmation hearings. judiciary committee member orrin hatch, whose past support of garland was cited by obama, said the pick does not change his view “at this point” that no obama nominee should be considered.  senator pat toomey of pennsylvania, who is in a tough re election battle, said, “should merrick garland be nominated again by the next president, i would be happy to carefully consider his nomination.” garland is the oldest supreme court nominee since republican richard nixon in 1971 nominated lewis powell, who was 64. presidents tend to pick nominees younger than that so they can serve for decades and extend a president’s legacy. obama may reason that the choice of an older nominee might also entice senate republicans into considering his selection. garland would become the fourth jewish member of the nine member court. there are five roman catholics on the court. obama considered but passed over garland when he made two prior supreme court appointments.  with solid republican support, the senate voted in 1997 to confirm garland to his present job in a bipartisan 76 23 vote after he was nominated by democratic president bill clinton. garland is widely viewed as a moderate. he is a former prosecutor who served in the justice department under clinton. he oversaw the prosecution in the 1995 oklahoma city bombing case including securing the death penalty for the lead defendant, anti government militant timothy mcveigh. in his current post, he is known for narrow, centrist opinions and rhetoric that is measured rather than inflammatory even when in dissent. standing in between obama and vice president joe biden during the rose garden ceremony, an emotional garland referred to the oklahoma city bombing case, saying, “once again, i saw the importance of assuring victims and families that the justice system could work.” obama said he fulfilled his constitutional duty by naming a nominee and said it was time for the senate to do its job.  “presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term. neither should a senator,” obama said. obama, in office since 2009, has already named two justices to the supreme court: sonia sotomayor, who at 55 became the first hispanic justice in 2009, and elena kagan, who was 50 when she became the fourth woman ever to serve on the court in 2010. democrats praised his latest choice. “if merrick garland can’t get bipartisan support no one can,” democratic senator charles schumer of new york said. hillary clinton called garland “a brilliant legal mind,” urging the senate to move ahead with the confirmation process. trump said it was critical for republicans to take back the white house to avoid democrats shaping the supreme court for decades to come.

"the cdc is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to puppies sold through the national pet store chain petland.the outbreak of campylobacter infections has sickened 39 people from seven states, including florida, kansas, missouri, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, and wisconsin.so far nine people have been hospitalized. no deaths have been reported.campylobacter can cause a gastrointestinal illness in humans with symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. the illness typically lasts about a week and symptoms appear within two to five days after exposure. people more likely to get a severe infection include children younger than 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, including those with the genetic blood disorder thalassemia or hiv or people receiving chemotherapy.investigators say evidence indicates that puppies sold through petland stores are a likely source of this current outbreak. the bacteria can spread through contact with dog feces. it usually does not spread from one person to another.twelve of those affected are petland employees from four states. the other 27 people either recently purchased a puppy at petland, visited a petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through petland before illness began.the cdc says the pet store chain is cooperating with health officials to address the outbreak.  cbs 58 ",1
" canada s prime minister justin trudeau on friday urged mexican lawmakers to improve women s rights, delivering a sharp rebuke to a key trading partner that has struggled to curb years of femicide, drug violence and rights abuses.  in a visit to the mexican capital amid tense talks in the united states to save the north american free trade agreement (nafta), trudeau met human rights organizations that briefed him on the violence and challenges faced by many of the country s women. in an address at the mexican senate, trudeau told lawmakers that the stories he had heard from the rights groups about the treatment of women were  unacceptable,  and pressed for gender imbalances to be addressed in an updated nafta.  i challenge you to use your position and power to strongly push for the rights of women and girls in mexico,  trudeau said.  we must move the needle forward on gender inequality.   trudeau s comments serve as a reprimand of mexican president enrique pena nieto s failure to tackle years of drug crime. violence against women in mexico has risen dramatically since the previous administration declared war on organized drug trafficking about a decade ago.  mexico and canada share values, and that certainly includes gender equality and enhancing women s rights,  pena nieto s office said in a statement after a request for comment on trudeau s remarks.  the national citizen observatory of femicide (ocnf), which uses government statistics, reported that 2,735 women were murdered in mexico last year, up sharply from 2,383 the year before. un women, a branch of the united nations, says on its website that mexico has taken steps in recent years to improve gender equality, but has struggled to fully implement and enforce its own regulations.  trudeau and his wife arrived in mexico city on thursday and attended roundtable discussions with non governmental organizations to discuss violence against women, human rights, free speech as well as the risks faced by journalists and activists. although trudeau did not give details on how an updated nafta could protect women s rights, he said that canada supports broader inclusion of women in the world economy.   we know that the success of any society depends on the full participation of women across social, economic and political life,  he added.

" myanmar warned on wednesday that a scolding delivered by the u.n. security council could  seriously harm  its talks with bangladesh over returning home more than 600,000 people who  fled to escape a myanmar military crackdown. in a statement on monday, the security council had urged myanmar to  ensure no further excessive use of military force  and expressed  grave concern over reports of human rights violations and abuses in rakhine state . responding, myanmar s de facto leader aung sang suu kyi, whose less than two year old civilian administration shares power with the military, said the issues facing myanmar and bangladesh could only be resolved bilaterally, a point she says was ignored in the security council statement.  furthermore, the (security council) presidential statement could potentially and seriously harm the bilateral negotiations between the two countries which have been proceeding smoothly and expeditiously,  suu kyi s office said in a statement. in contrast, bangladesh issued a statement saying foreign minister abul hassan mahmood ali  appreciated the recent statement of the u.n. security council  during a meeting with a new resident coordinator of the united nations in bangladesh.  the myanmar statement said ali had been invited to myanmar on nov. 16 and nov. 17, but bangladeshi officials told reuters that the earliest the talks were likely to take place was during the minister s visit for a regional meeting in the myanmar capital of naypyidaw on nov. 20 and nov. 21. the two sides have to agree a process for repatriation of rohingya, with bangladesh reluctant to fall back on the drill used for the return of rohingya refugees to myanmar in the 1990s, as it wants a more lasting solution.   a senior bangladesh foreign ministry official said the united nations should be involved in the process this time.  for years, we tried to resolve this issue bilaterally with myanmar, but it was in vain,  the official told reuters.  this problem is not going to be resolved anytime soon. the un s involvement in the process is a must.  a sour note was struck over the talks last week, as bangladesh officials voiced outrage over suu kyi s spokesman casting suspicion that bangladesh might drag its feet over the repatriation process in order to first secure hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid money. speaking at a conference for commonwealth countries  parliamentarians in dhaka on sunday, bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina called for more international pressure on myanmar.  i would request all of you to discuss rohingya issue with utmost priority and exert pressure on the myanmar government to stop the persecution of its citizens and take them back at the earliest,  she said. u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson is due to visit myanmar on nov. 15, with moves afoot in washington to table a bill calling for sanctions on myanmar that specifically target the military and related business interests. in a nod to china, the myanmar statement said it appreciated the stand taken by some members of the security council who upheld the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. to appease council veto powers russia and china, britain and france dropped a push for the security council to adopt a resolution on the situation and the 15 member body instead unanimously agreed on a formal statement. the united nations has denounced the violence during the past 10 weeks as a classic example of ethnic cleansing to drive the rohingya muslims out of buddhist majority myanmar. rejecting that accusation, the military says its counter insurgency clearance operation was provoked by rohingya militants  synchronized attacks on 30 security posts in the northern part of rakhine state on aug. 25. rohingya refugees say the military torched their villages, but the military say the arsonists were rohingya militants. the refugees  have given harrowing accounts of rape and murder. myanmar says those accusations will have to be investigated. meantime, the exodus from rakhine continues. several thousand rohingya reached bangladesh last week, many wading through shallows on the naf river on the boundary between the two countries, and some making a short, but perilous sea crossing in small boats. on wednesday, 52 rohingya came ashore in bangladesh on a raft lashed together from bamboo and plastic jerrycans, having been unable to find a boat to take them, shariful islam, a bangladesh border guard official, told reuters.  on tuesday, border guards told reuters of at least two other boats with 68 rohingya reaching cox s bazar, where they would join the multitude sheltering in refugee camps. suu kyi, a nobel peace prize winner who defied the junta that ruled myanmar for decades, has been pilloried abroad for not speaking out more forcefully to rein in the military. last week she visited rakhine for the first time since the crisis erupted, meeting community leaders and seeing the efforts to deliver aid and return the region to some semblance of normality. she has spoken of plans for repatriation centers at which refugees will have to prove they once lived in rakhine, before being allowed to return. but having been classed as stateless by former junta rulers, rohingya could struggle to pass the test.

" an overwhelming majority of mexicans hold a negative view of u.s. president elect donald trump, but most believe their own president should meet with him to defend the country’s interests, an opinion poll showed on friday. the survey by polling firm buendia & laredo for newspaper el universal showed that 74 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of trump, a republican. only 5 percent had a positive view of him. trump, who launched a string of verbal attacks on mexico during the campaign, has vowed to build a wall along the u.s. southern border, carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants and has threatened to ditch a trade agreement with mexico and canada. president enrique pena nieto sparked widespread anger by inviting trump to mexico city for talks at the end of august. a parallel survey by the same pollster published at the weekend showed that nearly two thirds of mexicans believed the invitation was a mistake. still, now that trump has been elected president, 53 percent of mexicans said pena nieto should meet the new yorker to promote the country’s interests with the united states, the poll showed. some 43 percent of those surveyed took the opposite view. fully 52 percent of the respondents said they held a positive opinion of trump’s defeated democratic rival, hillary clinton, with only 7 percent of the opposite view. the poll of 1,000 mexicans was conducted between nov. 11 and 15, and had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.

" with a grimace, brigadier general melquiades ordiales of the philippines 1st marine brigade recounted the painful gains made against islamist militants in marawi city.  it took us one week from this point to that point, to cross that street,  he said, casting his eyes to the other side of a two lane road in the heart of the southern philippines city, lined by three storey buildings shattered by air strikes and the remaining walls riddled with bullet holes.  it was really very, very tough.  the grinding urban warfare that has destroyed much of the grandly named sultan omar dianalan boulevard shows just how much of a threat islamic state is to the philippines and potentially other countries in the southeast asian region.  but when the fighting started, philippine authorities were unfazed. after the islamic state backed militants took over large parts of picturesque, lakeside marawi in may, the country s defense minister, delfin lorenzana, predicted the entire conflict would be over in one week. now, after four months of intense aerial bombardment and house by house battles, philippine commanders believe they are in the final stages of the operation to oust the rebels from the city. in the past two weeks, military officials say they have conquered three militant bastions, including a mosque, and restricted about 60 remaining guerrillas to about 10 devastated city blocks in the business district. patrols have been increased on the lake to prevent the supply of armaments and recruits to the holed up militants. high powered weapons military officers who have skirmished for years with islamic insurgents in the southern philippines say the battle in marawi has been more intense and difficult than earlier encounters.  the islamic state militants are better armed, with high powered weapons, night vision goggles, the latest sniper scopes and surveillance drones, said captain arnel carandang,  of the philippines army first scout ranger battalion. he said he has served for almost a decade in the remote jungles and mountains of mindanao, the southern philippines region that has long been wracked by insurgencies. now, carandang says, the military is in unfamiliar urban terrain. the militants have exploited the battlefield to their advantage and held off philippines forces despite a 10 to 1 numerical advantage for the government troops. borrowing heavily from islamic state tactics in the iraqi city of mosul, they have surrounded themselves with hostages and used snipers and a network of tunnels. marawi s underground drainage system and  rat holes    crevices in the walls of high floors allowing access to adjacent buildings   have enabled the rebels to evade bombs and remain undetected, soldiers at the battlefront said.   we believe there have been some foreign terrorists that have been directing their operations that s why they are, how do i define this, really good,  said carandang.  we have seen some cadavers of foreigners. some are white, some are black and some tall people we guess are asians (from outside the philippines). we have been hearing in their transmissions some english speaking terrorists.  hostages   many of them christians   have been deployed to build improvised explosive devices, scavenge for food and weapons in the heat of battle and fight for the islamist rebels, according to those who escaped.  when we were first moved to the mosque, there were more than 200 of us,  an escaped hostage, who asked not to be identified for safety reasons, told reuters last week.  we gradually became fewer. people would go on errands but they wouldn t come back. they either escaped or died. by the time i left, there were only about 100 of us.  the account could not be verified, but military officials confirmed the man escaped from marawi in early august. the hostage said the militants were excited by their successes in marawi, speaking often of the advantages of urban warfare and talking about some of their next possible targets, including other cities in mindanao and the philippines capital manila.  they said they could hide well in the cities. they can get civilians to become hostages and it s more difficult in the mountains with only the soldiers,  he said. many of the fighters are young recruits, who are fanatical and accomplished fighters, the soldiers said.  by the way they move and their tactics, you can see they ve been trained,  said colonel jose maria cuerpo, deputy commander of the 103rd brigade fighting in marawi. for a description of how mindanao youngsters are recruited by militants, click on [nl3n1kb1z5] much of this bloodshed could have been avoided, local political leaders told reuters. naguib sinarimbo, a muslim leader who has negotiated between the military and islamic separatists for years, said he and other elders had urged the armed forces to allow militias and rival islamist groups to take the lead in ousting the islamic state militants. the groups were familiar with marawi s terrain and, through family and clan links, could influence many of the fighters to lay down their weapons, they told the armed forces.  the proposal was rebuffed, sinarimbo said. air power, the military assured them, was the path to a quick win. zia alonto adiong, a provincial politician, said the military also had doubts about the loyalty of some of the  political personalities  offering to provide their militias to push out the fighters. the result was a city in ruins, hundreds of thousands of residents displaced and  emboldened  islamists, sinarimbo said.  they proceeded with the aerial bombing but they didn t take the city,  sinarimbo said.  the military lost authority.  in addition, the devastation of the city will play into  militants  hands, creating resentment and further radicalising many youngsters, he said. marawi residents in evacuation centers or staying with relatives elsewhere are becoming increasingly frustrated, said adiong, who is a spokesman for the local government s crisis management authority. some residents were disappointed and angry that requests for a moratorium on bank loan repayments had not been met, he told reuters.  philippines central bank governor nestor espenilla told reuters legislation would be needed for a debt moratorium and was being studied. mindanao has long been marred by the decades of muslim hostility to rule from manila. after years fighting insurgent groups and then long negotiations, the government signed an agreement in 2014 to give muslim majority areas in mindanao autonomy. but the deal has been long delayed.    this part of the philippines is fertile ground to plant violent extremism,  adiong said.  there is a narrative of social injustice that is strong. young people are fed up with the peace process and nothing concrete or sustainable has developed.   [the militants] use this as the basis to entice people, to get support of the local people.  in marawi, some in the armed forces are hopeful that at least some militants will surrender and hand over between 45 to 50 civilian captives. carandang, the scout rangers captain, however said indications were the rebels are preparing for a bloody final stand.  we are monitoring the enemy s transmissions and it s like during these final days they are being more fanatical,  he said.  transmissions indicate they are preparing for suicide bombings.  an unused suicide vest was discovered this month in marawi s grand mosque, a former stronghold of the militants, government sources told reuters. suicide attacks are rare in the philippines despite decades of islamist insurgency.  that s the difference between here and syria and iraq,  said ordiales, the marine general.  it s almost the same war tactics and fighting tactics, the one thing that s not the same is the human bomb or the suicide bombing.   it hasn t happened, not yet.

" the leader of germany s social democrats (spd) pledged to have u.s. nuclear weapons withdrawn from german territory if, against the odds, he defeats angela merkel to become chancellor next month. addressing a campaign rally in trier late on tuesday, spd leader martin schulz also said he, unlike merkel, would resist demands by u.s. president donald trump for nato members to increase their defense spending.  trump wants nuclear armament. we are against this,  schulz said, apparently trying to differentiate his party from merkel s more hawkish christian democratic union (cdu).  as chancellor, i will commit germany to having the nuclear weapons stationed here withdrawn from our country,  he said. about 20 u.s. nuclear warheads are thought to be stationed at a military base in buechel, in western germany, according to unofficial estimates. the u.s. embassy in berlin said it does not comment on nuclear weapons in germany. taking advantage of trump s extreme unpopularity in germany, schulz also said he would use the money merkel had earmarked for increased military spending for other purposes.  what to do with our money is the central question of this election,  he said, referring to a 30 billion euro tax surplus.  trump demands that 2 percent of gdp, 30 billion euros, should go to military spending, and merkel agreed to that without asking german citizens.  germany and other nato members had already pledged to raise their defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product before trump was elected. while most of them have increased spending on their militaries, only a few have reached the 2 percent goal, and germany is not one of them. most recent polls show schulz s party polling at around 24 percent, some 14 percentage points behind merkel. most expect a booming economy and low unemployment will carry her into a fourth term in sept. 24 elections. however, with germans historically wary of using military force since world war two, schulz s message may resonate among the spd s core voters. after 12 years in office, merkel has become increasingly confident on the global stage. she has pushed for germany to become more militarily self reliant, partly in response to trump s hinting that he might abandon nato allies if they do not spend more on defense. earlier this year, merkel said the times when germany could rely on others to defend it were  to some extent in the past  .

" the white house excluded several major u.s. news organizations, including some it has criticized, from an off camera briefing held by the white house press secretary on friday. reporters for cnn, the new york times, politico, the los angeles times and buzzfeed were not allowed into the session in the office of press secretary sean spicer. spicer’s off camera briefing, or “gaggle,” replaced the usual televised daily news briefing in the white house briefing room. he did not say why those particular news organizations were excluded, a decision which drew strong protests. reuters was included in the session, along with about 10 other news organizations, including bloomberg and cbs. president donald trump has regularly attacked the media and at a gathering of conservative activists on friday he criticized  news organizations that he said provide “fake news”, calling them the “enemy” of the american people. spicer said his team decided to have a gaggle in his office on friday instead of a full briefing in the larger white house briefing room and argued that “we don’t need to do everything on camera every day.”  reporters at the associated press and time magazine walked out of the briefing when hearing that others had been barred from the session.  off camera gaggles are not unusual. the white house often invites handpicked outlets in for briefings, typically for specific topics. but briefings and gaggles in the white house are usually open to all outlets and they are free to ask anything. a pool reporter from hearst newspapers was included in the gaggle on friday and gave full details to the entire press corps. media outlets allowed into the gaggle also shared their audio with others. spicer’s decision drew a sharp response from some of the media outlets that were excluded. “nothing like this has ever happened at the white house in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” dean baquet, executive editor of the new york times, said in a statement.  “we strongly protest the exclusion of the new york times and the other news organizations. free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.” the white house correspondents association, or whca, also protested. “the whca board is protesting strongly against how today’s gaggle is being handled by the white house,” said jeff mason, president of the association and a reuters reporter. during the election campaign last year, trump’s team banned a few news organizations, including the washington post and buzzfeed, from covering his campaign rallies for a period of time to protest their coverage. cnn posted a twitter message on friday afternoon saying: “this is an unacceptable development by the trump white house. apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like. we’ll keep reporting regardless.” ben smith, editor in chief of buzzfeed news, said in a statement: “while we strongly object to the white house’s apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we won’t let these latest antics distract us from continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively.” on friday, spicer said the white house plans to fight against what it says is unfair coverage. “i think we’re going to aggressively push back,” he said.  “we’re just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there.” ",0
" pope francis on thursday urged colombians to shun vengeance after a bloody 50 year civil war but said leaders had to enact laws to end the  darkness  of injustice and social inequality that breeds violence. at the last event of a packed day, the argentine pontiff said mass for a crowd estimated by colombian authorities at just over a million people in bogota s sprawling simon bolivar park. under a light drizzle, he ended the day as he had begun it, urging colombians in his homily to put their differences behind them and beware  the darkness of thirst for vengeance . hours earlier, at the start of his first full day in the country, he had told government leaders in the courtyard of the presidential palace that all colombians should see peace as a long term commitment and not allow it to be weakened by partisan politics. colombians are deeply polarized as they prepare to receive 7,000 former fighters of the farc guerrilla group into society and aim to repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. many colombians are furious that under the 2016 peace deal, farc leaders accused of kidnapping and murder will avoid jail and may receive seats in congress as members of a political party. president juan manuel santos, who attended both events and is the architect of the peace accord, has an approval rating of about 24 percent. in both speeches, francis denounced the social inequality that still plagues colombia, which has extreme poverty in some rural areas. at the morning event, he told leaders that  just laws  were needed to  resolve the structural causes of poverty that lead to exclusion and violence , calling social inequality  the root of social ills.  in the evening the leader of the world s roman catholics  told colombians huddled on wet fields:  here, as in other places, there is a thick darkness which threatens and destroys life   the darkness of injustice and social inequality.  as part of the peace agreement, the government agreed with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) to distribute more land to poor rural communities and to invest and bring development to war torn areas. the farc, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, has also pledged to help subsistence farmers switch from illegal crops like coca, the raw material that makes cocaine, to food.  we want to hear the message of love and peace, so that we open our hearts and leave hatred behind,  said 54 year old william soacha, a clothes salesman, waiting with his family under the rain for the pope s mass to begin. the 80 year old pope, who showed signs of fatigue by thursday night, has received a tumultuous welcome since his arrival on wednesday, with his motorcade having to stop or slow down often because of crowds mobbing the  popemobile . in his speech at the presidential palace, the pope quoted from the 1982 nobel prize acceptance speech of colombian writer gabriel garcia marquez about life and love being the proper response to oppression. in an apparent reference to the late author s best known work,  one hundred years of solitude , he added:   there has been too much hatred and vengeance. the solitude of always being at loggerheads has been familiar for decades, and its smell has lingered for a hundred years; we do not want any type of violence whatsoever to restrict or destroy one more life,  he said. he also prayed in the colonial cathedral before a painting of our lady of chiquinquira, the patron saint of overwhelmingly catholic colombia, before addressing a raucous crowd of young people.  he left a message in the cathedral s visitor book, writing:  i come here as a witness of peace, of the peace that god wants for colombia. this will be possible with the efforts of all.  he will visit the cities of villavicencio, medellin and cartagena before leaving for rome on sunday night.

" most u.s. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. donald trump arrives in scotland on friday to reopen a golf resort. the presumptive republican nominee, 70, visits his family’s ancestral homeland to showcase his far flung business empire. his mother was born on scotland’s isle of lewis. with a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside trump turnberry resort. he has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. et/1100 gmt). his visit to turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in aberdeen on saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of britain’s vote on thursday on whether to remain in the european union. “i don’t think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,” said saul anuzis, former chairman of the michigan republican party. “but since he’s there right in the middle of the eu vote, it may end up being a pr bonanza for him.” the risk is that the real estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. trump has said he would be inclined to leave the eu. he has exchanged insults with british prime minister david cameron, who has called the new yorker’s anti immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. there are no plans for the two to meet. his trip has baffled republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive democratic nominee, former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton, who is 68. trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. “his campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn’t make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,” said david yepsen, director of the paul simon public policy institute at southern illinois university.  turnberry is a storied course where the open championship has been staged four times. trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on scotland’s west coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of glasgow. he has portrayed his determination to build up courses in turnberry and aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that americans would get if he wins the white house on nov. 8. “well, scotland has already been won – and so will the united states,” trump wrote in a column for the press and journal newspaper in aberdeen. an aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the u.s. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. the last republican presidential nominee, former massachusetts governor mitt romney, in 2012 made a gaffe filled campaign trip to london, jerusalem and poland.

" lebanon can no longer handle vast numbers of syrian refugees, its president said on monday, urging world powers to help them return to the calmer parts of their war torn homeland. more than six years into the syrian war, 1.5 million refugees who fled the violence now account for a quarter of lebanon s population.  lebanese president michel aoun told international envoys he wanted to find ways for them to return safely but would not force people back to places where they could face persecution.  my country cannot handle it anymore,  aoun told  representatives of the european union, the arab league and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council at a meeting in beirut, his media office said. the long term presence of refugees is a particularly sensitive issue in lebanon where some politicians say the influx of mainly sunni syrians might destabilize the delicate sectarian balance with christians, shi ite muslims and others.  as the syrian government regains more territory from rebels and militants, calls have increased in lebanon for syrians to return. a series of ceasefire deals has reduced fighting to some extent in parts of western syria.  but rights groups have warned against forcing people back to a country still at war, and refugees have often said they fear facing arrest or conscription into the army.  the u.n. refugee agency does not yet consider syria safe for refugee to return  to. lebanese prime minister saad al hariri has said there can be no forced returns.  aoun told the envoys there were parts of syria not currently at war and territory where calm has returned, a spokesman said.   the return of displaced to stable and low tension areas must be carried out without attaching it to reaching a political solution,  the president s twitter account said.  aoun said it was in the everyone s interest to solve the refugee crisis so that political, economic and social problems in lebanon do not get out of hand.  officials at the meeting thanked lebanon for its generosity in hosting refugees.  they expressed their full understanding of the concerns that are being voiced,  a statement from the envoys said.   a return of refugees to their country of origin must take place in safety, dignity and voluntarily, in accordance with principles of international law,  it said.

" eu chief executive jean claude juncker blasted britain s failure to answer  huge numbers of questions  on its brexit plans as negotiators held a new round of talks on tuesday on a divorce due in less than two years. hours after his chief negotiator michel barnier urged his british counterpart to  start negotiating seriously  when they met in brussels on monday, european commission president juncker echoed the bloc s refusal to discuss the future free trade deal london wants before penciling in terms for leaving the eu. juncker scoffed at a raft of british negotiating papers published over the summer which prime minister theresa may s government said had shown london was responding seriously to the detailed proposals agreed by the other 27 eu states.  i would like to be clear that i did read with the requisite attention all the papers produced by her majesty s government; i find none of them truly satisfactory,  he told european union envoys gathered in brussels for an annual conference.  so there are huge numbers of questions that need to be settled.  these included issues of rights for eu citizens in britain and britons in europe after brexit and the eu uk border that will stretch across the island of ireland, he said.   we need to be crystal clear that we will begin no negotiations on the new economic and trade relationship between the uk and the eu before all these questions are resolved ... that is the divorce between the eu and the uk,  juncker said.  we cannot mix these issues up,  he continued. barnier, he said, had firm instructions from the other 27 governments on the phasing of talks, even if he accepted that some issues could not be fully settled without knowing how trade will work.  first of all we settle the past before we look forward to the future,  he insisted. the head of the european parliament, antonio tajani, joined juncker in piling pressure on london:  the british government must come forward with clear positions in order for talks to advance,  he said in a statement on tuesday evening. negotiators who began two full days of talks on tuesday morning are also trying to settle how much britain may owe the union on departure   a particularly explosive issue as both sides hope to reach some kind of outline divorce terms this year so as to give time to work out a transition to free trade. british negotiators, of whom over 100 were taking part in up to five separate forums at the eu headquarters, presented their legal assessment of an eu demand that juncker has said might leave london paying brussels some 60 billion euros ($72 billion)   a sum may s ministers have dismissed as unacceptable. despite the eu rhetoric, which some in britain see as ill judged, government officials played down any tensions and described monday s hour long meeting between barnier and brexit secretary david davis as cordial and constructive.  may s spokeswoman said britain feels it is in a good position in the negotiations and wants to agree with the european union to move on to discussions about its future relationship by october, when eu leaders next hold a summit.  we believe we re in a good position and we would like to move on to discuss our future relationship,  may s spokeswoman told reporters.   we believe that we need the eu to show some more imagination and flexibility when it comes to these discussions,  she said.  we are seeking to agree by october council that we can move to talk about our future relationship.  davis is due back in brussels late on wednesday and to hold a final news conference with barnier on thursday to sum up the results of what is the third formal round of talks.

" former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara took several shots at the administration of president donald trump on thursday, calling for “facts not falsehoods” as the basis for political discourse and a more welcoming stance towards immigrants in his first public speaking event since being fired one month ago. bharara sprinkled the hour long speech with humor, including a joke about the size of the crowd clearly aimed at trump. but bharara also made a series of thinly veiled criticisms of the new administration, referring multiple times to trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” in washington. “you don’t drain a swamp with a slogan. you don’t drain it by replacing one set of partisans with another. you don’t replace muck with muck,” bharara, 48, said at the cooper union in new york.  “to drain a swamp you need an army corps of engineers, experts schooled in service and serious purpose. not do nothing, say anything, neophyte opportunists who know a lot about how to bully and bluster but not so much about truth, justice and fairness.”  bharara was fired by trump on march 11 after refusing to step down. while he was among 46 u.s. attorneys told to submit their resignations, his dismissal was a surprise because trump had asked him in november to stay in the job. bharara has said it was not made clear to him at first whether or not he was being dismissed. he joked about that initial confusion with a reference to trump’s tv reality show in which he regularly fired people on the spot. “i don’t really understand why this was such a big deal, especially to this white house. i had thought that was what donald trump was good at,” bharara said.  as the chief federal prosecutor for the southern district of new york, bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white collar criminal cases, as well as cases involving national security. he said he was equally proud of the less high profile work his office did to combat gangs and consumer fraud. bharara said he expected his successor to carry on with the office’s reputation for independence. he did not comment on who his possible successor. as for his own future, bharara ruled out running for public office. “i don’t have any plans to enter politics just like i have no plans to join the circus. and i mean no offence to the circus.”  ",0

" south korea approved a plan on thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to north korea, as china warned the crisis on the korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between pyongyang and washington continued. north korea s foreign minister likened u.s. president donald trump to a  barking dog  on thursday, after trump warned he would  totally destroy  the north if it threatened the united states and its allies. chinese foreign minister wang yi said the situation on the korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and could not be allowed to spin out of control.  we call on all parties to be calmer than calm and not let the situation escalate out of control,  wang said, according to a report from the state run china news service on thursday. meeting separately with his south korean counterpart, kang kyung wha, wang reiterated a call for south korea to remove the u.s. built thaad anti missile system, which china says is a threat to its own security.  china hopes south korea will make efforts to reduce tension,  a report on china s official xinhua news agency quoted wang as saying.  the decision to send aid to north korea was not popular in south korea, hitting president moon jae in s approval rating. it also raised concerns in japan and the united states, and followed new u.n. sanctions against north korea over its sixth nuclear test earlier this month. the south s unification ministry said its aid policy remained unaffected by geopolitical tensions with the north. the exact timing of when the aid would be sent, as well as its size, would be confirmed later, the ministry said in a statement. the south said it aimed to send $4.5 million worth of nutritional products for children and pregnant women through the world food programme and $3.5 million worth of vaccines and medicinal treatments through unicef.   we have consistently said we would pursue humanitarian aid for north korea in consideration of the poor conditions children and pregnant women are in there, apart from political issues,  said unification minister cho myong gyon. unicef s regional director for east asia and the pacific karin hulshof said in a statement before the decision the problems north korean children face  are all too real .  today, we estimate that around 200,000 children are affected by acute malnutrition, heightening their risk of death and increasing rates of stunting,  hulshof said.  food and essential medicines and equipment to treat young children are in short supply,  she said. the last time the south had sent aid to the north was in december 2015 through the united nations population fund (unfpa) under ex president park geun hye. south korea s efforts aimed at fresh aid for north korea dragged down moon s approval rating. realmeter, a south korean polling organization, said on thursday moon s approval rating stood at 65.7 percent, weakening for a fourth straight month.  although the approval rate is still high, those surveyed said moon had fallen out of favor due to north korea s continued provocations and the government s decision to consider sending aid to north korea, realmeter said. moon will meet japan s prime minister shinzo abe and trump later on thursday on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly, where north korea was expected to be the core agenda item. in an address on tuesday, trump escalated his standoff with north korea over its nuclear challenge, threatening to  totally destroy  the country of 26 million people if the north threatened the united states and its allies. trump also mocked its leader, kim jong un, calling him a  rocket man . north korea s foreign minister ri yong ho called trump s comments  the sound of a dog barking .  there is a saying that goes:  even when dogs bark, the parade goes on ,  ri said in televised remarks to reporters in front of a hotel near the u.n. headquarters in new york.  if (trump) was thinking about surprising us with dog barking sounds then he is clearly dreaming,  he said. asked by reporters what he thought of trump calling north korean leader kim jong un  rocket man , ri quipped:  i feel sorry for his aides.  north korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3 and has launched numerous missiles this year, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and two other rockets that flew over japan. such provocations have sparked strong disapproval from the international community, especially from the united states and japan.

" republican john neely kennedy, a candidate for the u.s. senate,  won a runoff election in louisiana on saturday against democrat foster campbell in a race that gives the republicans a 52 seat majority in the chamber. campbell told his supporters in the state capital of baton rouge that he had called kennedy to congratulate him on his victory. kennedy, the state treasurer and the favorite going into the runoff, had slightly less than 61 percent of the vote with all 3,904 precincts reporting, according to the state secretary of state’s office. turnout was relatively low. kennedy, who said he will not move to washington d.c. after a campaign spent railing against “insiders,” told supporters “i’d rather drink weed killer than be anywhere else tonight,” a reference to a widely reported campaign quote in which he said he “would rather drink weed killer than support obamacare.” kennedy will fill the seat held by outgoing republican senator david vitter, who is retiring. in conceding, campbell vowed “i’ll never stop fighting for working families, i’ll never stop working for what’s right.” louisiana governor john bel edwards, a democrat, congratulated kennedy on his victory.  “i look forward to working with him to secure additional funding for flood relief, to make long term investments in our infrastructure and to bring louisiana’s federal tax dollars home to help our people,” edwards said in a statement.  with kennedy’s victory, the republicans will have a 52 seat majority in the 100 seat u.s. senate. going into the general election on nov. 8, republicans had a 54 seat majority. kennedy had campaigned on the popularity in his state of president elect donald trump, who easily won louisiana. trump flew to baton rouge for an election eve rally on kennedy’s behalf, and vice president elect mike pence earlier  stumped for kennedy as well. kennedy, 65, was a democrat until he switched party affiliation in the conservative leaning state in 2007.  he had consistently polled well ahead of campbell since placing first in the state’s 24 candidate free for all primary, which included former ku klux klan leader david duke. celebrities including patton oswalt and john leguizamo both actively supported campbell’s losing bid. under louisiana law, all candidates are pitted against each other in the november general election. if no candidate claims a majority, the top two candidates move to a runoff. also on saturday, republicans mike johnson, a state representative, and clay higgins prevailed in congressional runoffs, replacing representatives who made unsuccessful bids for the senate seat won by kennedy.

" chile expects to close an energy swap deal with argentina in the days ahead, chilean energy minister andres rebolledo said in an interview on thursday, the latest example of increasing economic integration between the south american nations. the neighboring countries are also negotiating the locations for five additional transmission line interconnection points, with an agreement expected as early as january, the minister told reuters.  we made a proposal to argentina and we are very close to reaching an agreement,  rebolledo said, referring to the energy swap.   i think we can have an agreement in the next couple of days or if not, over the next few weeks,  he added. chile and argentina share a 3,300 mile (5,300 kilometer) border running north to south along the rugged terrain of the andes mountains. the deal would allow both countries to send natural gas or electricity at one point of the frontier and obtain needed supplies at another border point. in 2016, chile exported 100 gigawatt hours of electricity to argentina and 361 million cubic meters of gas, worth nearly $100 million. the deal is the latest episode in a larger economic and diplomatic rapprochement between the neighboring south american countries that have often had frosty relations. since conservative argentine president mauricio macri came to power in 2015, the two nations have signed free trade deals and begun transporting gas between the nations, among several other measures. rebolledo, who spoke with reuters on the sidelines of the energy and climate partnership of the americas (ecpa) meeting in the coastal city of vina del mar, said chile and argentina are planning to add five new electricity interconnection points in the coming years. for this, he said the countries commissioned studies with financial support from the development bank of latin america (caf) to define the geographic points that would make the project most efficient.  in january we will probably have the result (of the study), with the map of the five main points where there is supply and demand on the other side, and where it is best to put the transmission lines,  he said. chile is currently undergoing a broader transmission buildout. in august, rebolledo told reuters that the government hopes to have a formal proposal to pitch to investors for a line connecting northern chile with southern peru by the end of the current government in march.

" prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into u.s. stock markets are fading fast as republican donald trump’s victory odds lengthen. a reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark s&p 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the nov. 8 election. moreover, based on options term structures   calculated from prices of options with different expirations   it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome, even with election day barely two weeks away, michael purves, head of derivatives research at weeden & co, said. “there had been a modest premium bump for november options a few weeks ago, but that seems to have faded steadily with trump’s slide in polls,” purves said. in a reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month, a victory by democrat hillary clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term.  trump’s chances of defeating clinton to capture the white house have diminished markedly over the last several weeks, according to most polls and prediction markets. the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project, which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 electoral college votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today. the most likely outcome would be 326 votes for clinton to 212 for trump. on predictit, a popular online predictions and betting market, clinton’s implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago. the lack of positioning for an election related volatility shock is consistent across the options market. “i just don’t see a whole lot of shifting of positions. i don’t see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that. it’s a little bit surprising,” said randy frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at charles schwab, austin, texas. “if it was a much closer race it might have been a different story, but the polls have hillary clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea,” frederick said. a brookings institution study published on friday from two u.s. economics professors concluded that a clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility, whereas a trump victory would send it soaring. justin wolfers, of the university of michigan, and eric zitzewitz, of dartmouth college, said recent market reactions to pre election events, including the first trump clinton debate and the release of a video of trump making vulgar comments about women, signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a clinton win. (tinyurl.com/zl4ew4u) while the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the s&p 500 index, individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election related volatility, derivatives analysts at deutsche bank said in a recent note. and just because investors are not braced for election linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm, analysts said. given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for november, the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result. “if you think trump will win, you want to get long spx puts or long cboe volatility index calls right now as protection,” said purves, referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility. a clean sweep by the democrats of the house of representatives, the senate and the white house could also unleash volatility, purves said. indeed, there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election. for s&p 500 index weekly contracts expiring on nov. 11, puts outnumber calls by a 2.1 to 1 margin, compared with 1.9 to 1 for all expirations, according to thomson reuters data. prices for at the money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1.8 percent move, up or down, in the s&p 500 by then, while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2.1 percent. nonetheless, demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap, and getting cheaper.  for instance, the cost for an s&p index option conveying the right to sell an s&p index future at the 2,050 level, about 4 percent below friday’s close, and expiring on nov. 9, the day after the election, has plunged from $12.42 on monday to $4.80 on friday, a 61 percent decline. with trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether republicans can keep their narrow majority in the senate or even their larger advantage in the house of representatives. “gridlock is the most market friendly outcome, and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating,” purves said.

" special counsel robert mueller pushed back on sunday against paul manafort’s efforts to avoid house arrest, arguing that president donald trump’s former campaign manager needed to further detail the finances behind his proposed $12 million bail agreement. in a court memorandum, mueller and his attorneys argued that the court should only agree to a bail agreement if manafort fully explains his finances to the court. prosecutors said his team had not been able to substantiate the value of one of the three properties, as well as several life insurance policies, manafort wants to pledge for bail. manafort, who ran trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate richard gates pleaded not guilty last week to a 12 count indictment by a federal grand jury. they face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine’s former pro russian government. the two are currently under house arrest, and prosecutors have argued they could pose a flight risk. the charges are part of mueller’s investigation into alleged russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in trump’s favor and potential collusion by trump associates, allegations that moscow and the republican president deny. in a saturday court filing, manafort offered to limit his travel and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on fifth avenue in new york that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in trump tower. but prosecutors said they needed an independent appraisal of that fifth avenue property, since manafort was claiming a fair market value of the unit that appeared to exceed other outside estimates. prosecutors also argued they needed time to talk to manafort’s insurance company about his policies. the prosecutors noted that manafort would be required to forfeit one of those policies, worth $2.6 million, should he be convicted, creating additional questions about its value in a potential bail agreement. in the document, mueller said his team was in talks with manafort’s counsel about striking a bail agreement but that manafort had not provided enough detail yet on his finances. “those discussions are best described as ongoing, and the government is not prepared to consent to a change in the current conditions of release at least until manafort provides a full accounting of his net worth and the value of the assets that he proposes to pledge,” mueller said in the court memorandum. u.s. district judge amy berman jackson said on thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for monday to consider changes.

" two of britain s most senior officers said the pressure on the police forces was not sustainable after last week s attack on a packed london train became the fifth major attack this year. fewer officers could make it harder to prevent future attacks and it will force difficult choices about where to put police resources, they said. a homemade bomb engulfed a train carriage in flames at parsons green underground station in west london last friday injuring 30. cressida dick, london s police commissioner, said it could have been much worse. britain had previously faced four deadly incidents since march which killed a total of 36 people.  in the long run, if we continue with this level of threat, which is what people are predicting ... this is not sustainable for my police service,  dick said in an interview on lbc radio. six men have been arrested and four remain in custody since the parsons green attack.  that was a very very dangerous bomb. it partially detonated, it had a large quantity of explosive and it was packed with shrapnel. so it could have been so much worse,  dick said.  while the bombing at parsons green was not deadly, the aftermath of the attack still saw extra police on the streets and the threat level raised a notch to critical. interior minister amber rudd has announced an extra 24 million pounds ($32.55 million) of funding for counter terrorism policing following the bombing, in addition to 707 million previously announced support for 2017/2018.  but while the government has committed to increase the overall spend on counter terrorism by 3 billion pounds, sara thornton, head of national police chiefs  council (npcc), said that not enough of the budget would support frontline officers. there are about 20,000 fewer officers than there were when prime minister theresa may s conservatives came to power in 2010 and thornton said numbers were at levels last seen in 1985 despite a 10 percent rise in crime last year.      every time there s a terror attack, we mobilize specialist officers and staff to respond but the majority of the officers and staff responding come from mainstream policing,  she wrote  in a blog post on the npcc website.   this puts extra strain on an already stretched service.

" two influential u.s. congressmen have asked the world health organization’s cancer agency to get ready to testify about its work assessing if substances cause cancer, citing concerns about its “scientific integrity”. their letter to the international agency for research on cancer (iarc), seen by reuters and sent on wednesday, is part of ongoing investigations by two congressional committees into iarc that were fueled by the agency’s review of glyphosate, the primary ingredient of monsanto co’s weedkiller roundup. a letter to iarc director chris wild from the republican chairmen of the house committee on science and the subcommittee on environment said they are “concerned about the scientific integrity” of iarc’s “monograph” program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. iarc, a semi autonomous part of the who based in lyon, france, has in recent years assessed whether substances as diverse as coffee, mobile phones and processed meat cause cancer   reports that have all caused controversy. a spokeswoman for iarc said she could not immediately comment on whether the letter had been received. iarc says its methods are scientifically sound and its monographs are “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest”.    in a second letter seen by reuters, the congressmen, lamar smith and andy biggs, expressed concern that iarc’s assessment meetings, deliberations and drafts are not made public.  “it is an affront to scientific integrity to keep ‘confidential’ a scientific process that directly influences policy and individual taxpayers,” smith and biggs wrote.   “with united states’ taxpayer dollars funding (part of the monograph program), it is this (science) committee’s duty to ensure sound science and transparency within the agency.” citing data from the u.s. national institutes of health (nih), the letter to wild said that since 1985, iarc has received more than $48 million from nih, more than $22 million of which went to the monographs program. it added that smith’s committee on science, space and technology may soon hold a hearing to receive testimony from iarc on how it conducts its reviews. it asked wild to provide “names and contact information of iarc affiliated individuals who would serve as potential witnesses for this hearing”. the second letter, sent on wednesday to acting u.s. health secretary eric hargan, asked his department to provide “all documents and communications between or among members of the iarc monograph program and any research institutes or agencies within hhs.” in this letter, the lawmakers said their aim was to understand the extent to which the taxpayer funded national institute of environmental health sciences and the national institutes of health are involved with iarc’s monograph process. this is “to ensure scientific integrity and an honest use of taxpayer dollars”, the letter said.  in an assessment in 2015 that put it at odds with many government regulators, including those in the united states, europe and japan, iarc classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic”.          a reuters investigation in october found that a draft of a key section of iarc’s assessment of glyphosate underwent significant changes before the report was made public. reuters also reported in june on how the chairman of the iarc glyphosate panel was aware of new data showing no link between the weed killer and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published. the congressional committee letters cited these reuters investigations as well as other media reports, saying they revealed “troubling evidence” about the way iarc operates. in the letters, smith and biggs asked iarc to respond by nov. 8, and the department of health and human services to respond by nov. 15.

" a u.s. congressional panel has warned of an “alarming” rise in china’s interference in hong kong, noting fears over the former british colony’s continued role as a global financial hub. in its annual report to congress on wednesday, the bipartisan u.s. china economic and security review commission highlights the “chilling” abduction and detention of five booksellers based in hong kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms. britain handed hong kong back to china in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide ranging autonomy remain intact. the commission, in a detailed 33 page section, urges a fresh probe from the state department into hong kong’s autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight. “hong kong’s traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the united states, as u.s. trade and investment ties with hong kong are substantial,” the report notes. it says the booksellers’ detentions   including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside hong kong   broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in september’s legislative election. “this incident has threatened the maintenance of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and led some observers to question hong kong’s status as a leading global financial hub,” the report warns. “the election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in hong kong.” u.s. senators marco rubio and tom cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze u.s. based assets and ban u.s. entry of those responsible for the “surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in hong kong”, according to a statement on rubio’s senate website. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said hong kong was an internal matter for china and no foreign country had the right to interfere. “in order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support,” geng told a daily news briefing. “those who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed.” the report comes amid deepening concerns in beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. the high court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted china when taking their oath of office, from the legislature. in a statement after the report’s release, the hong kong government said the “one country, two systems” principle was being implemented successfully, as was the city’s role as a global commercial hub. it also urged foreign parties not to interfere. the booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland china but freely available in hong kong. their plight fueled western governments’ concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests. one of the five men, swedish passport holder gui minhai, who disappeared from the thai resort of pattaya last october, is the only one still in detention in china. another, lam wing kee, returned to hong kong in june, saying he had been held captive by chinese agents for eight months.  the report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of china’s broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the south china sea and taiwan.

" an oklahoma bill that allows judges to take into consideration a diagnosis of ptsd for veterans unanimously passed the state senate on tuesday, adding to a series of u.s. laws seeking to address mental illness among military veterans. oklahoma house bill 2595 allows judges to take into account a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) as a mitigating factor when sentencing veterans who have been diagnosed with the illness. the bill, which now goes to the governor for a decision on approval, follows similar measures in states including alaska and california.  “this is neither a democratic or republican issue, but just something we should have for veterans,” said state representative richard morrissette, a sponsor of the legislation and a democrat in the republican dominated oklahoma legislature. “we train men and women to defend our nation in combat and then we expect, upon their return to civilian life, the trauma experienced by these individuals to be erased from their psyche. that is an unreasonable and unfair expectation,” he said. state data shows that compared to other states, oklahoma has a higher percentage of veterans who have been deployed in danger areas overseas. more than 63 percent of the oklahoma national guard was deployed as of 2014 to iraq or afghanistan, and more than a third were deployed multiple times, the data showed. according to the national institutes of health, the united states had 161 bills that dealt with ptsd in 2014 and 43 traumatic stress, non ptsd bills.  in 2014, california allowed courts to consider ptsd, sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury or mental health problems as a mitigating factor in granting probation and treatment instead of jail time, it said. in 2014, alaska passed the first law allowing judges to consider ptsd as a mitigating factor during the sentencing of veterans, it said.

" the u.s. senate armed services committee voted overwhelmingly on wednesday to recommend president elect donald trump’s pick for secretary of defense, retired marine general james mattis. the committee voted 26 1 to back mattis’ nomination when it is received by the full senate from trump after he is sworn in as president. as a result, mattis’ nomination will be sent directly to the senate for a vote without referral to the committee. the identity of the senator who voted against mattis was not immediately available. congress cleared the way for mattis’ quick confirmation last week by backing a waiver that would allow him to lead the pentagon despite retiring from active duty as a marine general only in 2013. the 66 year old mattis, who is highly respected by many fellow marines, retired 3 1/2 years ago after more than four decades of military service. the 1947 national security act requires a seven year gap between active duty military service and the cabinet position. trump’s fellow republicans in congress and democrats have both heaped praise on mattis since his nomination was announced.

" on a rooftop overlooking the walls of jerusalem’s old city, around 200 american israeli fans of donald trump gathered to proclaim their support for the republican candidate, convinced he will be israel’s best friend if elected. wearing “make america great again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in trump t shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti semitism of some of his supporters. “trump will let israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what i like,” david weissman, a 35 year old from queens, new york, who moved to israel three years ago, said at the event late on wednesday. “he’s not a saint, but look at his achievements. he’s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical islam, and he’s not going to support the two state solution,” he said, referring to long standing efforts to forge peace with the palestinians. trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. others at the rally said they liked the fact that trump was promising to move the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, officially recognizing jerusalem as israel’s capital, and would not berate israel for building jewish settlements in occupied territory. “it’s very important that he becomes president,” said connie gordner, 82, who moved to israel from jacksonville, florida, 21 years ago. “if hillary clinton becomes president, we’re dead.” the rally was organized by republicans overseas israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 u.s. citizens living in israel or in jewish settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem, which the palestinians seek for their own state. even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come nov. 8. marc zell, co chairman of the non profit group, believes around three quarters of american israelis support the republican party and its candidate. in an impassioned speech to the small crowd, david friedman, trump’s adviser on israel, heaped criticism on democratic candidate hillary clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said trump was israel’s greatest hope. “under trump, the united states will never pressure israel into accepting a two state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the israeli people,” he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of “crooked hillary”. while the motley crowd was unabashed in its trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most jewish israelis favor clinton over trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. the critical element is american israelis who retain the right to vote in u.s. elections. some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national religious outlook. trump’s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. on wednesday, he delivered a minute long video to the rally, playing up his connections to judaism through his daughter’s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. “my administration will stand side by side with the jewish people and israel’s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only jewish americans and israelis but also all americans and israelis,” he said. “together we will make america and israel safe again.” ",0
" susan collins, one of the few remaining moderate republicans in the u.s. senate, is expected to announce on friday whether she will run for governor of maine next year in what would be a bid to replace conservative governor paul lepage. a collins spokeswoman confirmed she plans to declare her intentions for the gubernatorial race following months of speculation on whether the four term senator would be willing to leave the senate, where she has played a pivotal role. last month, collins was one of only three republican senators to publicly announce her opposition to a bill repealing the “obamacare” healthcare law and replacing it with more a limited plan. lepage, also a republican, is barred by state law from seeking another term. if collins decides to run, she could keep her senate seat while campaigning. her term as senator expires at the end of 2020. the 64 year old collins easily won re election to her senate seat in 2014, with nearly 70 percent of the vote. as one of the few centrists in the bitterly divided senate, collins has often cast herself as a bridge between republicans and democrats in seeking bipartisan compromises. maine’s attorney general, janet mills, has said she is seeking the democratic nomination for governor.

" u.s. senators questioned state department officials closely on thursday about corruption in afghanistan and said failure to address it could cause them to rethink the billions of dollars the united states spends there each year. “i don’t know what the political will here in the united states will be to continue to support the afghans in light of what is going on there,” said democratic senator robert menendez, a senior member of the senate foreign relations committee. menendez described himself as someone who has been supportive of u.s. afghanistan policy, but said he would “have a totally different view” if the government in kabul does not act. on wednesday, the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction (sigar) issued a report that strongly criticized washington for pouring billions of dollars into afghanistan with so little oversight that it fueled corruption and undermined the u.s. mission. the united states spends $5 billion per year in afghanistan, about $4 billion for defense and national security and another $1 billion in civilian assistance, plus billions more for the cost of the thousands of troops and military contractors there. richard olson, the state department’s special representative for afghanistan and pakistan, agreed that corruption can undermine governance. but he called afghan president ashraf ghani “a committed partner” in fighting corruption. ghani, olson said, has taken steps including addressing the kabul bank scandal, canceling a fuel contract and setting up a monitoring and evaluation committee with experts on anti corruption. “it is a dramatically different situation from what it was prior to 2014,” olson testified.

" repealing obamacare could take months and developing replacement health insurance plans could take years, senior republican aides in the u.s. congress said on thursday, discouraging talk of a quick end to the program after president elect donald trump takes office on jan. 20. trump has promised to repeal obamacare, and republican lawmakers have said repealing president barack obama’s signature domestic initiative will be the first thing they take up in the new year, saying it should be rushed to trump’s desk for signing into law. but the project is going to take time, said senior republican aides in the house of representatives, asking not to be named. “we are talking a matter of weeks, in two months   but not a matter of many months” for congress to pass a repeal, one aide said, adding that republicans “certainly” hope trump will sign the repeal into law in the first half of 2017. congressional republicans are consulting with the trump transition team on when the effective date of the repeal should be, another aide said. setting it a few years out will provide lawmakers time to debate whether and how to replace some elements of the obamacare law.  the effective date of repeal “can be as short as two (years), it can be as long as three or four. we have to see where the trump administration wants to go in terms of how much time they need on this,” the second house aide said. some 20 million previously uninsured americans gained health coverage through the affordable care act, as obamacare is officially called. coverage was extended by expanding medicaid and through online exchanges where consumers can receive income based subsidies. republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, criticizing it as government overreach. they say they want to replace it by giving states, not the federal government, more control. talk that the republican majority congress could repeal the program in january was not based on careful consideration of the process or politics, said joe antos, a health policy expert at the conservative american enterprise institute. “i can see repeal relatively quickly,” antos said, although not within a few weeks, “but replace is harder.” “democrats will put up every procedural hurdle they can (to repeal),” said tevi troy, head of the american health policy institute. stuart butler, a senior fellow at the brookings institution, noted that a four year effective date of repeal could fall after the next presidential election. “somehow i doubt people will see that as a fulfilled campaign promise,” he said.

" a group of 38 u.s. senators asked the u.s. environmental protection agency on thursday to abandon plans to lower biofuel requirements for oil refiners in 2018, according to a letter made public by the office of democratic senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. the senators, including republican senator chuck grassley of iowa, said in the letter that the epa should restructure its proposal for the 2018 version of a rule that each year requires  producers of oil based fuels to include renewable fuels such as ethanol in their products. they said the agency should increase the amount of biofuels that must be included in the products. “the rule unjustifiably flatlines biomass based diesel, reduces advanced biofuels and reduces the cellulosic biofuel blending target by about 25 percent,” the letter said. “the final rule should address these shortfalls.” epa spokesman jahan wilcox said in an email to reuters: “we will respond to senator grassley and his colleagues through the proper channel.” ",0
" an italian judge ruled on tuesday that a convicted mobster and son of late boss salvatore  toto  riina be detained for a year in a secure labor unit, a judicial source said, less than two weeks after his father died, leaving the sicilian mafia s future uncertain. convicted of mafia membership in 2004 and sentenced to nearly nine years in prison before being released on parole, giuseppe salvatore riina, 40, has been under police surveillance in the northern town of padua. criminals who are deemed dangerous to society or likely to re offend can be sent to a secure unit, known as a  workhouse  in italy, with the aim of rehabilitating them into society through manual labor. in riina s case, investigators in rome found that he had contact with drug dealers, prompting a prosecutor in padua to ask for him to be held under tighter security, the source said.  riina declined to comment through his lawyer.  a decision has not yet been taken on which of italy s five workhouses riina will be sent to, the source said. the judge handed down a one year term, rather than the three years the padua prosecutor had requested. on state television last year, riina said he had been happy during his childhood, when his fugitive father lived under an assumed name. toto riina died on nov. 17 in a hospital in parma, the italian city where he had been serving 26 life sentences for murders committed between 1969 and 1992. nicknamed the  boss of bosses , toto riina changed the structure of the sicilian mafia, concentrating power in his own hands. his savagery prompted hundreds of mobsters to testify against him, allowing magistrates to uncover the secrets of cosa nostra and prosecute its leaders.

" a rapidly weakening typhoon lan made landfall in japan on monday, setting off landslides and flooding that prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, but then headed out to sea after largely sparing the capital, tokyo. four people were reported killed, hundreds of plane flights  canceled, and train services disrupted in the wake of lan, which had maintained intense strength until virtually the time it made landfall west of tokyo in the early hours of monday.  at least four people were killed, including a man who was hit by falling scaffolding, a fisherman tending to his boat, and  a young woman whose car had been washed away by floodwaters. another casualty was left comatose by injuries and a man was missing, nhk public television said. around 130 others suffered minor injuries. rivers burst their banks in several parts of japan and fishing boats were tossed up on land. a container ship was stranded after being swept onto a harbor wall but all 19 crew members escaped injury. some 80,000 people in koriyama, a city 200 km (124 miles) north of tokyo, were ordered to evacuate as a river neared the top of its banks, nhk said, but by afternoon water levels were starting to fall. several hundred houses in western japan were flooded.  my grandchild lives over there. the house is fine, but the area is flooded, and they can t get out,  one man told nhk. lan had weakened to a category 2 storm when it made landfall early on monday, sideswiping tokyo, after powering north for days as an intense category 4 storm, according to the tropical storm risk monitoring site. lan is the marshall islands word for  storm . by monday afternoon the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression and it was in the pacific, east of the northernmost main island of hokkaido, the japan meteorological agency said.  around 350 flights were canceled and train services disrupted over a wide area of japan, although most commuter trains were running smoothly in tokyo.  toyota motor corp canceled the first shift at all of its assembly plants but said it would operate the second shift as normal.

" a former canadian police chief and several colleagues who fought against making marijuana use legal have switched sides and embraced the looming legalization of cannabis with a leap into business. with canada s legalization of a multi billion dollar marijuana industry set for next year, former police officers who once argued for mandatory jail time for minor marijuana offences are among those in line to capitalize on the change. the most high profile is julian fantino, a former toronto police chief and conservative cabinet minister who fought against the legalization of pot and who said he now sees the value of a legal medical pot industry.  for a lot of us, until you get into this thing, all we know is the stigma associated with marijuana. and there is that, of course, but ... it s only a matter of time, before it becomes a recognized, therapeutic, prescribed drug,  fantino said in an interview. canadian prime minister justin trudeau promised to legalize recreational marijuana use in his 2015 election campaign and new legislation will let adults grow, buy or possess small amounts of marijuana as of july 1, 2018. under the new law, private or government retailers will be able to sell marijuana and licensed producers will be able to grow it. the canadian cannabis black market is estimated to be worth between c$7 billion ($5.77 billion) and c$10 billion a year, with rates of youth use among the highest in the world. analysts expect it will take time for legal trade to push aside unsanctioned competition. fantino and his partners   a former royal canadian mounted police officer, a former fire chief and a former member of parliament   are promoting their company aleafia, which provides patients with authorizations for medical marijuana, as well as other medical services. medical marijuana is already legal. fantino said he would  absolutely  be pursuing the business even if canada was not legalizing the lucrative recreational industry. but his change of heart has met with skepticism in some circles. toronto star newspaper columnist royson james wrote  the hypocrisy stinks to high heaven.  on twitter, pot activist jodie emery called the news  infuriating.   the canadian broadcasting corp introduced an interview with fantino by noting he had  once compared weed to murder.  fantino said the quote was taken out of context and he  did what i could to apply the laws of the land with conscience.  other ex cops are getting into the business side of marijuana. former deputy toronto police chief kim derry has been involved in medical marijuana businesses since 2012. derry is president of met scan canada, which he said provides security for about half a dozen marijuana growers. he expects that number to grow once recreational production becomes legal.  from a background of criminal activity, i certainly know how (grow operations) operated in the past,  derry said.  i know all the pieces, through a chain of supply, where there s weaknesses.  the government s effort to legalize marijuana is headed up by another former toronto police chief, bill blair, who succeeded fantino in 2005 before they both turned to politics. blair said retired police officers have been getting calls for advice on medical marijuana production since related laws came into effect in 2013.   i think many are being sought out for their expertise in public service and regulatory law and security around these things,  he said, adding he does not think its unseemly for police officers to make money off cannabis.  for me, it s entirely consistent with my life s work and i wouldn t comment on anyone else s history or motives.  pot possession remains illegal until july and canadians continue to be prosecuted for it   17,733 people in 2016, according to statistics canada. studies have found marginalized communities are disproportionately targeted. the government is developing ways to track each marijuana plant from seed to point of sale and test for quality. it has yet to draft detailed advertising rules or finalize tax levels.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton defended her paid speeches to wall street, saying in an interview that aired on friday that they would not soften her campaign pledges for tougher regulation.  the former u.s. senator from new york and secretary of state is under pressure from rival candidate bernie sanders, who has made her wall street ties a top campaign issue and called for her to release transcripts of her remarks. clinton was reportedly paid millions in appearance fees after leaving the state department. asked whether she could assure u.s. voters that the speeches would not undermine her calls to rein in the financial industry, clinton told msnbc: “absolutely.” “i’m on the public record. i told them what i’m going to do. i said i’m going to go after big banks that pose a systemic risk. i want you to hold me accountable for that because i will do that exactly,” she told the network’s “morning joe” program.  the new york times, in an editorial late on thursday, urged clinton to release the transcripts, saying “voters have every right to know what mrs. clinton told these groups.” according to the paper, clinton earned $11 million in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 from 51 speeches to banks and other groups and industries. clinton has said she will release copies of her remarks when other presidential candidates do the same.  on friday, she said president barack obama’s fundraising from wall street had not prevented him from enacting dodd frank financial services reforms after the 2007 2009 financial crisis.  clinton reiterated her position that regulations must go farther, saying, “dodd frank is great. it gives us a foundation. it doesn’t go far enough. we need to look at these other entities that pose systemic risks, as well.” as far as so called unwinding of banks that pose a risk, she added: “we’re going to do in an orderly way so there will not be any surprises.”  sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont, is vying with clinton for the democratic nomination in the november presidential election. “i do not receive many millions of dollars from wall street or the pharmaceutical industry or other powerful, wealthy interests in this country, and have not given speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars to wall street,” sanders told a chicago rally on thursday, the washington post reported. the next democratic nominating contest is on saturday in south carolina.

" the photo from omar mateen’s high school yearbook is hardly remarkable   a toothy, dimpled smile with a peach fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair.  his transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of america’s worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with muslim extremists. as families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting, a picture began to emerge of the 29 year old killer as a quiet, devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak. early on sunday, he stormed a packed gay nightclub in orlando, florida, with a handgun and ar 15 semi automatic rifle, fatally shooting 50 people before police killed him. fifty three others were wounded, many critically. his ex wife, sitora yusufiy, described him as “bipolar,” and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper. she said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by mateen during outbursts in which he would “express hatred towards everything”. she was “rescued” by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in 2009 and ended in divorce, she said. “he would often get into fights with his parents, but as i was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me,” she told reporters in boulder, colorado outside a home where she was staying.  she said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in fort pierce, florida, and had once sought admission to a police academy. in fort pierce on florida’s southeast coast, 120 miles (195 km) from the shooting, the imam at the mosque that mateen attended for nearly 10 years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation. “he hardly had any friends,” syed shafeeq rahman, who heads the islamic center of fort pierce, told reuters. “he would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave.” rahman said mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals. he usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week, mostly in evenings and as recently as friday, but he didn’t display signs of radicalism, according to fellow worshippers interviewed by reuters. mateen was born in new york of afghan descent but spent most of his life in florida, attending martin county high school in stuart, a small city about a 20 minute drive from the fort pierce condominium where had most recently lived. a classmate described him as a typical teen who played football. a school yearbook image of mateen was seen by reuters.   samuel king, who was one year ahead of mateen, said the two often spoke after mateen graduated in 2004. king waited tables at ruby tuesday’s restaurant at treasure coast square, a mall where mateen worked at gnc, the nutrition store, he said. king, who is openly gay, said the mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti homosexual. “what is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at ruby tuesday’s when i worked there were gay. he clearly was not anti (gay) at least not back then. he did not show any hatred to any of us.” while at gnc, mateen lifted weights and “got really buff,” king said, describing mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school. “something must have changed” since he last saw him, he added. mateen’s father, mir seddique, told nbc news the massacre was not related to religion. he said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in miami a couple of months ago.  the fbi twice interviewed mateen for having suspected ties to islamist militants. the first investigation took place in 2013 when mateen made inflammatory comments to co workers that indicated sympathy for militants, fbi special agent in charge ron hopper told a news conference in orlando. at the time, mateen worked as a security guard at g4s, a british owned multinational company that is among the world’s largest private security firms.  he joined g4s in september 2007, carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer, the company said.  g4s provides security to federal buildings in florida. mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the fbi was “unable to verify the substance of his comments,” hopper said. daniel kime, a security guard employed along with mateen by at g4s in the fort pierce area, said he met mateen briefly three or four times. “every time i saw him he never smiled. if you said good morning, he’d just walk right by you, like he had a chip on his shoulder,” kime told reuters. daniel gilroy, who said he was a co worker of mateen’s at g4s, said that mateen’s anger was “constant.” “any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words,” he told fox news.  in 2014, hopper said, mateen was investigated and interviewed again, this time for suspected connections to moner mohammad abu salha, an american citizen who became a suicide bomber in syria in 2014. hopper said mateen’s contact with abu salha was minimal and it was deemed that “he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time.” hopper said mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of sunday’s attack. he said mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to islamic state, also known as isis, which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of iraq and syria. but the depth of that commitment is unclear. mateen also mentioned the boston marathon bombers during the call, which he made 20 minutes into the shootings, authorities said. mateen’s former wife said she met mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to florida to marry him, according to the washington post. “he was not a stable person,” she said. “he beat me. he would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.” mateen had a florida firearms license that expired in 2013 and a state permit to work as a security guard, according to public records. he was registered as a democrat. city, state and federal officials were searching mateen’s apartment in the woodlands condominium building in fort pierce and had told other residents to evacuate.

" russia and the united states are still discussing the timing of the first face to face encounter between donald trump and vladimir putin, expected to take place at a g20 summit in germany later this week, a kremlin aide said on monday. since trump was elected u.s. president, russian has been keenly anticipating his first meeting with putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in u.s. russia relations that plunged to post cold war lows under trump’s predecessor, barack obama. but with trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates’ links to moscow, the encounter with putin has become a minefield. too warm a meeting would allow trump’s domestic opponents to accuse him of being a kremlin stooge. kremlin foreign policy aide yuri ushakov told reporters the trump putin meeting would happen on the sidelines of the g20 summit, in hamburg, but it was not yet finalised how it would fit into the summit’s schedule. “we will be looking for certain breaks, windows to hold this, the most important, meeting,” ushakov said. “we have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level ... that’s why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.” asked about the agenda for the meeting, ushakov said: “i’ve heard the americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and syria. it seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.” ushakov said that ties between russia and the united states were at “zero level.” the kremlin aide urged the united states “to save us from the need to retaliate” against washington for expelling russian diplomats and seizing two russian diplomatic compounds on u.s. soil, one in maryland and the other on long island. barack obama ordered the expulsion of the 35 russians in late december last year, seized the compounds, and imposed sanctions on two russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election. russian has denied interfering in the u.s. election. putin said at the time he would not retaliate immediately, in the expectation that relations would improve under trump. with no thaw materializing yet, russian officials have said this month that they may now have to take “symmetrical” steps in retaliation.

" u.s. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday that president barack obama has politicized the supreme court nomination process by putting forward veteran appellate court judge merrick garland during a presidential election. “it seems clear that president obama made this nomination not with the intent of seeing the nominee confirmed, but in order to politicize it for purposes of the election,” mcconnell said on the floor of the senate after obama, a democrat, announced his choice at the white house.  “instead of spending more time debating an issue where we can’t agree, let’s keep working to address the issues where we can,” the senator from kentucky said.  “the senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next president nominates, whoever that might be,” mcconnell said. obama’s second four year term ends in january 2017 and the campaign to choose his successor has been hotly contested. businessman and former reality tv personality donald trump is the republican front runner and former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton is leading the democratic party race for the nomination to run in the nov. 8 election.

" u.s. president donald trump raised the firing of his fbi director in a meeting with russia’s foreign minister to explain why he had been unable to find areas of cooperation with moscow, the white house national security adviser said on sunday. “the gist of the conversation was that the president feels as if he is hamstrung in his ability to work with russia to find areas of cooperation because this has been obviously so much in the news,” h.r. mcmaster said in an interview on abc’s “this week with george stephanopoulos.” reports that trump boasted to russian officials of firing former fbi director james comey to relieve “great pressure” from a law enforcement probe into russian meddling in the 2016 election engulfed his administration in turmoil just as trump left for his first foreign trip as president on friday. “i just fired the head of the fbi. he was crazy, a real nut job,” trump said during a may 10 meeting with russian officials, according to a report by the new york times that cited a document summarizing the meeting and an unnamed u.s. official. russian foreign minister sergei lavrov denied that comey had come up during the meeting, according to interfax news agency. mcmaster also said in sunday’s interview that the central purpose of trump’s conversation with lavrov and russia’s ambassador to washington was to confront russia on areas where the united states considers them disruptive, such as syria. mcmaster criticized sources who told reporters that trump had disclosed highly classified information to the russian officials in the meeting about a planned islamic state operation. “in a concern about divulging intelligence they leaked actually not just the information from the meeting, but also indicated the sources and methods to a to a newspaper. i mean it doesn’t make sense,” mcmaster said.”    ",0

" the new york times’s editorial board endorsed democrat hillary clinton and republican john kasich as they seek to become their parties’ nominees in the u.s. presidential election, calling clinton one of the most “deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.” clinton, a front runner facing a strong challenge from senator bernie sanders, and kasich, who has only dimly registered in the polls, received the endorsements from one of the nation’s largest newspapers two days before voters in iowa hold the first nominating contest for the nov. 8 election.    “mr sanders does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that mrs clinton offers,” the board wrote, after praising him for making important points about economic inequality and foreign policy.  the board praised clinton’s term as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, and said she had shown a lifelong commitment to american workers, particularly women. the board criticized her as too quick to propose using military force abroad, but said she still would be a better military leader than her republican rivals. the times editorial board previously endorsed clinton in 2008, when she ran against barack obama. in that endorsement, it also argued that clinton had more experience and had presented more detailed policy ideas than her rival. kasich, the governor of ohio, was the only candidate in the crowded republican field the board said it was able to stomach.  “gov. john kasich of ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race,” the board wrote. it said kasich had “been capable of compromise and believes in the ability of government to improve lives.” the board said that front runner donald trump did not have experience of international issues or interest in learning about them. it said ted cruz would “say anything to win.”  (reporting by mary milliken; editing by kevin liffey) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" the white house press corps gathered on saturday for its annual black tie dinner, a toned down affair this year after donald trump snubbed the event, becoming the first incumbent u.s. president to bow out in 36 years. without trump, who scheduled a rally instead to mark his 100th day in office, the usually celebrity filled soiree hosted by the white house correspondents’ association took a more sober turn, even as it pulled in top journalists and washington insiders. most of trump’s administration also skipped the event in solidarity with the president, who has repeatedly accused the press of mistreatment. the president used his campaign style gathering to again lambaste the media.  “i could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away,” he told a crowd in harrisburg, pennsylvania, calling out the new york times, cnn and msnbc by name. in washington, whca president jeff mason defended press freedom even as he acknowledged this year’s dinner had a different feel, saying attempts to undermine the media was dangerous for democracy. “we are not fake news, we are not failing news organizations and we are not the enemy of the american people,” said mason, a reuters correspondent. instead of the typical roasts   presidents of both parties have delivered their own zingers for years   the event returned to its traditional roots of recognizing reporters’ work and handing out student scholarships as famed journalists bob woodward and carl bernstein presented awards. “that’s not donald trump’s style,” nbc news’ andrea mitchell told msnbc, referring to the self deprecating jokes presidents in the past have made despite tensions with the press. instead, the humor fell to headline comedian hasan minhaj. “welcome to the series finale of the white house correspondents’ dinner,” minhaj, who plays a correspondent on comedy central’s “the daily show” program, told the crowd. he also joked about trump, despite organizers’ wishes, saying he did so to honor u.s. constitutional protection of free speech: “only in america can a first generation, indian american muslim kid get on this stage and make fun of the president.” in a video message, actor alec baldwin, who has raised trump’s ire playing him on nbc’s “saturday night live” program also encouraged attendees. few other celebrities graced the red carpet, although some well known washingtonians, such as former secretary of state madeleine albright and republican representative darrell issa of california, appeared.  trump attended in 2011, when then president barack obama made jokes at the expense of the new york real estate developer and reality television show host. in an interview with reuters this week, trump said he decided against attending as president because he felt he had been treated unfairly by the media, adding: “i would come next year, absolutely.” in pennsylvania, trump told supporters the media dinner would be boring but was noncommittal on whether he would go in 2018 or hold another rally. late night television show host samantha bee also hosted a competing event   “not the white house correspondents’ dinner”   that she said would honor journalists, rather than skewer trump.

" special counsel robert mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former trump campaign adviser paul manafort, nbc news reported on friday, citing people familiar with the matter. this is the first indication that mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between president donald trump’s campaign team and russia, is beginning to compel witness testimony before the grand jury, nbc said. russia’s government has denied interfering in the election and the president has denied collusion took place. one executive whose firm received a subpoena told nbc mueller’s team is looking at the lobbying campaign, which ran from 2012 to 2014. some of the firms involved in the campaign received subpoenas for documents weeks ago, and mueller’s team is now seeking testimony, nbc quoted him as saying. manafort, whose virginia apartment was raided by fbi agents last month, is a key figure in the mueller probe. the longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with mueller’s work have said.

" warren buffett is closely monitoring whether u.s. president donald trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. “it’s an actual factor at berkshire,” buffett, the chairman of berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n), said in a tuesday interview with cnbc television. “and it’s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.” buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. but when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said “i think about them plenty” now. “we’ve got actions on both sides that we would take,” referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. berkshire has said it ended june with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. the conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as american express co (axp.n), coca cola co (ko.n) and wells fargo & co (wfc.n), while other bets such as international business machines corp (ibm.n) have fared less well. buffett had said at berkshire’s annual meeting in omaha, nebraska, on may 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. that might be a good strategy now, if trump and many congressional republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. buffett explained that he would “feel kind of silly” realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. he said other investors sitting on “hundreds of billions” of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. it is unclear whether the republican controlled congress can pass a tax bill that trump will sign, and buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the affordable care act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president’s priorities. he expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. “i would think the republicans controlling both houses [of congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,” buffett said. “i think they can get it done.” ",0

" some northern chinese cities failed to improve air quality by much last month, hitting the smog prone region s overall results in a drive against pollution, the government said as it warned provincial officials to comply with stringent steps to clear the skies.  some cities did not improve air quality by much or even experienced some volatility, and in a way, they have dragged down the regional air quality level,  ministry of environmental protection (mep) spokesperson, liu youbin, said at a regular briefing on thursday. he did not identify the underperforming cities, but the comment comes amid concerns about the country s ability to reduce pollution in winter as it battles to avoid a repeat of the near record levels of choking smog that enveloped key northern areas at the start of the year.  there is no jesting in war. for those local officials who do not enforce the measures of the campaign effectively and could not improve air quality in time, we will hold them accountable,  liu added. data earlier this month showed only four of 28 northern chinese cities met their air quality targets in october and air quality in 338 chinese cities worsened in october, with levels of hazardous breathable particles, known as pm 2.5, up 5.6 percent on the year to an average of 38 micrograms per cubic meter.      beijing is under huge pressure to meet politically crucial air quality targets and clear the skies of toxic smog that blankets the north of the country as homes turn up the heat which is powered by coal. liu said overall air quality in the northern cities was improving compared with september. average pm 2.5 levels in the region dropped 15.8 percent in october from the month before, he said.   it shows that our measures are working. as long as we are persistent, and diligently enforce existing measures, regional air quality will definitely improve,  he said.  under the six month campaign, 28 northern chinese cities were ordered to thin traffic and cut industrial output. thousands of pollution sources including steel mills, coal fired boilers, cement and ceramic plants, mines and building sites will be shut. these measures, part of beijing s years long time war on smog, have already roiled commodities market, fuelling worries that the tough inspections are hurting the already slowing economy.

" more than half the schools in the state at the epicentre of nigeria s conflict with islamist militant group boko haram are still closed, the united nations  children agency said on friday, as the insurgency drags into its ninth year.  the lack of schools could continue to fuel boko haram or similar movements in the future as it means young people in the restive northeast region have few prospects, experts say. the conflict with boko haram, whose name roughly translates as  western education is forbidden  in the hausa language that is widely spoken in northern nigeria, has killed more than 20,000 people since 2009.  it has embroiled the region in one of the world s worst humanitarian crises, with at least 10.7 million people in need of assistance, according to the united nations.  in addition to devastating malnutrition, violence and an outbreak of cholera, the attacks on schools are in danger of creating a lost generation of children, threatening their and the countries  future,  justin forsyth, a deputy director for the united nations children s fund (unicef), said in a statement. more than 57 percent of schools are shut in borno state, where most of the conflict and resulting crisis have taken place, as the new academic year begins, the statement said.  more than 2,295 teachers have been killed, at least 19,000 displaced and almost 1,400 schools destroyed, unicef said. forsyth later said in an interview that three million children in the northeast required some form of education, adding that some attended rudimentary schools.  he said borno state government had returned about 750,000 children to school, but gave no details about the period of time over which they returned.  on the issue of educating children who had been recruited to fight in the conflict, forsyth said military and state government officials had agreed to the release of 600 children and mothers next week.   this is also a process of rehabilitation because these children have been traumatised,  he said.  despite aid agencies  efforts to set up schools for children in the northeast, particularly those displaced by the insurgency, unicef said it has only received three fifths of the total funding it needs for 2017. combined with climate change taking its toll in recent years on farming, a mainstay of the region, the lack of schooling has left many without job opportunities.

" the trial of a mexican man accused of murdering a woman while illegally in the united states began in san francisco on monday, a case that president donald trump has cited as an example of the dangers posed by lax border security. juan francisco lopez sanchez, also known as jose ines garcia zarate, has said he shot kate steinle by accident on a pier in the california city on july 1, 2015. he has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder, a charge that can bring between 15 years to life in prison. court officials confirmed the trial had started but did not offer further details of the proceedings.   he did not know the object in his hand was a gun,  matt gonzalez, an attorney for the defendant, was quoted as saying by nbc bay area before he headed into the courtroom.  he does not bear criminal responsibility.  assistant district attorney diana garcia declined to comment on the case. prosecutors have accused the defendant of recklessly pointing a stolen gun at people on the pier. prosecutors and defense attorneys were in court and not immediately available for comment. garcia zarate had been deported to mexico five times since first entering the united states as a juvenile, the san francisco chronicle and other local media reported.  steinle has been frequently invoked by name by trump as part of his signature pledges to halt illegal immigration and crack down on so called  sanctuary cities  that refuse to comply with certain federal immigration laws. in june, the u.s. house of representatives voted 228 195 to pass the  no sanctuary for criminals act,  which would withhold some federal grants to sanctuary cities. by a vote of 257 167, the chamber also passed  kate s law,  named for kate steinle, to increase penalties for illegal immigrants who return to the united states. under the laws, immigrants in the country illegally would face mandatory detention for past convictions of an expanded number of offenses. san francisco, like other sanctuary jurisdictions, has defended its approach as making the city safer, saying its practice of not inquiring about immigration status makes immigrants, including those in the country illegally, more willing to report crimes.

"in a stunning last minute power grab by the obama administration with just 14 days left in his presidency, the department of homeland security released a statement this evening officially declaring state election systems to be  critical infrastructure.  the statement from dhs secretary jeh johnson defines  election infrastructure  as  storage facilities, polling places, centralized vote tabulations locations, voter registration databases, voting machines  and all  other systems  to manage the election process so pretty much everything.i have reached this determination so that election infrastructure will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections that the department of homeland security provides to a range of private and public sector entities. by  election infrastructure,  we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments. given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law,  johnson stated.  particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do. the designation  allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss election infrastructure security   potentially injecting secrecy into an election process that s traditionally and expressly a transparent process,  according to the ap. u.s. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. dhs would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states. the announcement of a federal takeover of the electoral process follows a report from several intelligence agencies also released friday which purports the russian government worked to influence the outcome of the 2016 us election.the ap reports several states in recent months opposed the move fearing  the designation would lead to increased federal regulation or oversight on the many decentralized and locally run voting systems across the country. at least one member of the us election infrastructure cybersecurity working group, georgia secretary of state brian p. kemp, stated he opposed the measure claiming  more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible,  the ap writes.kemp reportedly called the move  a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states  on a conference call with johnson thursday, and said the designation  smacks of partisan politics. examples of election infrastructure include storage facilities, voter registration databases, voting locations, voting machines and other systems designed to manage the election process, the ap notes.  for entire story: infowarsdecember 18, 2016   georgia s secretary of state has claimed the department of homeland security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to homeland security secretary jeh johnson asking for an explanation.brian kemp issued a letter to johnson on thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an ip address from the agency s southwest d.c. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. according to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.and now, channel 2 investigative reporter aaron diamond has learned two more states  election agencies have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same u.s. department of homeland security ip address as last month s massive attack in georgia.watch here:georgia secretary of state brian kemp recently told politico it is nothing more than an attempt to  subvert the constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security. during an earlier interview with the site nextgov, kemp warned:  the question remains whether the federal government will subvert the constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security.  kemp told politico he sees a  clear motivation from this white house  to expand federal control, citing obama s health care law, the dodd-frank financial-reform legislation and the increased role of the education department in local schools.to some election officials, this sounds like the first stage of a more intrusive plan. i think it s kind of the nose under the tent,  said vermont secretary of state jim condos, a democrat.  what i think a lot of folks get concerned about [is] when the federal government says,  well, look, we re not really interested in doing that, but we just want to give you this,  and then all of a sudden this leads to something else.  meanwhile, kemp continued on by noting that  this administration only has 15 days left in its term  and to make such a critical decision during the 11th hour  smacks of partisan politics. but we re sure it s nothing, obama doesn t really strike us as the type to play the  partisan politics  game.  zero hedge",1
" a bill to make california a sanctuary state, by preventing police from inquiring about immigration status and curtailing law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers, was signed into law by the governor on thursday. the signing of the bill by governor jerry brown, a democrat, enacts on a state wide level protections for illegal immigrants that exist in several cities, including chicago and new york. illinois approved a similar measure earlier this year. the enhanced protections for illegal immigrants by california, the nation’s most populous state, sets the stage for a political battle with president donald trump, who has made a crackdown on illegal immigration one of his main priorities.  senate bill 54, which california lawmakers approved last month, bars local governments from forcing undocumented immigrants to spend extra time in jail so that immigration agents can pick them up for deportation. it also prohibits police from asking about the immigration status of people during routine interactions. “these are uncertain times for undocumented californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety, while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day,” brown said in a statement. the law will take effect in january. california leads the nation in its population of illegal immigrants, with more than 2.3 million people lacking legal status, according to pew research center. the u.s. department of justice immediately criticized brown’s action. “the state of california has now codified a commitment to returning criminal aliens back onto our streets, which undermines public safety, national security and law enforcement,” department of justice spokesman devin o’malley said in a statement. attorney general jeff sessions this year sought to cut off sanctuary cities from certain federal grants, but judges have blocked that effort. the law will not affect major aspects of u.s. immigration enforcement, brown noted in his statement. it does not prohibit sheriffs from allowing federal immigration authorities into their jails and does not freeze deportation proceedings for prison inmates, brown said.

" one of the latest victims of the cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in yemen had yet to even take her first breath. her mother safaa issa kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the western port city of hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor.  my stomach started hurting more and more,  said kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm. once there, she was referred by nurse hayam al shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration   one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in september and october, according to doctors at the city s thawra hospital.   i felt like death,  kaheel said, her voice strained.  thank god i survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn t stopped.    the red cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in yemen by the end of the year.  two and a half years of war have sapped yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable. the cholera ward is full of children   some writhing in agony, others eerily still. the blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing. save the children said in august that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with  malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well fed ones.  millions of yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness. yemen s war pits the armed houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of president abd rabbu mansour hadi, which is backed by a saudi led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.  at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. the country s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid. soumaya beltifa, spokesperson for the red cross in sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely yemen would be healthy again soon.  the cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations,  she warned.",0
" president barack obama is maintaining pressure on the senate to approve his supreme court nominee, but the need for republican u.s. senators seeking re election to keep conservative voters happy before primary elections in the coming months is working against him. from april 26 to sept. 13, nine states where incumbent republicans’ grip on u.s. senate seats is tenuous will hold party primaries ahead of the nov. 8 congressional and presidential elections. during that period, republicans seem unlikely to break with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell’s hard line stance against holding confirmation hearings or a vote on obama’s nominee, appellate judge merrick garland. mcconnell has insisted that obama’s successor, to be elected in november and take office in january, should fill the vacancy left by february’s death of justice antonin scalia. republicans are hoping their party’s candidate wins the presidency and can make the appointment. a supreme court appointment requires senate confirmation. voicing support for holding garland hearings during the primary season, political experts say, could enrage conservatives already upset over the prospect of obama making a third lifetime appointment to the nine member court, which could give the bench a liberal tilt for the first time in decades. that anger could bolster primary candidates challenging incumbent republicans from the right or encourage new challengers to come forward. political science professor sheldon goldman of the university of massachusetts at amherst, who has tracked supreme court nominations since the 1960s, said of the garland fight: “the real obstacle is getting over the primaries.” the danger of straying from mcconnell’s blockade was illustrated when kansas republican jerry moran last month backed hearings on garland but reversed course after rumblings of a right wing challenge materializing in moran’s aug. 2 primary. other key battlegrounds for senate republicans include wisconsin, pennsylvania, florida and new hampshire. new hampshire’s kelly ayotte is viewed as one of the most vulnerable senate republican incumbents. ayotte will meet with garland but said she wants the senate to wait until after november’s elections to act on the nomination. arizona senator john mccain, facing at least two opponents in his aug. 30 republican primary, downplayed the political difficulties presented by garland’s nomination. he said when he was home during the recent senate recess, he heard few complaints. of his constituents, mccain said, “they would ask. i would explain.” obama and fellow democrats in the senate continue to press republicans to allow hearings by summer. “so what you have here is, i think, a circumstance in which those (republicans) in the senate have decided that ‘placating our base’ is more important than upholding their constitutional and institutional roles in our democracy in a way that is dangerous,” obama said in chicago on thursday. some democrats think mcconnell’s gambit gives them a campaign issue for the elections. dick durbin, the senate’s no. 2 democrat, said, “if there was any question about obstruction in the united states senate, what’s happening with the vacancy on the supreme court is exhibit a of republican obstructionism.” ",0
" two leading house democrats introduced legislation on tuesday intended to curb corporate tax inversion deals by preventing companies from lowering the effective tax rates of u.s. business operations after moving their headquarters overseas. a bill, authored by the top democrats on the house ways and means and budget committees, would limit the ability of newly inverted companies to engage in a tax strategy called “earnings stripping,” which the lawmakers said often follows an inversion deal.    corporate inversions, an issue for anti establishment voters in this year’s presidential and congressional election campaigns, typically occur when a u.s. company buys a foreign firm and then relocates its headquarters to the foreign company’s home country, if only on paper, in a bid to reduce overall taxes. the obama administration has taken policy steps to discourage such deals. but only congress can eliminate the option through tax reform, a prospect unlikely until after the nov. 8 election. “we cannot continue to allow companies to shift their tax obligations onto american workers and families simply by changing their mailing address,” said representative chris van hollen of maryland, senior democrat on the house budget committee. van hollen introduced the “stop corporate earnings stripping act of 2016” with representative sander levin of michigan, the senior democrat on the house ways and means committee. the lawmakers said newly inverted companies have stripped their u.s. operations of taxable earnings by loading them with debt that produces tax deductible interest payments. the payments are made to the new foreign parent or another foreign affiliate as interest income that often pays a reduced or zero tax rate. the new legislation would reduce or eliminate financial thresholds that allow companies to pursue the earnings stripping strategy after inversion.

" a milwaukee based immigrants rights group canceled plans to take children to demonstrations outside the republican national convention, which starts on monday, citing fears of violence after last week’s shootings in dallas. voces de la frontera (voices from the border) typically includes children in its marches, seeking to humanize the debate over immigration policy, but opted against that in cleveland because “things can escalate,” group member daniel gutierrez said. donald trump is expected to officially become the republican candidate for president at the convention, which runs from monday to thursday, when myriad protest groups from around the country are expected to converge on cleveland. protests at trump campaign events have turned volatile, and tensions could be heightened by the presence of citizens carrying firearms. ohio gun laws will allow people to openly carry firearms at the protests, while more innocuous items such as tennis balls, umbrellas with steel points and water guns will be prohibited. police said the presence of openly carried weapons complicated their job at the dallas protest shootings, when a former u.s. army reservist shot dead five police officers, seeking revenge for police killings of black men. about 45 members of voces de la frontera plan to participate in a coalition to stop trump rally on monday, said gutierrez, adding that he was unafraid that others may bring guns.     “if anything comes up that puts our lives at risk, we definitely are not going to stand there. if anything breaks out, just remove ourselves from there. go to a safe location,” gutierrez said. brad sigal, a spokesman for the minnesota immigrant rights action committee, said his organization was training marshals to keep the group safe, primarily by steering members clear of  potential confrontations. about 50 of its members would travel to cleveland, he said.     “there will be a lot of police there, there may be counterprotests, but we’re there to get our message out and that’s what we’re going to do,” sigal said. “we’re aware of the situation and preparing for it.” rustbelt medics, a group of street medics that volunteers first aid at political events, has been conducting medical training in preparation for the convention. gloria tavera, a medical student and street medic with the group, says rustbelt medics will have trained about 50 people prior to the convention. “part of the training definitely involves what happens when people get hit by rubber bullets,” tavera said.

" the leader of the small constitutional democratic party of japan, which out performed expectations in an october vote, now hopes that by offering clear policy alternatives he can oust prime minister shinzo abe s coalition in the next election. one key to achieving that ambitious goal, said party founder yukio edano, is an economic platform that puts more weight on redistributing wealth, including by raising corporate taxes to push firms to use their cash reserves to raise wages.   unless we have reasonable redistribution to achieve growth, domestic demand will not expand,  edano, 53, told reuters in an interview.   that is a clear difference from the ldp,  he said, referring to the ruling liberal democratic party. the cdpj was formed less than three weeks before the oct. 22 election, after the then main opposition democratic party s leader decided not to field candidates and encouraged them to run on tokyo governor yuriko koike s novice conservative party s slate. it grabbed the top opposition spot in the lower house poll, although its 54 seats are dwarfed by the 283 won by abe s conservative ldp.  since we are the biggest opposition party, we must aim at a change in government in the next election, or else democracy is not functioning,  said edano, who said he was surprised by his party s success.   that is our responsibility.  the next general election must be held by october 2021. the cdpj opposes abe s proposal to revise article 9 of japan s post war constitution, which bans a standing military but has been interpreted to allow armed forces exclusively for self defence, and unlike the more authoritarian ldp, stresses civil rights rather than obligations to the state. the party appears to have a long way to go, given support at 7.9 percent against 38.1 percent for the ldp in a survey by nhk public broadcaster this week.  edano s fighting words, however, mark a contrast from the failed democratic party s stance in recent polls, when it aimed only to keep abe s coalition from winning a two thirds  super majority  rather than ousting it. edano said he would not repeat the mistakes of the democrats, which from the start was an amalgam of conservatives, liberals and ex socialists and ended up being plagued by infighting during its 2009 2012 term in office.  our positions were clear,  he said, explaining why he thought the cdpj outperformed opposition rivals.  we must not make our ideas and policies vague just to broaden (the party).  edano said abe s biggest defect was his apparent belief that a majority entitled him to do whatever he wanted. abe, whose support was at 49 percent in the nhk poll, saw his ratings sink this year partly due to perceptions he had grown arrogant.  democracy doesn t mean you get a blank cheque,  edano said.

" several small opposition parties in bangladesh have called for a half day strike on thursday against a power tariff increase, which could cause traffic chaos in the congested capital as pope francis arrives for a three day visit. the strike will begin on thursday morning and end in the early afternoon, after the pope is expected to land in dhaka following a visit to neighboring myanmar. strikes in bangladesh often involve street protests. the communist party of bangladesh, which is leading the protest against the increase in electricity prices by an average of 5.3 percent from next month, said it had no intention of disrupting the pope s visit but the action was necessary given the  burden  on the people. but police said there would be no problem.  we will be able to control the situation during the strike and there is nothing to worry about,  said police spokeswoman sahely ferdous. dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with an average traffic speed of just 7 kph (4.3 mph), slightly faster than an average walking speed, according to the world bank. congestion in dhaka eats up 3.2 million working hours per day, it says.

" seven european union states urged romania s ruling coalition on thursday to avoid legislation that could weaken its judiciary and the fight against corruption, hours after senators approved a contentious overhaul of the justice system. senators passed the last of three bills which critics say limit the independence of magistrates and which have triggered street protests across romania, widely regarded as one of the eu s most corrupt states. the three bills change the process of appointing chief prosecutors and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates, making them the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them. france, germany, the netherlands, belgium, denmark, finland, and sweden said in a joint statement from their embassies in bucharest that the bills and criminal code changes under debate in parliament undermined romania s progress on judicial reforms.  we appeal to the parties involved in the justice reform project to avoid any action that could lead to weakening the independence of the justice system and of the fight against corruption,  the joint statement said. the seven states joined a chorus of criticism that included the european commission, the u.s. state department, thousands of romanian magistrates and centrist president klaus iohannis. romania s ruling social democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, alde, have so far ignored the warnings.  they are also working on changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order. opposition politicians challenged the bills in the constitutional court on thursday. romania s top court also said it will challenge legal changes to the status of magistrates.  it was unclear when the court would meet to rule on the challenges but it could be months before the bills are enforced, as the president must also sign off on them. iohannis has repeatedly criticized the bills. the proposed changes place romania alongside its eastern european peers hungary and poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying eu concerns over the rule of law. the commission launched an unprecedented action on poland on wednesday, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms it says pose a threat to democracy.

" a new ban on u.s. travel for nationals of seven middle eastern countries caught the airline industry unprepared, with flight crew from those states also barred from entering, the international air transport association said on saturday. u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) has briefed the global trade group that passport holders from states such as iran and iraq, including cabin crew, will be barred entry to the united states, iata said in an email to its member airlines, seen by reuters. the email underscores airlines’ confusion about the situation as well as the challenge some may face from crew scheduling. airlines also stand to lose business: for instance, around 35,000 travelers from iran visited the united states in 2015, according to the u.s. department of homeland security. “much of this development has come over the weekend and at a time when iata’s facilitation team has been on duty travel.  unfortunately, our response has been slower than we would have preferred,” the email said. “a number (of questions) have yet to be resolved.” the executive order by president donald trump bans travelers with passports from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days. iata was informed that lawful permanent residents of the united states   or green card holders   from those countries are not included in the ban. however, a trump administration official told reporters that green card holders from the countries need to check with a u.s. consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow cbp guidance. gulf airlines emirates, etihad airways and qatar airways said earlier on their websites that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the united states. an emirates spokeswoman said “a very small number” of its passengers had been affected by the ban.

" a crisis over the relationship between president donald trump’s aides and russia deepened on wednesday as a growing number of trump’s fellow republicans demanded expanded congressional inquiries into the matter. trump sought to focus attention on what he called criminal intelligence leaks about his ousted national security adviser, michael flynn. trump forced flynn out on monday after disclosures he had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office, and that he later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations. the drama of flynn’s departure was the latest in a series of white house missteps and controversies since the republican president was sworn in on jan. 20. at a news conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday, trump said flynn, a retired u.s. army lieutenant general, was a “wonderful man” who had been mistreated by the news media. but republican trump critics including senators john mccain and lindsey graham voiced fresh consternation. adding to the pressure were comments by senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker, who has been a trump supporter. corker said the russia issue was threatening trump’s agenda on foreign affairs and domestic matters like healthcare and tax policy. he questioned whether the white house was able to stabilize itself and said flynn should testify before congress. “let’s get everything out as quickly as possible on this russia issue,” corker told msnbc’s “morning joe” program. “maybe there’s a problem that obviously goes much deeper than what we now suspect.” democrats, doubting trump’s justice department or the republican led congress will pursue the matter vigorously, have demanded an independent investigation of possible illegal communications between flynn and the russian government and any efforts by flynn or other white house officials to conceal wrongdoing. the most powerful democrat in the senate, chuck schumer, said attorney general jeff sessions, a close ally of trump, must recuse himself from any investigation. the republican and democratic leaders of the u.s. senate judiciary committee asked sessions and fbi director james comey on wednesday to send the committee documents and provide a briefing on flynn’s resignation. citing reports that both the federal bureau of investigation and justice department were involved in events leading to flynn’s departure, senators chuck grassley and dianne feinstein said they raised “substantial questions” about flynn’s discussion with russian officials. graham called for a broader bipartisan congressional investigation to be conducted by a newly formed special committee rather than existing committees, if it turns out  trump’s presidential campaign communicated with the russians. but the top republicans in the senate and house of representatives have insisted the matter be investigated by existing republican led committees. the senate and house intelligence committees and a subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee have announced they launched investigations into alleged russian efforts to influence the election through computer hacking. u.s. intelligence agencies previously concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the nov. 8 election in trump’s favor. congressional inquiries into alleged russian interference in the u.s. elections are gaining momentum as capitol hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents.  the fbi and several u.s. intelligence agencies are investigating russian espionage operations in the united states. they are also looking at contacts in russia between russian intelligence officers or others with ties to president vladimir putin’s government and people connected to trump or his campaign. the fbi recently questioned flynn about his telephone contacts with the russian ambassador in washington. people familiar with the agency’s multiple probes said there was no evidence so far of pre election collusion between russians and trump’s campaign, or any evidence of criminal activity by flynn or anyone else connected to trump. some experts expressed concern the white house could curtail or divert probes into flynn and russian involvement in the election unless congress becomes more aggressive by holding hearings and appointing an independent commission or special prosecutor into whether trump’s team violated federal laws in their contacts with russia. intelligence agencies now overseen by trump may not be ideally suited to the job, they added. “it’s not, at the end of the day, the job of the intelligence community to regulate the white house   and it shouldn’t be,” said stephen vladeck, a university of texas law professor who focuses on constitutional law and national security. ‘very un american’ in twitter posts on wednesday, trump called the reported russian connection with his campaign team nonsense and said the leaks were the “real scandal.” from early on in his white house bid, trump said he would like improved relations with putin, a stance criticized by democrats and those republicans concerned about washington softening its stance after russia’s annexation of crimea from ukraine and aggression in syria. only a few republican lawmakers have supported even the idea of extending any investigation to cover actions by trump’s team in the weeks after the election, when flynn made his calls. some republicans, including house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes, are calling for investigations into leaks to the news media of conversations between flynn and russia’s ambassador in washington. the trump administration has offered flynn’s former job to u.s. navy vice admiral robert harward, said two u.s. officials familiar with the matter. it was not immediately clear if harward, a former deputy commander of u.s. central command, had accepted the offer, according to sources.

" russian president vladimir putin, a dog lover, received a top breed puppy as a belated birthday gift on wednesday from turkmenistan s president who is keen to recover lost russian markets for turkmen gas.  we have a common friend   this is the world s unique alabai dog. and today i brought this little alabai with me,  president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov said before talks with putin, pulling the pup out from a portable cage and holding it up by the scruff of its neck.  putin, who marked his 65th birthday on oct. 7, took the puppy, called verny which means  faithful  in russian, and kissed it in its forehead. the alabai is a home bred turkmen variety of the central asian shepherd dog. along with the handmade carpets and the ancient akhal teke breed of race horses, it is officially listed as part of turkmenistan s national heritage. plush and cuddly when they are young, alabai dogs grow into fierce shepherd dogs, fearless in warding off wolves but also in dealing with human strangers. berdymukhamedov, a flamboyant former dentist whose interests range from sport cars to noble horses, enjoys a personality cult and autocratic powers in his desert nation which sits on the world s fourth largest natural gas reserves. the two men held talks at the black sea resort of sochi, on the sidelines of a summit of ex soviet states, with the turkmen side keen to see a possible resumption of natural gas exports to russia. russia, once the main buyer of turkmen gas, stopped buying the fuel last year due to a price dispute. china, with its growing appetite for energy, is now the main market for turkmen gas.  some other foreign leaders including those of japan and bulgaria have also given putin puppies of rare breeds as gifts.

" the growing feud between republican front runner donald trump and his central rival ted cruz intensified on saturday with tit for tat attacks that put to rest any notion that their debate night fight was a solitary engagement. the split between the two is evidence of the closeness of the race for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, particularly in iowa. polls there show a neck and neck battle with little more than two weeks to go until iowa on feb. 1 stages the first nominating contest on the road to the nov. 8 election. trump, who needs a victory in iowa to set a winning tone to his campaign, kept up his attempt to undermine cruz’s attempt to portray himself as an outsider to the political establishment. trump seized on a report in the new york times that said cruz had failed to disclose a second loan, from citibank, that helped bankroll his 2012 senate campaign. the times earlier had reported that cruz had not disclosed a loan from goldman sachs for the same campaign. cruz’s campaign has said the failure to report the loan was a paperwork error. “he didn’t report his bank loans,” trump told delegates to the south carolina tea party convention. some booed trump for criticizing cruz since they had cheered cruz when he spoke to the group earlier. “say whatever you want,” trump said in response to the boos. “he didn’t report his bank loans... and then he acts like robin hood. say whatever you want..” cruz did not mention trump to the tea party event but talking to reporters in fort mill, s.c., earlier in the day he was unsparing. he suggested the new york billionaire and former reality tv star lacks the temperament to be president, pointing to his frequent twitter assaults on his adversaries. he said trump had attacked him because cruz was a threat to him in iowa. “i think in terms of a commander in chief, we ought to have someone who isn’t springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls,” cruz said. “i think the american people are looking for a commander in chief who is stable and steady and a calm hand to keep this country safe.” trying to prove trump is not the conservative he says he is,  cruz’s campaign released a video entitled “donald trump’s new york values” that linked to a 1999 interview trump did on nbc’s “meet the press” in which trump declared he favored a woman’s right to abortion and supported gay marriage. the two candidates had clashed at the last republican debate, on thursday in charleston, over the issue of “new york values” with trump saying cruz had insulted the city that absorbed the sept. 11, 2001, attacks and rebounded. trump brought up the issue again at a town hall meeting in portsmouth, n.h., hours before a scheduled address at the south carolina tea party convention in myrtle beach. cruz’s criticism of new york, he said, was a “total disgrace.”  (reporting by steve holland; editing by chizu nomiyama) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency.",0
" u.s. representative leonard lance, who has held more than 40 town hall style meetings with constituents in his central new jersey district, has never faced a crowd like he did on wednesday. the republican endured catcalls, chants and caustic questions from more than 1,000 residents at a local college, while hundreds of others outside brandished signs with messages like “resist trump.” parallel scenes have played out across the country this week during the first congressional recess since donald trump became president. republican lawmakers returning home confronted a wave of anger over a spectrum of issues, including immigration, healthcare and trump’s possible ties to russia. the raucous meetings are the latest in a relentless series of rallies, marches and protests that shows no signs of abating more than 30 days into the new administration. the anti trump energy has prompted talk of a liberal style tea party movement, in reference to the protests in 2009 that helped reshape the republican party and arguably laid the groundwork for trump’s surprise electoral victory last year. “some of the lessons to draw from that are persistence, repetition, not taking ‘no’ for an answer,” said victoria kaplan, the organizing director for the grassroots progressive group moveon. since the day after trump’s inauguration, when millions of protesters joined women’s marches worldwide, left wing organizers have sought to harness that anger to fuel a lasting political campaign. hundreds of progressive groups have sprung up across the country   some affiliated with national organizations like indivisible or moveon   to help coordinate. at town halls in new jersey and virginia this week, constituents came armed with red “disagree” signs they held aloft to register their disapproval of what they heard from their representatives.  some u.s. senators, such as pat toomey, republican of pennsylvania, have faced weekly protests outside their offices, and a pennsylvania healthcare network set up a “town hall” this week with an empty suit in place of toomey, who declined to attend. more marches are scheduled across the country in the coming months, including several major events in washington, tied to gay rights, science and a push for trump to release his tax returns. the sheer volume of protests   last week, there were three nationwide calls for action within a five day span   has some political observers wondering how long it can last. but several experts who study protests said the level of outrage may be increasing, rather than subsiding, after a tumultuous first month in which trump’s words and actions created fresh outrage among liberals almost daily. “we’re not anywhere near reaching a saturation point for protest,” said michael heaney, the author of “party in the street: the antiwar movement and the democratic party after 9/11” and a university of michigan professor. “if anything, it’s just getting started.” the key for organizers is to convert large scale protests into sustained action by building databases of names and encouraging locally based events, experts said. “you can’t just have the diehards,” said dana r. fisher, a university of maryland professor who studies collective action. “and then you need to channel them into new types of activism.” when fisher surveyed participants at the women’s march in washington, she found one third were attending their first protest   the highest percentage she has ever observed. “this is unprecedented,” she said. “but there’s nothing that’s not unprecedented about the trump presidency.” some republicans have dismissed the protests as manufactured. trump on tuesday tweeted that “so called angry crowds” in republicans’ districts were “planned out by liberal activists.” but kaplan of moveon said the vast majority of actions were “organic.” a weekly conference call the group hosts to discuss the movement has attracted a bigger number of participants each week, with 46,000 people joining the latest discussion. “we are firing on all cylinders to catch up” with grassroots protests, she said. “that is a demonstration of energy and sustainability.” experts also said social media has made it far easier to organize mass protests quickly and efficiently. in what kaplan said was a sign the protests are having an impact, many republicans have eschewed town halls this week to avoid confrontations. there were fewer than 100 in person republican town halls scheduled for the first two months of the year, compared with more than 200 in the same period in 2015, according to a vice report. in louisiana on wednesday, residents shouted down republican senator bill cassidy as he tried to explain his healthcare proposal. scott taylor, a freshman republican representative in virginia, sparred with hundreds of impassioned constituents on monday at his own event. like lance, whose district voted for hillary clinton over trump, taylor is already a midterm target for democrats. taylor said in an interview after the town hall that he recognized many of the attendees from the local democratic party. “it’s not like they’re just some new organic people who just came about and are concerned,” taylor said.  but not everyone was a democrat. austin phillips, a 22 year old trump voter, told taylor at the town hall he was worried about losing healthcare coverage if

" philippine president rodrigo duterte will visit japan for talks with prime minister shinzo abe this month, ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the asia pacific economic cooperation (apec) gathering in vietnam in november.  japan and the philippines have close ties and our strategic partnership can promote stability in the region,  japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said on wednesday during a regular press briefing.  duterte will arrive on oct 29 for a three day visit, suga said. japan is concerned about china s growing power in the south china sea and sees cooperation with the philippines, which lies on the waterway s eastern side, as key to helping prevent the spread of beijing s influence into the western pacific.  duterte, unlike his predecessor, benigno aquino, has courted china and has been less critical of its island building in the region. following the two day apec meeting from nov 11, which u.s. president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will attend, asia pacific leaders will travel to the philippines for the east asia summit, including representatives from the association of southeast asian nations (asean) and other asia pacific nations.  duterte s visit will mark his second trip to japan and his third meeting with abe.

" u.s. senate democrats delayed the senate finance committee’s vote on u.s. treasury secretary nominee steven mnuchin on monday so they could protest against president donald trump’s order banning travel from seven muslim majority nations. the panel will now vote on mnuchin’s nomination on tuesday at 10 a.m. est (1500 gmt), finance committee republican spokeswoman julia lawless said, calling democrats’ objections to the scheduled monday evening vote “irregular.” senate democratic leader chuck schumer organized a candlelight protest on the steps of the capitol to take place on monday evening.  “this delay will allow members to protest the president’s unconstitutional ban on muslims entering the united states while voting on mr. mnuchin’s nomination little more than 12 hours later,” said rachel mccleery, a spokesperson for senate finance committee democrats. the move also could buy more time for some senators to reconsider their votes on mnuchin, a former goldman sachs executive who later ran southern california based onewest bank. senator ron wyden, the panel’s ranking democrat, has sharply criticized mnuchin’s handling of thousands of foreclosures by onewest after he led a group of investors to buy failed mortgage lender indymac at the height of the recent financial crisis. senator mark warner, another democrat on the panel, on monday announced he would vote against mnuchin’s nomination. “throughout the confirmation process, mr. mnuchin has failed to adequately demonstrate that he will be a forceful advocate for innovative policies that will make the u.s. economy work better for the majority of americans,” warner said in a statement, adding that he is not convinced that mnuchin would robustly enforce post crisis financial services restrictions. republicans control a two vote majority on the committee, so democrats would need to persuade some republicans to oppose mnuchin to block the nomination. nevada republican dean heller, who faces a re election campaign in 2018, subjected mnuchin to tough questioning on onewest’s foreclosures in nevada during his confirmation hearing. a heller spokesman did not immediately respond to questions about the senator’s voting plans.

" president donald trump exhorted every republican to vote yes on a healthcare overhaul when it comes before the senate this week, but one of his party’s most vocal opponents of the bill, senator susan collins, said he had made no effort to reach her. “the democrats aren’t giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the republicans, not easy to do,” trump declared monday in the white house, appearing with families he said had been harmed by obamacare. hours later on capitol hill, collins, one of a handful of republican holdouts and the party’s most reliable moderate in the senate, said she had not heard from trump. “i’ve had conversations with vice president (mike) pence, and seema verma, and reince priebus has called me a few times, to discuss the bill, but the president understandably i think is focusing on others,” collins said in an interview on monday evening with reuters. verma is the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and priebus is white house chief of staff.  asked if trump had given up on her, collins said: “i don’t know but it sounded that way from one of his press statements that i saw. he said something like   ‘susan collins, she’s from maine.’ as if that explained it.” after a mostly hands off approach to the senate debate on healthcare over the past few weeks, trump urged fellow republicans on monday to deliver on their promise of the past seven years to repeal and replace the 2010 affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama’s signature healthcare law, popularly known as obamacare. a defeat in the senate would be a major setback for trump and congressional republicans, who view obamacare as government intrusion in the healthcare market. critics warn the republican bill will deprive millions of health insurance. collins, who voted two years ago against a repeal of obamacare, repeated on monday she would vote “no” on a motion to proceed to any of the known versions of the legislation now being circulated to repeal or overhaul the healthcare law.  the 64 year old maine lawmaker refused to try to predict what the outcome would be when the senate votes on tuesday on whether to open debate on a republican healthcare bill. once that episode is over, she said she hoped lawmakers would start work on a bipartisan bill on healthcare. “my hope is that we’ll end up going back to committee and doing what we should have in the first place: which is having hearings, perhaps coming up with several smaller bills to address the very real problems created by the affordable care act,” she said. representatives of the trump administration, asked whether the president intended to contact recalcitrant senators such as collins, said others in the administration had done so.  “we’ve talked to virtually every single republican senator,” health and human services secretary tom price told reporters, noting that collins had been at the white house on a number of occasions.  collins said lawmakers would first need to address the collapse of insurance markets in many counties across the country. she said congress should fund cost sharing subsidies that help keep down consumers’ out of pocket costs. collins, who said she had held individual discussions with at least eight senate democrats about some kind of bipartisan healthcare effort, said she believed trump would sign a bipartisan healthcare bill. “at times he called for a bipartisan bill, and so i think he’d be fine with a bipartisan bill.” she was forthright about her problems with the senate republican approach, including its sweeping cuts to medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and the expected increase in costs for older americans who buy private health insurance. maine’s population is older, mostly rural, and one fifth of the population is on medicaid. the median age is 43, the oldest in the country.  “in northern maine, where the (insurance) rates are highest, and the population is older, the information from what i’ve seen, it (the cost of insurance) would be like a third of their income in some cases. so i’m very concerned about that,” collins said.

" donald trump’s new top political strategist predicted on friday the republican presidential front runner would amass the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch his party’s nomination well before the republican national convention in july. veteran campaign tactician paul manafort was chosen by trump on thursday to oversee a fractious nomination process that many republicans expect may not yield a clear winner before the convention. manafort said on cnn’s “new day” program that rival ted cruz, the u.s. senator from texas, will not be able to dent trump’s delegate lead before california’s june 7 primary. “the reality is: ted cruz has seen his best day,” manafort said. “the reality is: this convention process will be over with sometime in june, probably june 7, and it’ll be apparent to the world that trump is over that 1,237 number.” trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on social media after his double digit loss to cruz in the wisconsin primary on tuesday, which followed a series of missteps on the campaign trail including his statement, later recanted, advocating punishment for women who have illegal abortions. in elevating manafort, trump said he would add more staff before the convention in an expansion of his campaign team beyond the close knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last june. “people that i know that want to get involved and wanted to before but didn’t have a way in,” manafort said.  the next presidential nominating contests before the nov. 8 election include a number in east coast states seen as more fertile ground for the real estate tycoon, including in his native new york on april 19. manafort cited pennsylvania, new jersey, connecticut and maryland as states where trump would do well. “by the time we get to california the momentum is going be very clear and ted cruz’ path to victory is going to be in shambles,” he said. cruz, appearing on the cnn program earlier, said he had a clear path to 1,237 delegates. “it’s difficult. we’ve got to win and we’ve got to win consistently,” cruz said. “he’s right. he has to win,” manafort said.

" until late last month, syed karim grew rice and sugarcane on a strip of unclaimed land along the international border where myanmar ends and bangladesh begins.  on aug. 25, the 26 year old rohingya muslim man abandoned his home in a nearby myanmar village and moved to the no man s land, fleeing a crackdown by the military against his community in response to militant attacks. an estimated 370,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh since that day. but karim and thousands of his neighbors from rohingya villages near the border face a unique predicament. they have fled to the safety of the buffer zone along the border and are now stuck. bangladesh security forces have instructions to not let them in, said monzurul hassan khan, a bangladesh border guard officer.  some of the rohingya there said they are too afraid to go back to their homes but not ready to abandon them altogether and become refugees in bangladesh.  i can see my house but can t go there,  said karim, whose taung pyo let yar village could be seen from his shack in the no man s land. the top u.n. human rights official has called myanmar s operations against the rohingya as  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and the security council is to meet behind closed doors on wednesday to discuss the situation. the 40 acre (16.2 hectare) buffer zone, about the size of 40 soccer pitches, is strung along the border, with a barbed wire fence on the myanmar side and a creek on the other.  hundreds of tarpaulin bamboo shacks have come up on what used to be a paddy field, with hills in the south. khan said 8,000 to 10,000 rohingya had camped there. the un refugee agency, which runs camps in bangladesh, doesn t go there because of security reasons, said vivian tan, a spokeswoman for unhcr. tan said that they work with some ngos to provide people in the area with plastic sheets and clothing.  myanmar has laid landmines on its side of the border, which have wounded at least four people, bangladesh authorities and rohingya refugees said.     buddhist majority myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for the attacks on the security forces.        several bangladesh officials said they suspected that about 100 fighters from the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa), the insurgents who attacked myanmar police posts and an army base on aug. 25, have also been spotted in the border area. bangladeshi security officials said they learned from informers that suspected arsa fighters were in the area early last week, after the eid al adha festival.  the officials, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said 11 suspected fighters were also being treated in a hospital in chittagong city, north of cox s bazar, which is close to the border.                         an arsa spokesman denied that any of its fighters were using the no man s land to launch attacks and said none of its fighters were in bangladesh. mostafa kamal uddin, bangladesh s home secretary, said he did not have information about the presence of rohingya militants in bangladesh.  karim and other rohingya people, mostly from the border villages, said they started fleeing to the buffer zone after the aug. 25 attacks.           khan, the border guard officer, said their numbers swelled on aug. 27.  we kept hearing gunshots and also saw a fire and smoke on their side of the border,  khan said.  he pointed to two brown patches of burned trees in taung pyo let yar village from his operations base on a hilltop in bangladesh s gundum village near the border.  his men with automatic rifles kept watch as rohingya children waded across the creek to fetch fresh water in aluminum pots and plastic bottles from a hand pump on bangladeshi soil.  a toddler, with the knee deep waters rising to his neck, struggled with three plastic bottles, dropping one before turning around and picking it up and pressing forward. in interviews at the buffer zone, where reuters was taken by khan, residents of three villages   taung pyo let yar, mee taik and kun thee pin   said they were spared in the previous big military crackdown in october last year. but things changed on aug. 25.  mohammed arif, a rohingya man from taung pyo let yar village, said he fled into the woods near the village to hide when the army came. from there, he watched a mortar shell hit his two storey house, burning it down.  he crossed over the fence on aug. 26 with his family. arif said he had not seen any arsa fighters in the no man s land.  in our country, buddha worshippers treat us like a virus that needs to be eliminated. we have heard them saying,  no rohingya in myanmar.  but we will go back,  arif said.

" democratic u.s. presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign has solicited advice from california regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn based ethanol be blended into the nation’s gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials.     the move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the renewable fuel standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn growing states like iowa where she faces a tough battle against republican rival donald trump in the nov. 8 election. the renewable fuel standard, created by congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the united states contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. it was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the u.s. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. it is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  clinton advisers have contacted the california air resources board (carb) to discuss whether a policy like california’s low carbon fuel standard, a market based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the renewable fuel standard, and other issues, carb officials said. mary nichols, head of the carb, said she discussed the state’s regulations with clinton advisers. while a backer of the low carbon fuel standard, nichols said she told clinton’s advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal fired electricity. nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. a clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with carb but gave no further details.  a campaign spokesman, tyrone gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from “a diverse set of stakeholders.” he added that the clinton campaign “does not support replacing the rfs with a national low carbon fuel standard” but did not elaborate. former obama administration climate and energy adviser heather zichal said on the sidelines of the democratic national convention in philadelphia last week that the renewable fuel standard was broken, but that a clinton administration could make “modifications” to fix it. “mandates aren’t necessarily a perfect way to regulate,” zichal said at the event. the u.s. corn lobby hopes to convince both clinton and trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of u.s. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. the program is designed to last indefinitely after that. environmentalists, anti hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. market based system the california regulation, a key part of the state’s effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companies to decide how to reach that target.     california enacted the low carbon fuel standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the state’s market. it angered midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. clinton in may expressed support for the federal renewable fuel standard in an opinion piece published in an iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. clinton’s openness to overhauling the renewable fuel standard appears to contrast with trump’s position. during the state by state battle for the republican presidential nomination, trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the renewable fuel standard. corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the clinton and trump campaigns to argue in favor of the renewable fuel standard.

" the u.s. house of representatives could vote as soon as next week on legislation to toughen sanctions on north korea by targeting its shipping industry and companies that do business with the reclusive state, congressional aides said on thursday. the legislation, approved by the house foreign affairs committee last month, is intended to cut off supplies of cash that help fund north korea’s nuclear program, and increase pressure to stop human rights abuses such as the use of slave labor, the bill’s sponsor, foreign affairs chairman ed royce, said. it also calls on president donald trump’s administration to decide whether north korea is a state sponsor of terrorism. amid international concern over the escalation of north korea’s nuclear program, top trump administration officials held briefings on the issue on wednesday for the entire u.s. congress, busing the 100 senators to the white house and meeting with members of the 435 person house at the capitol complex. as he left the house briefing, royce said he expected the legislation to move quickly, as part of what he hoped would be a strong international effort to use every method possible to pressure pyongyang to curb its nuclear ambitions. “in particular, it will focus on financial institutions as well as what you might call ‘slave labor.’ these are cases where the north koreans send out work crews to do work, and instead of being paid, the money comes back to the north korean regime, and is spent on their nuclear program,” royce told reporters. the trump administration said it wanted to push north korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remained open to negotiations to bring that about. officials also said on wednesday they wanted to return the country to the u.s. list of terrorism sponsors. a spokesman for royce declined to comment on when there might be a vote, referring questions to house leadership, whose aides did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the timing. trump’s secretary of state, rex tillerson, is due to meet with the u.n. security council on friday to press for tougher international sanctions on north korea.

" the united states will respond strongly in the case of a further north korean nuclear test, u.s. deputy secretary of state antony blinken said on monday, days after the north’s failure to launch what the united states believes was an intermediate range ballistic missile. north korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in january and a long range rocket launch the next month, both in contravention of u.n. security council resolutions. expanded u.n. sanctions aimed at starving north korea of funds for its nuclear weapons program were approved in a unanimous security council vote in early march on a resolution drafted by the united states and china. blinken, who is meeting senior japanese government officials in tokyo, told reporters north korea would be digging itself deeper into a hole if it pursued further provocations. “there will be additional strong response in case of another (north korean) nuclear test,” blinken said, adding that such actions by north korea were “unacceptable”. blinken said the united states would consider “a number of possibilities” while adding that it was “premature” to be specific. some experts expect north korea to conduct its fifth nuclear test in the near future, possibly before its party congress in early may, following the embarrassing missile failure on friday.

" president barack obama on friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug dependent newborns and assist their parents. the comprehensive addiction and recovery act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nation’s heroin and opioid drug epidemic. obama said in a statement that 78 americans die from opioid overdose every day, and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic. “i am deeply disappointed that republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need,” obama said. “in fact, they blocked efforts by democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding.” the bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the house of representatives and the senate. efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a reuters investigation last year titled “helpless & hooked.” the new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored. that law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report, track and assist drug dependent newborns and their families. reuters found that no more than nine states were following that requirement. most children born to addicted mothers, including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone, were not being reported by hospitals as required by law. often, that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services, as the existing law requires. when cases were reported to social services, reuters found, efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited. the failures came at a cost. reuters found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill equipped to care for them. experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted. the new law promises a non punitive approach that includes “safe care plans” aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents, who will receive additional help. “this is a step forward for vulnerable babies who, due to an opioid dependency, will begin their lives facing enormous challenges,” said senator bob casey of pennsylvania, the ranking democrat on the senate subcommittee on children and families. “reuters’ initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives. there is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward.” representative john kline, a minnesota republican who chairs the house committee on education and the workforce, which initiated the measure, said it will track state actions. “these reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nation’s opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future,” kline said in a statement. in 2013, the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting, 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome, a five fold increase from a decade earlier. reuters found that one drug dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the united states. some suffer shaking, crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal. senator ron wyden of oregon, the ranking democrat on the senate finance committee, said the broader addiction law was “no more than a half measure” without more funding. wyden has co sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children. it passed the house but stalled in the senate. jim greenwood, a former pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law, said the deaths reuters revealed represent “a national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal, state and local level to implement plans of safe care for infants.” greenwood, now president of a washington, d.c. based biotechnology group, applauded the new measure “to improve the health and safety of these babies and their families.” stephen patrick, an assistant professor of pediatrics at vanderbilt university and leading researcher on the condition, said the new law is “good news” but added: “wish there was funding that came with it.” ",0
" u.s. vice president joe biden on thursday said he felt “almost obliged” to say sorry for verbal attacks on mexico in the u.s. presidential campaign, in which republican front runner donald trump has labeled mexican migrants rapists and drug runners. speaking alongside mexican president enrique pena nieto during a visit to mexico city, biden never mentioned trump, who nonetheless loomed large over the proceedings. “there’s been a lot of damaging and incredibly inaccurate rhetoric, and i would argue, i feel almost obliged to apologize for some of what my political colleagues have said ... about mexico, about the mexican people,” said biden, a democrat. property mogul trump, who has built up a big early lead in the race to become republican nominee, has vowed to make mexico pay for a wall to seal off the united states from its southern neighbor, prompting widespread criticism in both countries. “i just want you to know, mr. president, that the most heated rhetoric you’ve heard from some of the competitors for the nomination for president, is not who we are as the american people .... it’s the exact opposite,” biden added. without naming trump, pena nieto also weighed in, saying “building walls is just isolating oneself.” the 2016 u.s. presidential election is on nov. 8.     at an event earlier on thursday, biden had expressed concern about what the election race said about views held in the united states, calling some of the republican campaign language “dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill advised.”  “the message that is coming out of the united states as a consequence of the presidential campaign, about american attitudes toward mexicans and mexico generally, (and) the entire hemisphere and our place in the world, is disturbing,” he said. trump, 69, has vowed to deport the 11 million migrants living illegally in the united states, a position shared by his younger republican rival, the texas senator ted cruz. for more on the 2016 presidential race, see the reuters blog, ""tales from the trail"" (here).

" there were stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members only, jacket and tie clubs and fundraisers at the four seasons, the st. regis and the mandarin oriental.      in the world of jeb bush, the campaign for the 2016 republican presidential nomination has at times been a whirl of private planes and high end affairs, according to the federal filings of bush’s campaign and his super pac, right to rise, which can raise unlimited funds for bush as long as it does not coordinate directly with him.  it is not unusual for u.s. presidential candidates to fly private or even sometimes stay in luxury hotels. but some disgruntled donors say they are unhappy with bush’s large outlays, which also include big spending on staff and tens of millions of dollars in ad buys.  eleven of 16 major donors contacted by reuters questioned whether it was money well spent, especially given how the one time frontrunner has stumbled badly in the polls and is now facing questions about whether he should withdraw from the race.   in contrast to bush, senator ted cruz, who is running second in national polls of republican voters, favors cheaper accommodation options like holiday inn and often flies on budget carriers, campaign finance filings through the third quarter show.  several members of the bush camp vigorously rejected the donor critiques. bush spokeswoman kristy campbell said, “we are running a national campaign that is competing everywhere and we have made investments that have allowed us to do what serious campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections.”  ad tracking firm smg delta says bush’s campaign and right to rise have spent $82 million on ads, significantly more than the three leading candidates in the republican race: donald trump ($5 million); senator ted cruz ($11 million) and senator marco rubio ($49 million). the tracking firm’s data is more up to date than what has been reported so far in the federal filings.  “there is no return on investment on the bush ad buys, zero,” said one high dollar donor who asked not to be named, pointing to how the ads have done little, at least so far, to lift bush in the polls or dent his opponents.  on sunday, donors will learn just how much bush has spent from his $100 million plus war chest. that’s when republican and democratic candidates and their super pacs release their latest campaign finance reports. what is known so far is that bush and right to rise spent at least $82 million, both in operating expenditures through the third quarter of 2015 and on ad spending through this month.    the campaign finance reports also show that between june 2015, when bush formally announced his candidacy, and september, the bush campaign spent $1.2 million on private planes versus the roughly $700,000 spent during the same period by democratic frontrunner hillary clinton.      cruz spent $158,000 on private planes, and rubio $293,300. trump flies around the country in his own boeing 757.       the former florida governor’s spending pattern illustrates the limits of campaign donations: even in an era when candidates can receive unlimited sums from wealthy donors, money doesn’t guarantee success.      “they are burning money,” said a second major donor, who, like all the other high dollar donors interviewed, asked not be named for fear of displeasing the bush family.  “look, this is not the election cycle to be spending like a silver spoon establishment candidate,” said a third donor. “it just doesn’t look right,” the donor said, referring to the way income inequality has emerged as a key theme in the 2016 election.  ambassador jeanne phillips, a member of the right to rise governance committee, laughed off the criticism.  “i’ve known jeb for 30 years, so the idea that jeb would allow anyone around him to be frivolous with money is hilarious, it’s ridiculous. the man is the most conservative, fiscally responsible person i’ve ever worked with.”  bush’s campaign committee paid for all lodging on the campaign trail and the vast majority of private air charter, while right to rise paid for nearly all the known ad spending.      money donated by both large and small donors kept the bush camp traveling in style. there were stays at luxury hotels including the wilshire in beverly hills, the viceroy in florida, the st. regis in dana point, california, and the w in stamford, connecticut, the campaign finance filings show.  the filings do not offer a complete picture. it is not clear for example, how many nights were spent at each of the hotels or indeed whether it was bush himself who stayed or staff members.  bush isn’t the only candidate spending at high end hotels, but it’s a high proportion of his overall hotel spending. he spent $125,000,or 70 percent of his total hotel spending between june and september on hotels defined as luxury or “upper upscale” luxury hotels by str global, which tracks supply and demand data in the hotel industry.  cruz and rubio each spent less on luxury hotels and a smaller proportion of their overall lodging expenses on them, at roughly 56 percent and 61 percent, respectively, federal filings through the third quarter show. trump flies home nearly every night so he can sleep in his own bed.      the bush campaign and his super pac also spent more than $400,000 on renting facilities and catering at posh venues, including the union league club and the upscale beachfront 1 hotel south beach in miami, where the super pac spent $60,000 last year. rubio and cruz spent roughly $265,000 and $185,000 respectively.      bush defenders said the spending on high end venues was simply how the donor world operated.  “if you can hold an event at a fancy hotel and raise millions, then it’s well worth holding it at a swanky hotel” said charlie spies, counsel for right to rise.  spies said right to rise had negotiated “below market” rates with vendors and consultants, including an overall compensation cap for staff.        nevertheless the bush camp has spent more on staff and consultants than any of the leading candidates. starting roughly in the spring, bush paid out about $8 million. cruz spent just $2 million; rubio, just under $2 million; and trump, $1.7 million.  overall, trump, cruz, and rubio have spent a small fraction of the $82 million bush has reported paying out. cruz spent $18.5 million and rubio outlayed $32 million, according to the filings made so far.  bush is certainly not the only candidate to spend big on the trail. wisconsin governor scott walker, for instance, ran an expensive campaign and burned through nearly $10 million before quitting after three months.      bush’s prospects were far brighter last summer. trump had yet to join the race and bush was making headlines for the size of his war chest. his super pac had just cracked its goal of raising more than $100 million in just six months — an unprecedented haul in american politics.      to celebrate, jeb’s parents and family welcomed their large network of well heeled donors to their oceanside compound in kennebunkport, maine, where attendees were treated to rides in private trolley cars, lobster rolls and group photos with the sprawling bush clan.  (this version of the story was refiled to clarify spending in paragraph 25 to show it was by both the campaign and super pac)  ",0
" a bipartisan pair of lawmakers on the u.s. senate banking committee are planning to introduce a bill that aims to entice private corporations to give their employees larger equity stakes in their companies and promote longer term investing. the draft bill, titled the “encouraging employee ownership act,” is being rolled out by virginia democrat mark warner and pennsylvania republican pat toomey and will be made public as soon as thursday, according to a spokeswoman for warner’s office. the measure comes at the same time that the u.s. securities and exchange commission is expected to shift its regulatory gears to focus more intently on ways to boost capital formation more broadly. critics have said the sec has in the past neglected this mission, as the number of initial public offerings have fallen while the number of regulatory requirements placed on companies has increased. wall street deal making attorney jay clayton, who was nominated by president donald trump to serve as chairman of the sec, is expected to make capital formation a centerpiece of his tenure. he is still awaiting his confirmation hearing before the senate banking committee, and a date has not yet been announced. the bill that warner and toomey plan to unveil, which has been endorsed by the private supermarket chain wegmans, would amend an sec rule that governs how private companies give stock options and other equity awards to their employees.   the rule exempts private companies from being required to register their securities with the sec   a lengthy and expensive undertaking. however, in order to qualify for the exemption, companies must meet certain conditions. under the rule, if a company collectively grants more than $5 million in stock awards to its employees during a one year period, then certain disclosure requirements are triggered   including the need to produce financial statements that are prepared in accordance with u.s. accounting rules. the $5 million trigger was set in 1988, and has not been updated or pegged to inflation, warner’s spokeswoman said. under the proposed legislation, the threshold would be increased to $10 million before triggering disclosure obligations.  additionally, the amount would be automatically indexed to inflation every five years.          the bill comes at a time when congress is expected to take up legislation to loosen rules believed to stifle economic growth. this committee is expected to play a crucial role in helping craft such legislation.         ",0

" the white house on sunday defended president donald trump’s decision to invite philippine president rodrigo duterte to washington, saying his cooperation was needed to counter north korea, even as the administration faced human rights criticism for its overture to manila. trump issued the invitation on saturday night in what the white house said was a “very friendly” phone conversation with duterte, who is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the philippines. “there is nothing right now facing this country and facing the region that is a bigger threat than what’s happening in north korea,”  white house chief of staff reince priebus told abc’s “this week” during a weekend in which trump sought to firm up support in southeast asia to help rein in north korea’s nuclear and missile programs. north korea suggested on monday it would continue its nuclear weapons tests, saying it will bolster its force “to the maximum” in a “consecutive and successive way at any moment” in the face of what it calls u.s. aggression and hysteria. priebus insisted the outreach to duterte “doesn’t mean that human rights don’t matter, but what it does mean is that the issues facing us developing out of north korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row.” since he came to power last year, duterte has often sniped at washington, his country’s longtime ally, has sought to mend relations with china and spoken of improving ties with russia. asked on monday about his invitation from trump, he was non committal, telling reporters: “i’m tied up. “i cannot make any definite promise. i am supposed to go to russia and go to israel,” he said, referring to already scheduled visits. foreign ministry spokesman robespierre bolivar said that once a formal letter of invitation came it would be accepted.  the  invitation for duterte to the visit white house at an unspecified date appeared to be the latest example of the affinity trump has shown for some foreign leaders with shaky human rights or autocratic reputations. for instance, he expressed admiration for russian president vladimir putin during the 2016 presidential campaign, hosted egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi at the white house and has had warm words for chinese president xi jinping, whom trump is pressing to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor, north korea. on sunday, trump also extended a white house invitation to thai prime minister prayuth chan ocha, a former general who heads a military government that took power in a 2014 coup. prayuth’s administration had strained relations with trump’s predecessor, barack obama. “celebrating a man who boasts of killing his own citizens and inviting him to the white house, while remaining silent on his disgusting human rights record, sends a terrifying message,” said john sifton, the asia director of human rights watch. “by effectively endorsing duterte’s murderous ‘war on drugs’, trump has made himself morally complicit in future killings,” he said. a trump administration official insisted, however, that the invitation was not a reward to duterte or an endorsement of his policies but a decision that engagement with the philippines was better than withdrawal which could “intensify bad behavior” by duterte. “it’s not a ‘thank you’,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “it’s a meeting.” the official denied a new york times report citing administration officials saying the state department and the national security council were caught off guard by the invitation to duterte and were expected to object internally. “we were not surprised. the guys who prepared for the call were unified on this,” the official said. priebus made clear that north korea was the top priority. “if we don’t have all of our folks together — whether they’re good folks, bad folks, people we wish would do better in their country, doesn’t matter, we’ve got to be on the same page” on north korea, priebus said. but taking a swipe at trump for his invitation to duterte,  democratic u.s. senator chris murphy tweeted: “we are watching in real time as the american human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash.” thousands of filipinos have been killed since duterte unleashed his fierce anti drugs campaign nearly 10 months ago. police say they have killed only in self defense, and the deaths of other drug dealers and users was down to vigilantes or narcotics gangs silencing potential witnesses. human rights groups say official accounts are implausible and accuse duterte of backing campaign of systematic extrajudicial killings by police. the government denies that. duterte was infuriated by the obama administration’s expressions of concern about extrajudicial killings after he took office last year and threatened to sever the long standing u.s. defense alliance. duterte spoke positively about trump, a fellow populist, after the u.s. presidential election in november, and the new administration has sought ways to mend the alliance. in a summary of saturday’s phone call between the two leaders, the white house said the two discussed “the fact that the philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.” the white house statement included no criticism of duterte’s methods.

" uganda s parliament abruptly adjourned a debate on tuesday over extending president yoweri museveni s decades in power after a lawmaker said soldiers had entered the building and members of parliament scuffled with police.  there were so many (soldiers), i saw them. they were in the chaplaincy,  legislator gaffa mbwatekamwa, among several in museveni s ruling party who oppose extending his rule, told a local television station. scuffles broke out between lawmakers and police shortly after speaker rebecca kadaga adjourned the debate, just moments starting it early on tuesday. it was unclear what triggered the confrontation. television footage showed chaotic scenes of lawmakers and police both trying to address the cameras. the incident followed a similar disruption to a debate on the issue in september. the army did not immediately reply to a request for comment. police spokesman emilian kayima said they had no immediate comment but would issue a statement later. lawmakers were debating a draft bill that would remove a constitutional age cap that bars museveni from standing again.  the constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate to 75, making 73 year old museveni ineligible to stand at the next election in 2021. museveni has ruled for 31 years but public anger is mounting over corruption, rights violations and poor social services.  the opposition, church leaders, and even some members of the ruling party oppose the amendment. police have put down protests against it using teargas, beatings, detentions and live bullets. at least two people have been killed. a previous attempt to debate the bill in september ended with lawmakers trading punches and throwing chairs and the forcible intervention of security forces. several legislators were hospitalized with injuries. mbwatekamwa said he recognized some members of the military in parliament from the fracas in september.  some are in civilian clothes, some of the soldiers are the ones who manhandled us the other time,  he said.  proceedings resumed about two hours after they were suspended and stretched on for about seven hours before kadaga adjourned them again to wednesday, when a final vote on the bill is expected. the latest attempt to debate the law started on monday with the presentation of a report by a house committee. the speaker suspended six legislators opposed to the measure on monday for disorderly conduct.  both police and military have been deployed around parliament this week. lawmakers say the heavy security is designed to intimidate them, but police say it is to prevent protests. the military usually does not comment on political matters. several african leaders have amended laws designed to limit their tenure. such moves have fueled violence in countries including burundi, democratic republic of congo and south sudan.

" suspected boko haram suicide bombers have killed at least 13 other people in an attack on a market in the northeast nigerian town of biu in borno state, officials said on saturday. the blasts struck while aid workers were distributing food to people affected by the eight year conflict with boko haram, said aliyu idrisa, a community leader. in addition to the 13 victims, 53 people were injured and two bombers were killed, said victor isuku, police spokesman for borno state. saturday s attack bore the hallmarks of boko haram, which uses suicide bombers, often women and girls, to attack crowded public spaces.  last week, a suicide bombing at a mosque in the northeastern town of mubi killed at least 50 people, one of the deadliest attacks in recent years. the government has said its long term plan for the northeast is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns and effectively cede the countryside to boko haram. that plan and a string of deadly attacks have raised questions about assertions by the nigerian government and military that boko haram s islamist insurgency has been all but wiped out.

" united auto workers president dennis williams said on tuesday that democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton has assured him she would renegotiate the north american free trade agreement if she is elected president. williams’ comments come as clinton is under pressure on international trade deals from republican presidential nominee donald trump and supporters of her former democratic rival bernie sanders. clinton has previously said she wanted to rework nafta. her campaign on tuesday declined to comment on the meeting with williams. williams said he met with clinton one on one prior to the union’s endorsement of her in may, when sanders was still in the race to be the democratic party’s nominee. the uaw has more than 400,000 members.  “she’s committed to me that not only would (she) dig into nafta but she made every indication that she would sit down and try to redo nafta,” williams told reporters during a telephone press conference from philadelphia, where he is attending the democratic national convention. williams said clinton “recognizes that nafta was not the success that it was supposed to be,” when her husband, bill clinton, pushed for it as president two decades ago. stephen miller, senior policy adviser to the trump campaign, said hillary clinton “will never renegotiate bill clinton’s nafta.” the trump campaign adviser said, “you can be certain when she was personally getting paid millions and millions by wall street and big banks to deliver secret speeches she wasn’t breathing a word against globalist trade pacts.”  nafta, which eliminated most tariffs on trade between the united states, mexico and canada, was promoted as a way to support economic growth by eliminating barriers to trade. opponents say it has robbed americans of jobs because it makes it easy for u.s. companies to move operations to mexico where wages are much lower.   williams said he hopes that an updated treaty would help foster stronger worker unions in mexico, where many auto manufacturers have factories. “she told us all that,” afl cio president richard trumka said in an interview, referring to clinton’s assurances to labor unions that she would rework nafta. the afl cio, a federation of unions which includes the uaw,  stayed neutral during the democratic primary but endorsed clinton in june once it was clear she would become the party’s nominee. the uaw endorsed clinton in may. williams said that support among uaw members for a trump presidency has fallen to about 19 percent from 28 percent last year, before trump said that new automotive industry jobs could be placed in states without strong union support at lower wages than those earned by uaw members.

" top aides to president donald trump on monday predicted the house of representatives would move this week to overhaul the u.s. healthcare system, though republicans remained divided on how to protect sick americans from insurance price hikes. the white house is eager to move forward on legislation to repeal and replace the affordable care act, commonly called obamacare, to make good on a key campaign promise. republicans tried but failed to pass a replacement bill in march in an embarrassing setback for the trump administration. lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow states to opt out of obamacare protections for people with pre existing medical conditions   provisions that force insurers to charge sick people and healthy people the same rates. it was unclear when or if a vote would be scheduled. trump told fox news channel that he would not set a deadline for the vote, and indicated he was open to improvements. “we’re either going to have a great plan or i’m not signing it,” he said in the interview. in a separate interview with bloomberg news, trump insisted that the new bill would maintain protections for pre existing conditions. “i want it to be good for sick people. it’s not in its final form right now,” he told bloomberg. “it will be every bit as good on pre existing conditions as obamacare.” ten major patient advocacy groups said they opposed the reworked healthcare bill, including the american heart association and american diabetes association. other major medical groups such as the american medical association have also expressed concerns over coverage losses and unaffordable insurance for those with pre existing conditions. republican lawmakers have struggled to unite around legislation, with moderates and conservatives within the caucus divided over key provisions. once a plan passes the republican controlled house, it is expected to face a tough fight in the senate, where republicans have a narrower majority and where some party senators have expressed misgivings about the house bill. white house chief of staff reince priebus and white house economic adviser gary cohn on monday said in separate interviews with cbs’ “this morning” that they thought there were enough votes to pass the bill this week. house republican leaders were more cautious. as of monday afternoon, no vote had been scheduled and backers of the healthcare proposal had not released legislative language. representative cathy mcmorris rodgers, chair of the house republican conference, said republican members needed time to understand new tweaks to the bill. “we are having those member to members conversations right now,” mcmorris rodgers told fox news. vice president mike pence made his way to capitol hill late on monday to make the case to members who are on the fence, a republican aide said on condition of anonymity, noting leaders are believed to be within five or six votes of having enough support to pass the bill. the freedom caucus, which brought down the previous effort to pass a healthcare bill, has endorsed the new measure. the republican aide told reuters all but one or two members of the group will support the reworked plan. “this bill doesn’t get all the way there but it’s a good step and is ... the best we can get out of the house right now,” representative jim jordan, chairman of the group, told cnn. but several moderate republicans were either undecided or opposed the bill for fear that it would not protect those with pre existing conditions and cause millions to lose health insurance. representative charlie dent, a moderate republican from pennsylvania, said he still had problems with the latest plan and suspected there were not enough votes to pass it. “too many americans are going to be without coverage,” dent told msnbc, adding that the plan could make things even worse for vulnerable americans.

" the u.n. torture investigator voiced concern on wednesday at calls by some republican candidates in the u.s. presidential race to authorize water boarding in interrogating detainees, noting that it was illegal under domestic and international law. republican candidate donald trump softened his stance on torture last friday, saying he would not order the u.s. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. the night before, he indicated he might order u.s. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. trump’s rival and number two in the republican primaries, senator ted cruz of texas, said last month he would only allow limited use of the practice. he said he didn’t believe waterboarding met the international definition for torture. “candidates in the united states have again discussed whether waterboarding is torture or not and have actually promised to bring it back and to bring even harsher techniques,” juan mendez, u.n. special rappporteur on torture, told a news briefing in geneva. the bush administration allowed the use of waterboarding   the practice of pouring water over a cloth covering a detainee’s face to mimic the sensation of drowning   around conflicts in iraq and afghanistan. president barack obama banned it days after taking office in 2009. “the bush administration itself had withdrawn the torture memos when it was discovered that these things were happening as a matter of policy,” mendez said. “even the republican administration had already recognized that these things are illegal.” “they are illegal as a matter of international law, they are illegal as a matter of constitutional law in the united states, they are illegal as a matter of military law...and they are immoral anyway,” he said. speaking as a u.s. citizen, rather than in his u.n. role, he said: “yes, i think the damage in the standing of the united states as a law abiding nation and as an example to other states to fight crime and terrorism within the strictures of the rule of law is very seriously damaged by this kind of rhetoric.” the senate intelligence committee released a report in 2014, despite the objection of republicans, that detailed what it called torture tactics used by the central intelligence agency, including extensive use of waterboarding.

" the obama administration’s top supreme court lawyer is leaving office at the end of june having won a string of major cases including fending off challenges to president barack obama’s signature healthcare law and legalizing same sex marriage. solicitor general donald verrilli has served in the justice department post since june 2011. he also held two other positions in the obama administration. verrilli’s deputy, ian gershengorn will take over, the justice department said in a release announcing verrilli’s departure. “for five years, solicitor general don verrilli has fought in our nation’s highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved america forward,” obama said in a statement. verrilli twice successfully defended the 2010 affordable care act, known as obamacare, against conservative challenges. in 2012, the court ruled 5 4 to uphold the law against a broad legal attack. three years later, the justices rejected a second challenge on a 6 3 vote. “thanks to his efforts, 20 million more americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care,” obama said. in other major victories, verrilli urged the justices to strike down the federal defense of marriage act, which barred the recognition of same sex marriages for the purposes of federal benefits. the 5 4 ruling striking down the law in june 2015 helped pave the way for the court’s 5 4 landmark 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, which verrilli also advocated for.  in another case, verrilli successfully persuaded the court in 2012 to strike down provisions of a harsh anti immigrant law in arizona on a 5 3 vote. “through these and many other cases – and through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy – don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all americans and moving our country forward,” attorney general loretta lynch said in a statement. setbacks included the court’s 2013 ruling on a 5 4 vote striking down a key provision of the voting rights act, a law enacted to protect minority voters. he also lost a case 9 0 in which a company challenged obama’s authority to appoint members of the national labor relations board when the senate was in recess. the court has yet to rule in several major cases verrilli argued this year, including a challenge to a restrictive texas abortion law and his defense of obama’s executive action that would protect more than four million immigrants from deportation.

" malaysia has asked interpol to try to locate a malaysian financier for questioning over his suspected involvement in a multi billion dollar scandal at state fund 1malaysia development berhad (1mdb), the deputy prime minister said on monday. the u.s. justice department is seeking to seize $1.7 billion in assets that it said were bought with misappropriated funds from 1mdb, according to dozens of civil lawsuits filed by the department in the past two years.  the assets include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in new york, and a $107 million interest in emi music publishing bought by low taek jho, also known as jho low, the lawsuits said.  low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has not been charged with any crime. but u.s. authorities have said they are pursuing a criminal probe into 1mdb linked transactions.      we are confident interpol will act professionally, but the police have yet to receive any detailed information (on low s whereabouts),  deputy prime minister ahmad zahid hamidi said in parliament. a spokesman for low could not be reached for comment. low has previously denied any wrongdoing, saying that the u.s. justice department s actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case . interpol did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  1mdb, founded by prime minister najib razak, is facing money laundering probes in at least six countries including the united states, switzerland and singapore. a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1mdb by high level officials of the fund and their associates, according to the u.s. lawsuits.  low is accused in the lawsuits of using 1mdb linked funds to buy hollywood actor leonardo dicaprio a $3.2 million picasso painting, and giving about $9 million in jewelry to australian model miranda kerr. dicaprio and kerr have turned over the items to u.s. authorities and promised to cooperate in the 1mdb probe. the lawsuits also said $681 million from 1mdb was transferred to the account of  malaysian official 1 , which u.s. and malaysian sources have previously identified as najib. najib has denied any wrongdoing and a malaysian government investigation has also cleared him of any wrongdoing. a malaysian police probe into 1mdb is under way.

" the u.s. supreme court on monday faulted north carolina again in a racially tinged voting rights case, upholding a lower court’s ruling that republican lawmakers mapped state legislative districts in a way that diluted the clout of black voters. but the justices also threw out another ruling by the same panel of three federal judges ordering special elections by november to fill the state legislature seats at issue in the dispute. the high court, with no recorded dissents, sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider whether special elections are necessary. the supreme court in january put the matter of special elections on hold while it decided whether to hear the state’s appeal of the ruling. the justices upheld an august 2016 ruling by the three judge panel that the districts were racial “gerrymanders,” with boundaries drawn to diminish the voting power of minorities, and violated the u.s. constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law. the lower court found that the republican led state legislature had crammed black voters into a limited number of districts in order to lessen their statewide electoral power. at issue were nine state senate districts and 19 state house districts, as carved out in a plan adopted by the legislature in 2011. the supreme court has dealt with north carolina voting rights cases three times in the past three weeks. on may 22, it ruled that north carolina republicans unlawfully took race into consideration when drawing two majority black u.s. house of representatives districts, concentrating black voters in an improper bid to diminish their statewide influence. on may 15, the justices rebuffed a republican bid to revive a strict north carolina voter identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters. on monday, the justices, in an opinion with no recorded dissents throwing out the decision requiring special elections, said the lower court gave only a “cursory” analysis of whether such elections were “a proper remedy for a racial gerrymander” when it ordered them last november. they added that said “obvious considerations include the severity and nature of the particular constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty.” packing minorities into a limited number of legislative districts would reduce their influence in electing a larger number of lawmakers, increasing the sway of white voters. “whether the election is november 2018 or earlier, redrawing the districts is good for our democracy by leveling the playing field for free and fair elections,” north carolina governor roy cooper, a democrat, said in a statement. “the people should be able to choose their representatives in competitive districts instead of the representatives being able to choose the people in lopsided, partisan districts,” cooper added. republican lawmakers praised the high court’s action to throw out the order requiring special elections. “we are encouraged the supreme court unanimously rejected the lower court’s politically motivated attempt to force a special legislative election in 2017 and its efforts to ‘suspend provisions of the north carolina constitution,’ ignore voters’ constitutional right to elect representatives to two year terms, and effectively nullify their votes from 2016,” state senator ralph hise and representative david lewis said in a statement. democrats have accused republicans of taking a variety of steps at the state level to disenfranchise black and other minority voters who tend to back democratic candidates. republicans have defended their actions, saying some are meant to prevent voter fraud.

" danish police said on tuesday the size of a headless female torso found on the sea s edge in copenhagen suggested it could be that of a swedish journalist who died after taking a submarine ride with the vessel s danish inventor. police said divers were still searching the area and they were investigating reports of other body parts that may have been spotted in copenhagen harbor. danish inventor peter madsen has been charged with killing kim wall, a swedish journalist, in his home made submarine.   we re dealing with a torso where arms, legs and head were cut off deliberately. the length of the torso doesn t speak against it being kim wall, but we still don t know,  copenhagen police spokesman jens moller said in a video statement. madsen told a court she had died in an accident on board the submarine and that he had buried her at sea, changing his earlier statement that he dropped her off alive in copenhagen. police are conducting dna tests to identify the torso   found on monday by a passing cyclist   and the results are due wednesday morning, moller said. the bizarre case has dominated danish and swedish media, and drawn interest from around the world. madsen has been charged with the manslaughter of wall, who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17 metre (56 feet) submarine on aug. 10. he denies the charge. he was rescued a day later after his uc3 nautilus sank in the narrow strait between denmark and sweden. police found nobody else in the wreck. madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, went before a judge on saturday for preliminary questioning. the case is closed to the public in order to protect further investigations, police said.

"the defense department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or ufos, at the urging of then-democratic senate majority leader harry reid, according to new reports.both the new york times and the website politico published stories saturday revealing the existence of the pentagon s now-defunct advanced aerospace threat identification program.the new york times said the ufo program began in 2007, while politico reported in began in 2009.according to the reports, reid, a nevada democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.a pentagon spokesman said the ufo program ended in 2012, though the new york times said the defense department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. the advanced aviation threat identification program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  pentagon spokeswoman dana white told politico.  it was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the dod to make a change. white added:  the dod takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former hawaii democratic sen. daniel inouye and former alaska sen. ted stevens, who have both since died.both outlets said reid s interest in ufos was the result of friend, and donor bob bigelow, who owns bigelow aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and ufos have visited earth.the new york times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. i m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry i got this thing going,  reid told the newspaper.  i think it s one of the good things i did in my congressional service. i ve done something that no one has done before. both outlets said the person who ran the program, luis elizondo, resigned in october and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   fox news",1

" thousands of rohingya muslims fleeing violence in myanmar are trying to cross the border with bangladesh, bangladeshi security officials said on saturday, as fresh fighting erupted in myanmar s northwestern rakhine state.  the death toll from widespread attacks staged by rohingya insurgents on friday has climbed to 96, including nearly 80 insurgents and 12 members of the security forces, the government said, prompting it to evacuate staff and villagers from some areas. the attacks marked a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since last october, when a similar offensive prompted a major military sweep beset by allegations of serious human rights abuses. the treatment of approximately 1.1 million muslim rohingya in mainly buddhist myanmar has emerged as the biggest challenge for national leader aung san suu kyi, who late on friday condemned the morning raids   in which insurgents wielding guns, sticks and homemade bombs assaulted 30 police stations and an army base. the nobel peace prize laureate has been accused by some western critics of not speaking out for the long persecuted muslim minority, and of defending the army s counteroffensive after the october attacks. some 3,000 rohingya arrived at the naf river separating myanmar and bangladesh on saturday, manzurul hassan khan, a bangladeshi border guard commander, told reuters.  about 500 rohingya, mostly women and children, spent the last night in a marshy area waiting to cross over,  said khan.  we protected them the whole night. today they went back.  reuters reporters saw hundreds of rohingya crossing into bangladesh near the border village of gumdhum as gun shots could be heard from the myanmar side. they could be seen squatting in a marshy area, hiding in the bushes from border guards.  we managed to escape the shooting in myanmar and tried to enter bangladesh. we waited all night after we were pushed backed by bangladesh border guards last night. this morning, we managed to enter somehow,  said hamid hossain, 42, who crossed into bangladesh on saturday with a group of three families. a 25 year old man whose relatives said he had been shot by myanmar security forces on friday died as he was carried to bangladesh for treatment. he was buried near a refugee camp close to the border on saturday, according to camp resident mohammed shafi, who said he witnessed the burial. bangladesh s foreign ministry on saturday said it was concerned that thousands of  unarmed myanmar nationals  had assembled near the border to enter the country.  rohingya have been fleeing myanmar to bangladesh since the early 1990s and there are now around 400,000 in the country, where they are a source of tension between the two nations who both regard them as the other country s citizens.  in myanmar, the government said there had been several large clashes involving hundreds of rohingya across northwestern rakhine on saturday. the fiercest fighting took place on the outskirts of the major town of maungdaw, near the alodaw pyae buddhist monastery. maungdaw resident nay myo lin, 27, told reuters by telephone that security forces opened fire on scores of what appeared to be muslim men with guns near the monastery.  police shot at them to break up the group and then the men shot back in the direction of the entrance gate of the city,  said nay myo lin.  as the fighting went on throughout the day, i was stuck in the monastery and didn t dare to go out. when the sound of gunshots stopped, i ran to my house,  he said. fearful rakhine buddhist residents in maungdaw town gathered in homes while men stood guard by the windows, said ohmar lin, a female resident of the town.  we don t go out of the house, but i am ready to fight   we are prepared with knives and sticks to protect ourselves if they come here,  she said. the united nations security team has sent an internal update to staff about the clashes, seen by reuters, saying that myanmar government officials had assured the u.n.  about their readiness to provide troops to secure our compounds if it becomes necessary . the government said in a statement that:  extremist bengali terrorists are attacking using man made mines ... swords, sticks, guns. they also killed islamic religious people of their own faith who were village administrators.  the term  bengali  is seen as derogatory by many rohingya as it implies they are illegal immigrants from bangladesh, although many can trace family in myanmar for generations. the myanmar army operation last year was heavily criticised internationally amid reports of civilian killings, rape and arson that a united nations investigation said probably constituted crimes against humanity. suu kyi is blocking the u.n. mandated probe into the allegations. aid workers and monitors worry that the latest attacks, across a wider area than october s violence, will spark an even more aggressive army response and trigger communal clashes between muslims and buddhist ethnic rakhines. nearly 200 people were killed and around 140,000 displaced in communal violence in the state in 2012. in a statement late on friday, suu kyi  strongly condemned   brutal attacks by terrorists on security forces in rakhine state .  i would like to commend the members of the police and security forces who have acted with great courage in the face of many challenges,  she added. the government said it had evacuated officials, teachers and hundreds of villagers to army bases and main police stations.  some will be evacuated by helicopters and some will be taken out by the security forces,  a military source based in rakhine told reuters. the arakan rohingya salvation army (arsa) which instigated the october attacks claimed responsibility for the offensive, presenting it as a defence against the myanmar army. myanmar declared arsa, previously known as harakah al yaqin,  a terrorist organisation in the wake of the attacks.

" israel shot down a syrian spy drone over the golan heights on saturday, the israeli military said. the drone was downed with a patriot interceptor missile over the golan demilitarized zone that has separated israeli and syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war. the military initially told reuters the uav was russian manufactured but offered no evidence. a military source later said it was unclear whether the uav was indeed russian made.   it was a reconnaissance uav (unmanned aerial vehicle) and not an attack uav and we are checking whether there is any connection to iran and hezbollah,  military spokesman, lieutenant colonel jonathan conricus, told reuters.  israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman said israel viewed the incident gravely and would respond to any provocation.   we hold the syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,  lieberman said in a statement. russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of syrian president bashar al assad in 2015, joining a de facto alliance with iranian forces, lebanese hezbollah and other shi ite muslim militias helping damascus beat back islamic state and other sunni muslim insurgent groups. israel fears an eventual assad victory could leave iran with a permanent garrison in syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring lebanon by the iranian backed hezbollah and has been lobbying russia and the united states for reassurances that iranian and hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within syria.   we will not allow the shi ite axis to establish syria as its forefront base,  lieberman said. the golan, which israel captured from syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the syrian civil war. israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross border attacks and has struck suspected hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in syria during the civil war. for its part, russia has set up a military hotline to prevent warplanes or anti aircraft units clashing accidentally over syria.

" ukraine s eu membership ambitions will collide with the west s reform demands at a summit on friday with eu leaders ready to admonish kiev for failing to implement anti corruption laws that would bring it closer to the west, officials say. european union leaders gathering in brussels for the biennial  eastern partnership  summit with ukraine and five other former soviet republics are worried kiev has lost interest in the reforms it began with zeal after its pro european uprising in 2014. at stake for kiev is new funding to rebuild the corruption ridden economy, including a possible donors  conference, more eu  financial sector aid and a lithuanian led push for 10 year development fund.  we have to show some tough love because friendly advice isn t working  said a senior eu official preparing the summit with ukraine, georgia, moldova, azerbaijan, armenia and belarus.  ukraine is the highest profile test of the eu s 15 year old policy to build an outer ring of market democracies from the caucasus to the sahara without offering eu membership. backed by washington, the strategy has so far worked by rewarding president petro poroshenko with attention, visa free travel for ukrainians and a free trade deal with the eu.  but ukraine remains perceived as one of the world s most corrupt countries, according to transparency international, ranked 131 out of 176 countries in 2016.  olena halushka of the non governmental anti corruption action centre in kiev said the political elite was now trying to  fake  the reforms agreed with western donors, including energy, judicial and police overhauls.   we are also witnessing attempts to roll back the achievements,  she said of poroshenko s reforms since 2014. eu leaders are expected to  acknowledge the european aspirations  of ukraine, georgia and moldova in a summit statement   eu code for closer ties but not membership. kiev wants a promise of eu membership. washington and brussels say ukraine would do well to follow the reformist minded baltic countries, now eu members, who as outsiders in the 1990s were told they had little chance of joining the bloc.  ukraine is at risk of taking our aid for granted,  said a second eu official involved in policymaking with kiev.  poroshenko, whose country is battling with a russian backed insurgency in eastern ukraine, says the country has implemented more reforms in the past three years than in all of the last 24. but lately, the message from poroshenko s government is to back off in the run up to the 2019 presidential elections, which will be the focus now, eu officials and diplomats say.  a year ago, things were looking promising, but now vested interests are fighting back,  said a third eu official.  we can t plough more money into ukraine on that basis.  there are achievements, including a revamped police force, a wealth declarations database for officials and modernization of the banking sector and state owned energy firm naftogaz.  but some proposed laws, such as to legalize agricultural land sales and set up an independent anti corruption court, have been pushed back, while some existing reforms are under threat.  the wealth declarations register, launched in october 2016, is ineffective because authorities have not introduced software that would cross reference data and identify malfeasance. slow progress on the anti corruption court and backtracking on gas pricing commitments have also stalled funding under ukraine s $17.5 billion imf program. accusations that ukrainian officials have tried to undermine anti corruption investigators are a concern, eu officials said. with no threats other than withholding aid, the eu has few new incentives, having granted visa free travel and market access to ukraine.    we definitely need to look for new carrots, which would be linked to reforms,  said activist halushka.

" oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, u.s. president elect donald trump’s choice to lead the environmental protection agency, said on wednesday he will review the obama administration’s recent decision to lock in fuel efficiency rules. on friday, outgoing epa administrator gina mccarthy finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by president barack obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration’s climate legacy. “it merits review and i would review that,” pruitt said during a contentious senate confirmation hearing, questioning the decision of mccarthy to finalize the determination just two weeks after the public comment period closed on dec. 30.  pruitt said separately he would not commit to allowing california to continue its own clean vehicle rules under a 2009 decision by the obama administration. major u.s. and foreign automakers have appealed to trump, who has been critical of obama’s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. as part of a 2012 regulation, epa had to decide by april 2018 whether to modify the 2022 2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. in 2011, obama announced an agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. this, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.     the epa said in july that because americans were buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. in november, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. mccarthy said her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rested on an extensive technical record. she said the rules are “feasible, practical and appropriate” and in “the best interests of the auto industry.” senator james inhofe, an oklahoma republican, on wednesday said mccarthy’s determination was an “extreme action” that “broke the deal” with automakers. legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the trump administration and congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the obama administration during its final months in office. the 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the epa under trump would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing it and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if that step was taken. separately. california’s new democrat senator kamala harris asked pruitt whether he would commit to upholding the california waiver. pruitt did not say outright that he would uphold the waiver, which allows california to pursue its own emission standards that are more stringent than the federal rules.

" u.s. president donald trump will sign an executive order on tuesday to undo a slew of obama era climate change regulations, a move meant to bolster domestic energy production but which environmentalists have vowed to challenge in court. the decree, dubbed the “energy independence” order, will seek to undo former president barack obama’s clean power plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants   a critical element in helping the united states meet its commitments to a global climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in paris in december 2015.  it will also rescind a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, reverse rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production, and reduce the weight of climate change in federal agencies’ assessments of new regulations. “we’re going to go in a different direction,” a senior white house official told reporters ahead of tuesday’s order. “the previous administration devalued workers with their policies. we can protect the environment while providing people with work.” trump will sign the order at the epa with the agency’s administrator scott pruitt, interior secretary ryan zinke and energy secretary rick perry on tuesday afternoon.  the wide ranging order is the boldest yet in trump’s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency. “i cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create but i can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,” kentucky coal association president tyler white told reuters. environmental groups have promised to challenge the orders. “these actions are an assault on american values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every american,” said billionaire environmental activist tom steyer, the head of activist group nextgen climate.  green group earthjustice said it will fight the order both in and out of court. “this order ignores the law and scientific reality,” said the group’s president trip van noppen.  trump campaigned on a promise to sweep aside green regulations he said hurt the economy, and vowed to pull the united states out of the paris climate accord. since being elected, however, he has been mum on the paris deal and the executive order does not address it. the white house official said trump’s administration was discussing its approach to the accord, meant to limit the planet’s warming by reducing carbon emissions. the order will direct the epa to start a formal “review” process to undo the clean power plan, which was introduced by obama in 2014 but has never been implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by republican states.  the review is likely to trigger legal challenges by environmental groups and some state attorneys general that could last years. the clean power plan would have required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

" an armed alliance involved in a three week battle over the libyan smuggling hub of sabratha said on saturday it had taken over protection of the mellitah oil and gas terminal after expelling a rival group. an organization called the operations room and its allies have been fighting the anas al dabbashi brigade, a major facilitator of migrant smuggling that recently said it had changed tack and struck a deal with the u.n. backed government in tripoli to stop boats setting off across the mediterranean. the fighting killed 17 and wounded 164, omar abduljaleel, commander of the operations room, told reporters in sabratha, a town west of the capital tripoli. the dabbashi brigade had been guarding the facility west of sabratha since 2015. it is run jointly by libya s national oil corporation (noc) and italian firm eni. the setback for the dabbashi brigade creates new uncertainty over the control of migrant flows from libya.       since a 2016 deal between the eu and turkey to block crossings in the aegean, libya has been the gateway for the vast majority of migrants trying to reach europe by boat, and the area around sabratha has been the most common departure point. from july, the number of crossings dropped sharply, a change attributed to increased activity by libya s eu trained coastguard and to the dabbashi brigade blocking departures in return for offers of amnesty and jobs in the security forces. asked whether the operations room would stop illegal migration, abduljaleel said:  god willing we will work on illegal migration after the biggest smuggler has been eliminated.  the dabbashi brigade has confirmed the retreat from sabratha, where the operations room took reporters on a tour. several houses in the main street had been hit by rockets or were burned out but otherwise the city was calm. both the dabbashi brigade and the operations room, which was created last year to force islamic state from sabratha, have links to the u.n. backed government of national accord (gna). italian officials have visited sabratha as part of efforts to block migrant flows from there.

" opponents of the cuban government are putting forward an unprecedented number of candidates for municipal elections in late october, the first step in a process to select a new president after nearly 60 years of the castro brothers  rule. the electoral cycle comes at a tricky time for the caribbean nation as the castros  revolutionary generation dies off, an economic reform program appears stalled, aid from key ally venezuela shrinks, and the trump administration threatens. the municipal vote, the only part of the electoral process with direct participation by ordinary cubans, is expected to attract 35,000 candidates for the island s 168 municipal assemblies. it will be followed by provincial and national assembly elections in which candidates are selected from slates by commissions. the new national assembly will in late february select a successor to president raul castro, 86, who has announced he will step aside after two terms. raul, younger brother and successor to fidel castro who died in november, will retain a grip on power as head of the communist party, the only legal party in cuba. the elections are being cast in state run media as a show of support for the castros  1959 revolution rather than an opportunity to debate the pressing issues. campaigning is prohibited and candidates for the 12,515 ward delegate positions are nominated at neighborhood meetings based on their personal merits, not policy positions. they need not belong to the communist party and many candidates are independents but only few government opponents have ever competed. during the last election, the three dissidents nominated lost at the polls.  this year, however, one coalition of opposition groups, otro18 (other18), says it is running more than 160 candidates in the municipal elections, demanding electoral reform and government transparency.  this is unheard of,  said boris gonzalez, 41, one of the aspiring otro18 candidates, explaining they wanted to challenge the communist party from within the system. otro18 spokesman manuel cuesta morua said in an interview that its candidates had faced harassment and threats by state security forces for months and had been warned not to participate. the government has not responded to these accusations.    the communist party says it does not intervene in the elections, but a video circulating on social media of first vice president miguel diaz canel, raul castro s probable successor, suggested otherwise.  there are six initiatives for the 2018 elections that seek to propose counter revolutionaries as candidates,  diaz canel told communist party cadres in the video.  we are taking steps to discredit all that.   in this battle, which we are already fighting, we are going to be involved in this whole process in the second half of the year,  he said. the government has not commented on the video. cuba brands all dissenters as mercenaries funded by foreign governments and exiles, out to topple the government. even if a few dissident candidates beat the odds and are elected to municipal assemblies, they have little chance of getting any further. the candidates for the provincial and national assemblies are nominated by commissions composed of representatives of communist party controlled organizations such as the trade union federation and committees in defense of the revolution. the slates have had the same number of names as seats in previous elections. up to 50 percent of those names must be ward delegates. after the general election, the assemblies elect their respective executives and on feb. 24 the new national assembly is scheduled to name a new president and other members of the council of state.  i have never voted for anyone important, not even our president,  said retired air force mechanic and staunch castro supporter eduardo, who requested his last name not be used.  i can only vote for my neighborhood representative and they never go anywhere,  he said,  but i still think it s a better system than one based on money and lies.

" the leader of lebanon s hezbollah said on monday his iran backed group had not sent any weapons to yemen and denied that it was behind the firing of a ballistic missile at riyadh from yemeni territory held by tehran allied houthi forces.      in a televised address, sayyed hassan nasrallah also urged followers to listen to recent comments by israeli officials which he said pointed to ties between saudi arabia and israel, hezbollah s arch foe. an israeli cabinet minister said this week that israel has had covert contacts with riyadh amid common concerns over iran, a first disclosure by a senior official from either country of long rumoured secret dealings. nasrallah also heaped criticism on arab states that accused hezbollah of terrorism at an emergency arab league meeting on sunday. he called the charge  trivial and ridiculous , asking why arab states were silent about what he described as the destructive war a saudi led coalition has waged in yemen.  i confirm to them, no ballistic missiles, no advanced weapons, and no guns ... we did not send weapons to yemen,  or bahrain, or kuwait, or iraq, he said.  hezbollah had however sent arms to palestinian territories, including anti tank missiles, nasrallah said.  i take pride in that. and in syria there are the weapons we are fighting with,  he said.  regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between sunni muslim monarchy saudi arabia and shi ite iran, whose rivalry has wrought upheaval in syria, iraq, yemen and bahrain.      arab league foreign ministers held an emergency meeting on sunday at the request of saudi arabia to discuss ways to confront iran and hezbollah over their role in the region.  saudi arabia has accused the heavily armed shi ite hezbollah of helping houthi rebels in yemen and playing a role in the ballistic missile attack this month. riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against the houthis in yemen in 2015.   i categorically deny it,  nasrallah said.  no man from lebanese hezbollah had any part in the firing of this missile or any missiles fired previously.   lebanon was thrust back to the forefront of the power struggle between riyadh and tehran after its prime minister quit abruptly in a broadcast from saudi arabia this month. in his shock resignation speech, saad al hariri accused iran and hezbollah of  sowing strife  in the region.  lebanese state officials and politicians close to hariri say he was held in riyadh against his will and forced to resign, which riyadh and hariri denied. lebanese president michel aoun has refused to accept the resignation until hariri comes home. a long time saudi ally and sunni leader, hariri flew to france at the weekend and is expected to return to beirut in time for independence day celebrations on wednesday.  we are all waiting for the return of the prime minister, whom we still consider has not resigned,  nasrallah said.  when he comes, we will see. we are open to any dialogue and any discussion that happens in the country.  hariri took office last year in a power sharing deal that saw aoun, a hezbollah political ally, become president. his coalition government includes hezbollah, a military and political movement that wields great influence in lebanon.     hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to syria to support the damascus government against mostly sunni syrian rebel factions, some of whom have received saudi aid, and islamic state militants. nasrallah also thanked major general qassem soleimani for what he described as his huge role in fighting islamic state in the eastern syrian town of albu kamal. soleimani, commander of foreign operations for iran s revolutionary guards, led the battle from the frontlines from the very beginning, he said.   the battle must continue with the same strength ... and we must continue working to end the remnants of daesh,  he said, using the arabic acronym for islamic state. hezbollah could withdraw its large number of commanders from iraq once islamic state was defeated there, he said.

" u.s. house speaker paul ryan on wednesday left the door open on whether republicans’ tax overhaul would increase the nation’s deficit or follow republicans’ long standing principle that the cost of any legislation be offset by government spending cuts. asked if their tax plan would be revenue neutral, ryan told the associated press in an interview: “we want pro growth tax reform that will get the economy growing, that will get people back to work, that will give middle class taxpayers a tax cut, and that will put american businesses on a better competitive playing field... that is more important than anything else.”  ",0
" the united states suggested on tuesday it could cut u.s. aid to pakistan or downgrade islamabad’s status as a major non nato ally to pressure the south asian nation to do more to help it with the war in afghanistan. a day after president donald trump committed to an open ended conflict in afghanistan and singled out pakistan for harboring afghan taliban insurgents and other militants, u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said washington’s relationship with pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism. “we are going to be conditioning our support for pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,” tillerson told reporters.  u.s. officials are frustrated by what they see as pakistan’s reluctance to act against groups such as the afghan taliban and the haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring afghanistan. pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting u.s. and afghan government forces in afghanistan. tillerson said the united states could consider withdrawing pakistan’s status as a major non nato ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u.s. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve. “we have some leverage that’s been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non nato alliance partner   all of that can be put on the table,” he said. in a televised speech on monday offering few specifics, trump promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u.s. backed afghan government and he singled out pakistan for harboring militants. u.s. backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban’s hard line islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden, architect of the sept. 11 attacks on new york and washington that year.  u.s. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents. about 2,400 u.s. troops have died there in america’s longest military conflict.   (for a graphic on u.s. troops and contractors in afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6cxq)  the afghan government welcomed trump’s speech, but the taliban said it would make the country a “graveyard for the american empire.”     successive u.s. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan, which has a porous border with afghanistan. washington fumes about inaction against the taliban, but pakistan has cooperated on other u.s. counterterrorism efforts, including against al qaeda and islamic state militants. the pakistani foreign ministry said it was “disappointing that the us policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the pakistani nation” in fighting terrorism.  “as a matter of policy, pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,” it said.      a senior u.s. official said on tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. trump also called for pakistan’s great rival india to play a bigger role in afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for pakistan’s generals.     “trump’s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,” said zahid hussain, a pakistani security analyst. the united states has little choice but to use pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan, giving islamabad considerable leverage. u.s. officials fret that if pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize afghanistan and endanger u.s. soldiers.     defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the u.s. military’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, general joseph dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to afghanistan. “when he brings that to me, i will determine how many more we need to send in,” mattis told reporters in baghdad. “it may or may not be the number that is bandied about.” u.s. officials have said trump has given mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in afghanistan. the u.s. air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following trump’s decision, its top general told reuters on tuesday. most u.s. troops in afghanistan work with a nato led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al qaeda and islamic state fighters.

" republicans are seizing on the fbi’s revived scrutiny of hillary clinton’s handling of government emails, hoping it will hurt not just her presidential hopes but democrats’ chances of regaining one or both chambers of congress in next week’s election. republican lawmakers are threatening to investigate clinton from her first day in office if the democrat is elected president on nov. 8, following the fbi’s move to review newly discovered emails that might pertain to a previously completed investigation into clinton’s use of a private server while she was secretary of state. after fbi director james comey’s announcement last friday of the latest review, which indicated no wrongdoing on clinton’s part, republican presidential candidate donald trump and other republicans have hammered clinton as scandal prone, seeking to renew questions about her integrity. a clinton presidency would bog down in “scandal baggage,” u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on tuesday, adding he was focused on defending republican majorities in congress in the election. “this is what life with the clintons looks like. it’s always a scandal one after another, then there’s an investigation,” ryan, the most senior elected republican in the country, told fox news in an interview. “you never know what’s coming next.” saying that clinton would take office “with her scandal baggage,” ryan added: “i don’t think that’s what the american people want to see.” clinton has said she is confident the fbi will not find anything problematic and will reach the same conclusion it did in july when it found no grounds for charges from her use of a private email server. opinion polls show clinton maintaining her lead over trump, although her advantage has narrowed slightly since early last week. the effect of comey’s news on voters’ support is not yet clear.  the university of virginia’s center for politics said this week that several key states, including arizona, florida and ohio, were now considered “toss up,” having earlier been classified as leaning democratic, saying the races had been tightening regardless of any “comey effect.”  “if comey’s decision results in republicans holding onto the senate and losing fewer house seats because he has invigorated their ‘checks and balances’ argument, we will also attribute this to the comey effect,” the center’s larry sabato and his colleagues wrote. graphic: race to the white house tmsnrt.rs/298mtyd ryan maintained the arms length posture toward trump that he adopted after a 2005 video emerged last month in which the new york businessman was heard boasting about groping women. the wisconsin republican said he voted for trump in early voting last week, but that his position had not changed and that he had no plans to campaign with his party’s nominee, instead focusing on maintaining republicans’ control of the house.  “my focus personally right now is saving our house majority. i’m going to indiana, michigan, new york and virginia today to fight for house republicans,” ryan told fox. while republicans appear poised to keep control of the house, the race for the senate remains evenly matched, according to an average of polls by realclearpolitics. some conservative members of the republican caucus in the house, unhappy with ryan’s treatment of trump and his handling of other issues on capitol hill, have questioned whether he should continue as speaker after the election. “we’re all focused on beating democrats on nov. 8. all the rest of this stuff will sort itself out,” ryan told fox news. “i’m very confident where i stand with our members.” republican u.s. senator john cornyn called on tuesday for attorney general loretta lynch, a barack obama appointee, to intervene over the clinton email probe. “ag lynch has authority to unravel clinton email mess by appointing a special counsel who can convene an impartial grand jury,” cornyn wrote on twitter.  such a move would all but guarantee that controversy over clinton’s emails would simmer into 2017 and perhaps beyond, potentially tying up her agenda if she were elected to the white house. some republican senators have already also vowed to block any hearing on clinton’s potential supreme court justice nominees to fill the court’s current vacancy. republican house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz told the washington post last week he had years’ worth of potential material that could be used to investigate clinton. california republican darrell issa, a house judiciary committee member, told fox business network late on monday: “i suspect there will be more hearings” following the latest email probe.

" iranian president hassan rouhani said on tuesday that saudi arabia presents iran as an enemy because it wants to cover up its defeats in the region.   saudi arabia was unsuccessful in qatar, was unsuccessful in iraq, in syria and recently in lebanon. in all of these areas, they were unsuccessful,  rouhani said in the interview live on state television.  so they want to cover up their defeats.  the sunni muslim kingdom of saudi arabia and shi ite iran back rival sides in the wars and political crises throughout the region.  saudi arabia s crown prince called the supreme leader of iran, ayatollah ali khamenei,  the new hitler of the middle east  in an interview with the new york times published last week, escalating the war of words between the arch rivals. tensions soared this month when lebanon s saudi allied prime minister saad hariri resigned in a television broadcast from riyadh, citing the influence of iran backed hezbollah in lebanon and risks to his life. hezbollah called the move an act of war engineered by saudi authorities, an accusation they denied.  hariri returned to lebanon last week and suspended his resignation but has continued his criticism of hezbollah. iran, iraq, syria and russia form a line of resistance in the region that has worked toward stability and achieved  big accomplishments , rouhani said in the interview, which was reviewing his first 100 days in office in his second term. separately, rouhani defended his government s response to an earthquake in western iran two weeks ago, a major challenges for his administration. the magnitude 7.3 quake, iran s worst in more than a decade, killed at least 530 people and injured thousands. the government s response has become a lightning rod for rouhani s hard line rivals, who have said the government did not respond adequately or quickly to the disaster. supreme leader khamenei, the highest authority in iran, has also criticized the government response. hard line media outlets have highlighted the role played by the islamic revolutionary guards corps, the most powerful military body in iran and an economic powerhouse worth billions of dollars, in helping victims of the earthquake. government ministries have provided health care for victims and temporary housing has been sent to the earthquake zone, but problems still exist, rouhani said in the interview.

" president donald trump has given the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in iraq and syria that critics said allowed the white house to micro manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscured the real number of u.s. forces. the pentagon, which confirmed the move on wednesday, said no change has yet been made to u.s. troop limits. it also stressed the u.s. strategy in iraq and syria still was focused on backing local forces to fight islamic state   a tactic that has averted the need for a major u.s. ground force. but the shift on troop limits was another sign of the greater authority trump appears comfortable giving his military commanders to make battlefield decisions and could allow for more rapid increases in troop levels in the future. the force management level system was introduced in iraq and syria during barack obama’s administration as a way to exert control over the military. obama periodically raised fml limits to allow more troops in iraq and syria as the campaign against islamic state advanced. but the numbers did not reflect the extent of the u.s. commitment on the ground since commanders found often less than ideal ways to work around the limits   sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors. the force management levels, which are officially at 5,262 in iraq and 503 in syria, are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of u.s. forces in both countries. pentagon spokeswoman dana white said trump delegated authority to defense secretary jim mattis to determine force management levels for iraq and syria going forward. “we want our reporting to congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood,” white said in a statement, which was reported earlier on wednesday by buzzfeed news. “we will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground. this is about transparency.” proponents within the u.s. military of changing the system also argue that bringing that decision making authority to the pentagon from the white house will allow more flexibility in responding to unforeseen developments on the battlefield. replacing the force management level system with something more transparent could be a tricky task, not least because of political sensitivities about u.s. forces in iraq. influential shi’ite cleric moqtada al sadr already has called on iraq’s government to order the withdrawal of u.s. and allied forces after the battle to retake the city of mosul from islamic state is complete. the iraqi and u.s. governments, however, have signaled the need for a continued u.s. military presence. how large that would be has yet to be determined. too much information about the comings and goings of u.s. troops, particularly if announced in advance, could give information to enemy, experts say.

" at first glance, u.s. representative mo brooks seems exactly the kind of candidate president donald trump would love to see win tuesday’s republican primary election for alabama’s open u.s. senate seat. the 63 year old republican is a freedom caucus member and an immigration hardliner who calls opponent luther strange “lying luther,” echoing trump’s penchant for bestowing insulting nicknames on his political foes. strange, 64, is the former state attorney general who was appointed to fill the senate seat left vacant after jeff sessions became u.s. attorney general. “trump would like to drain the swamp; brooks would like to blow it up,” said larry powell, a professor of communication at the university of alabama at birmingham. “but their goals are the same.” yet it was strange, not brooks, who earned a coveted prize last week in a race that could measure trump’s influence in a state he carried easily in last year’s election, despite recent indications that his support among republicans may be softening.  trump took to twitter to offer strange his “complete and total endorsement.” the tweet came as something of a surprise. known as “big luther” thanks to his 6 foot 9 inch (2.1 meter) frame, strange has a close alliance with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who is under fire from trump for failing to push his agenda through congress and refusing to eliminate a filibuster that gives democrats veto power over many key bills. strange agrees the filibuster should remain in place.     in a telephone interview, brooks noted that trump followed his endorsement of strange with a barrage of twitter criticisms aimed at mcconnell, which brooks called “extraordinarily baffling.” “any alabama voter who wants to see president trump’s legislative agenda pass the united states senate would be much better served to vote for mo brooks than luther strange,” brooks said. “president trump’s entire legislative agenda is dead so long as the senate’s 60 percent rule requires president trump to get the consent of democrat leader chuck schumer to pass it.”     both brooks and strange may be losing to the third viable candidate in the nine way race. former alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore, 70, has led in several voter surveys, though polling in the race has been limited. the moore and strange campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. assuming no candidate reaches 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers will go head to head in late september, with the winner a heavy favorite against whoever emerges from the democratic primary. for weeks, strange and brooks have lobbed attacks at one another as insufficiently committed to trump. advertisements from supporters of strange highlighted brooks’ endorsement of texas senator ted cruz for president last year, as well as criticism brooks made of trump at the time. brooks, a founder of the house of representatives’ far right freedom caucus who survived the shooting attack on congress members at a softball practice in june, has fired back by attacking strange for his close ties to senate leadership. strange and brooks have largely ignored moore, though strange backers have run some anti moore ads in recent days. “i think both assume that moore is going to make the runoff, and whoever gets to the runoff will likely beat him,” powell said.     moore made his name in 2003 by refusing a federal court order to remove a ten commandments monument from the state supreme court building and losing his position. after winning another term in 2013, he was suspended in 2016 and later resigned after directing state judges to defy the u.s. supreme court and continue to enforce a ban on same sex marriage. the former judge is popular among religious conservatives but had trouble expanding his base in previous campaigns for governor. each contender would likely serve as a reliable republican vote in the senate, with little daylight between their policy positions. “all three of these candidates are different intensities of the same flavor,” said steven taylor, a political science professor at troy university in alabama.

" ireland does not need an election now that talks on the terms of britain s exit from the european union are entering a crucial phase on how to avoid a physical border between ireland and northern ireland, irish foreign minister simon coveney said on friday. the irish government was on the verge of collapse on thursday after the party whose votes prime minister leo varadkar depends on to pass legislation said it would seek to remove the deputy prime minister in a breach of their cooperation agreement.  ireland does not need an election right now. there is no reason why frances fitzgerald should be forced to resign. the issues that are under discussion are under investigation by a tribunal we all agreed to set up,  coveney said.  the main opposition party... are risking an election at a time when there are some really, really serious issues for the government to manage in the national interests,  he said referring to brexit negotiations.

" bahrain s top shi ite muslim cleric underwent surgery on friday, activists said, after he was hospitalized following months under virtual house arrest. news of ayatollah isa qassim s fragile health has stoked tension in bahrain as the sunni muslim led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority shi ites.  the leading shia cleric was transferred this morning at 7:30 am to ibn al nafees hospital to undergo urgent surgery,  the london based bahrain institute for rights and democracy (bird) said in a statement.  upon his arrival, he went into surgery and he is expecting further operations.  qassim, who is believed to be in his 70s, was suffering constant pain and excreting blood, citing a groin hernia, diabetes and a form of heart disease, the group said on nov 27. the interior ministry said in june 2016 that qassim s citizenship had been revoked, accusing him of trying to divide bahraini society, encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the gulf arab state. the decision sparked angry protests in bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional shi ite power iran and statements of concern from the united states and britain. in may, five people were killed when security forces raided qassim s homevillage to disperse followers. the sunni ruled kingdom   where the u.s. fifth fleet is based   has pursued a crackdown on members of the shi ite community since, with saudi help, it quashed 2011  arab spring  protests calling for more rights and representation. authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents  passports and arrested suspected militants accused of being backed by its arch foe, shi ite iran.

" one evening last june, some of the republican party’s wealthiest donors gathered for a cocktail party at an exclusive resort in deer valley, utah, during a three day retreat hosted by former massachusetts governor mitt romney.      they had just heard from six presidential hopefuls. tom duncan, the ceo of tool maker positec tool corp, chatted with a few attendees about a fantasy ticket to secure the white house in november 2016: wisconsin governor scott walker, with senator marco rubio of florida as his running mate. duncan, for his part, liked ohio governor john kasich, but also had his eye on former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina. no one mentioned donald trump, even though he had been signaling for months that he planned to run. four days later, the new york property magnate declared his candidacy and within weeks had shot to the top of the polls, eclipsing all of his republican rivals. the story of trump’s rise has played out day after day on television and on social media, but the conversations behind closed doors among members of the republican elite during this period have been less well documented. many of the conversations had one thing in common: a stubborn refusal to take trump seriously, even as fans packed sports stadiums to see him in the summer months, as he dominated media coverage of the election, and as polls showed him winning wide support among young and old, men and women.   scenes like the one at deer valley would be repeated in rarified enclaves of the party elite around the country again and again in the coming months. many in the republican establishment believed he would eventually self destruct or that americans would lose patience with his bombast, his free wheeling insults and lack of firm policies to back up his promises to “make america great again.” they were wrong. trump won a majority of the states holding nominating contests on super tuesday, accelerating his march to the republican nomination.  republican donors, strategists and campaign operatives interviewed by reuters admitted they had misjudged the mood of voters who have thrown their support behind trump after he promised to build a wall on the mexican border, temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states and block syrian refugees because they might be militants.  trump’s spokeswoman, hope hicks, declined to comment for this story. trump’s rise seemed to take place entirely outside the structures of the normal nomination process within the republican party. for example, many attending the conservative political action conference, a gathering of grassroots activists, in february 2015, were excited by presidential hopefuls wisconsin governor walker and texas senator ted cruz. the annual convention is a must stop for any republican white house contender. in his speech, trump tried out a now familiar pledge: build a giant southern wall to stop illegal immigrants, a vow that would later ignite his insurgent campaign and propel him well ahead of the main pack of republican presidential hopefuls.  “his speech was well received, but he didn’t do that well in the straw poll,” said matt schlapp, the chairman of the american conservative union, which organizes cpac each year. kentucky senator rand paul won the poll. cpac’s attendees were mostly conservative political activists already engaged in the electoral process. the fans who would drive trump’s success were not. the candidates favored at cpac have languished. walker left the race just two months after officially entering it. paul dropped out after the first nominating contest in february. cruz has won just three of more than a dozen contests so far. early in his run, trump was a source of puzzlement for rich republicans, such as those who gathered one sunday in early august in the hamptons, new york’s gilded summer retreat destination, to discuss the 2016 race. they met for lunch at a billionaire hedge fund manager’s estate near a body of water nicknamed “goldman pond” for the concentration of financiers’ houses around it. among the guests were former defense department officials, the chief executive of a big real estate firm, a prominent private equity partner and conservative academics, according to one of the guests, who spoke on condition of anonymity. the source, like many other guests, backed former florida governor jeb bush.  “a variety of subjects were discussed, but chief among them, i would say, was the concern and consternation over the candidacy of donald trump,” the source said. at the time, trump’s rating in national polls was twice his closet rival’s, according to reuters/ipsos data.  the attendees discussed trump’s rise and observed he had struck a chord with many americans, the source said. they fretted over whether his presence would force other candidates to go negative. they hoped he wouldn’t hijack the first republican presidential debate, then less than a week away. but they decided, however it had begun, trump’s reign atop the polls wouldn’t last. “i think it’s literally just a matter of time before his nascar careens into the wall – and hopefully not into the other drivers,” the source said in an interview on aug. 6. trump has not crashed. and on monday, the ceo of nascar, brian france, endorsed him. right to rise, the outside spending group backing bush, built up a massive war chest of more than $100 million to attack opponents who could thwart his bid for the nomination. trump was not identified as a potential threat, not in the summer, nor in the fall of 2015, even as he eclipsed bush, according to multiple interviews during that period with a member of the group’s leadership team. “i don’t think he’s hurting us,” the official, who did not want to be identified, said in an interview last fall. trump would be a footnote in the race by january or february 2016, he predicted.  bush bowed out on feb. 21 after months of struggles were capped by a poor showing in the south carolina primary. duncan, the positec ceo, said conversations he had with representatives from three campaigns as recently as november and december barely touched on trump.  “there was so much time left,” he said. “i honestly thought that he would implode.”  now there is little time left, and the party’s establishment can only look back at early warning signs they missed. one came in january 2015 at the iowa freedom summit, a republican “cattle call” for white house hopefuls that marked the unofficial start of the 2016 presidential race. attendance spiked after organizers added trump to the agenda.  “when we announced donald trump, the event took on a life of its own,” said david bossie, the president of the conservative advocacy group citizens united and the conference’s organizer. “i don’t believe it’s possible, if you were not in a coma, for anyone in the establishment, or the media, or on planet earth, to have missed donald trump’s ascendancy to be the leading

" the swiss government urged voters on monday to keep the annual license fee that finances public broadcasters, saying taxpayer money played a crucial role in supporting cultural diversity and political discourse in the media. its call seeks to defuse support for the  no billag  initiative that comes to a binding vote on march 4 and which opinion polls show has around 57 percent support. proponents want to scrap the  billag  fee that last year raised 1.37 billion swiss francs ($1.38 billion) as the financial lifeblood for public broadcasters at the federal, regional and local levels. national broadcaster srg, which operates in the four national languages, gets 75 percent of its budget from the fee.  a varied media offering is important for a small, polyglot country like switzerland with its direct democracy,  president doris leuthard said in a statement. switzerland says it would be the first country in europe to abolish fees for public broadcasting should the measure be adopted. this would push advertising revenue to mostly foreign controlled commercial media. the government is cutting the fee   levied on homes with a radio or tv set   to 365 francs per private household from 2019 from around 450 now. businesses will pay up to 35,590 francs a year based on a sliding scale of annual sales.

" the united states on monday described as “troubling” an israeli bill supported by a ministerial committee allowing settlers in the occupied west bank to remain in homes built on private palestinian land and said it hoped the law does not pass.  “we are deeply concerned about the advancement of legislation that would allow for the legalization of illegal israeli outposts located on private palestinian land,” state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau told a briefing. if the law were enacted it could pave the way for the legalization of dozens of illegal outposts deep in the west bank, she said, adding: “this would represent an unprecedented and troubling step that’s inconsistent with prior israeli legal opinion and also break longstanding policy of not building on private palestinian land,” trudeau said. the u.s. believes settlements endangered prospects for a two state solution and israeli palestinian peace, she said. “we hope it doesn’t become law,” trudeau added. the ministerial committee defied prime minister benjamin netanyahu and voted on sunday to back the bill, which will be debated by parliament on wednesday and is still some distance from becoming law. israel’s attorney general, avihai mandelblit, has called the bill legally flawed in its current form, saying that it contravened private property rights legislation and did not tally with israel’s international law commitments.

" when the u.s. supreme court on monday takes up a challenge brought by texas and other states to president barack obama’s executive action on immigration, the eight justices face a series of legal questions beginning with whether texas and the other state challengers even have grounds to bring the case.  obama’s november 2014 orders affect immigrants in the country illegally whose children are u.s. citizens or lawful permanent residents or who themselves have been in the united states since they were children.  here is a look at some of the key legal questions in the case:  legal standing to bring a case, challengers must first demonstrate that they have legal “standing,” arising from some injury or negative consequences. in this case, that means the states need to show that they would be hurt by the obama administration’s deferral of deportation for immigrant parents and children with deep ties to the united states but who are in the country illegally.  the state of texas has taken the lead in the lawsuit against the obama administration to block the president’s actions. texas asserts that it has standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants with new authorization to live in the united states.  texas subsidizes the cost of processing driver’s licenses and contends obama’s actions would cost it millions of dollars. the obama administration rejects that basis for standing to file suit, asserting that any such costs are “incidental” and could be avoided by the state. obama administration lawyers say texas could eliminate the subsidies for these driver’s licenses and eliminate the harm claimed by the state.  if a majority of the justices finds that texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue, the case of united states v. texas ends there and the obama administration wins.  rule making requirements if the justices agree that texas has standing to bring the case, they then would consider whether deferred deportation policies that were part of obama’s actions violated rule making requirements in a federal law called the administrative procedure act. under that law, federal agencies typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested parties a chance to comment.  obama administration lawyers say the deferred deportation practices are not binding rules subject to the administrative procedure act. rather, they characterize these policies as an outgrowth of the u.s. department of homeland security’s discretion in determining deportation priorities.  the administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his department's limited resources on deporting serious criminals and securing the border.  ’take care’ a final possible question for the justices is whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the u.s. constitution that presidents must “take care” to “faithfully execute” the nation’s laws.  texas and the other states that brought the lawsuit say obama, in taking executive action that bypassed congress, crossed that line because congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant.  the obama administration says it was faithfully executing the authority to determine priorities under immigration law.

" six farmers were shot dead in the peruvian amazon by a group of masked men in an apparent dispute over land rights, a police officer and a tribal leader said on thursday. five bodies, one with hands and feet bound, had been thrown in a river and a sixth was found by the side of an unpaved road in the jungle region ucayali, police officer raul huari said. the victims were part of a community of peasant farmers that had refused to leave the lands they work on when pressured by oil palm growers, said robert guimaraes, the head of an indigenous federation in ucayali. witnesses testified that a group of between 30 and 40 men carrying shotguns tried to kill some 20 farmers altogether, huari said.  they said they showed up, surrounded them and just started shooting. fortunately, some managed to escape,  he said.  in my 24 years of working i ve never seen anything like this.  huari said the murders appeared to be linked to a land dispute, and a special police unit and prosecutors were carrying out investigations. the murders occurred on sept. 1, marking the three year anniversary of the killing of four indigenous activists who had faced threats from loggers in a different part of ucayali. after the 2014 murders, which came as peru was hosting a global environmental summit, the government promised to do more to protect remote amazonian villages that often lack land titles from violent clashes with squatters. guimaraes said native communities continue to face violent threats in ucayali and that no one has been convicted for the 2014 murders. peru s culture and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment. the native shipibo community of santa clara de uchunya, which lives near where the farmers killed, has tried to repel oil palm growers from their lands for years, said guimaraes.

" a beijing court on tuesday sentenced the architect of the $9 billion ezubao online financial scam to life imprisonment, and handed down jail time to 26 others, marking the close to one of the biggest ponzi schemes in modern chinese history. the ruling comes at a time when the government is stepping up efforts to crack down on risky and illicit behavior in the country s financial sector, including the unruly peer to peer industry that continues to attract high volumes. beijing first intermediate people s court sentenced ding ning   chairman of anhui yucheng holdings group that launched ezubao in 2014   to life in prison and fined him 100 million yuan ($15.29 million) for crimes including illegal fundraising, illegal gun possession and smuggling precious metals. ding dian, the chairman s brother, was also sentenced to life, while zhang min, yucheng s president, and 24 others were sentenced to imprisonment for 3 to 15 years, according to an article on the beijing courts social media account. ezubao, once china s biggest p2p lending platform, folded last year after it turned out to be a ponzi scheme that collected 59.8 billion yuan ($9.14 billion) from more than 900,000 investors through savvy marketing. by the time police made arrests in early 2016, the company had failed to repay 38 billion yuan. the incident sparked a crackdown on the freewheeling online financial services market and led to new regulations to control china s p2p industry   where monthly volumes are above $50 billion, statistics published by industry portal p2p001 show. ezubao s excesses also became a cautionary tale following its collapse. ding collected a monthly salary of 1 million yuan, and admitted on state television to spending an estimated 1.5 billion yuan in ezubao funds on himself.  we fabricated projects to raise money,  ding said, according to a xinhua report published last year, and then used fabricated project companies to re circulate cash back into accounts linked to his companies. ding also asked dozens of his secretaries to dress only in chanel, gucci and other luxury branded clothing to make the company appear highly successful.  he told zhang, the group president, to buy up everything from every louis vuitton and herm s store in china.

" european union leaders will agree this week to start preparing internally for talks with britain on a post brexit transition, according to a new draft summit statement that spells out conditions which london must meet before negotiations start. the draft [l8n1mr56r], seen by reuters on monday, was circulated by summit chair donald tusk to the 27 other member governments for discussion by ministers on tuesday, ahead of a summit with british prime minister theresa may on thursday and friday. following objections from heavyweight powers germany and france to a first draft last week, the text somewhat hardens up the requirement that london meet conditions set by the eu and softens any suggestion that it is a foregone conclusion that leaders will agree to launch trade talks in december. however, it retains an instruction for eu officials to  start internal preparatory discussions  on how the eu would negotiate a transition and future trade relationship. that, officials say, could save weeks of delay if a december summit does indeed give a green light to a second phase of talks.

" the united states on thursday said it welcomed an announcement by a saudi led coalition to keep the hodeidah port in yemen open for a month and allow humanitarian aid to flow through, and condemned a houthi bombing of a palace in saudi arabia. in a brief statement, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders suggested the united states believed iran bore ultimate responsibility for the dec. 19 missile attack against the palace in riyadh.  we urge the united nations security council to hold iran responsible for its repeated and blatant violations of security council resolutions,  sanders said. at a briefing later on thursday, deputy assistant secretary of state tim lenderking said the united states would have a conversation with saudi arabia about the 30 days the port will be open and about possibly changing the timeline, but said the united states first wants to see ships moving in and goods and services reaching the people of yemen. the saudi led arab coalition fighting in yemen said on wednesday it would open the houthi controlled port it had blockaded. a cholera epidemic has been spreading across the country and 8 million people are on the brink of famine in what the united nations deems the world s worst humanitarian crisis. the saudis say the red sea port is also a hub used by the houthis to bring in weapons, which it accuses iran of supplying. tehran denies the charges. lenderking also said there was no military solution to the conflict and that president donald trump s administration believes the best course is  aggressive diplomacy.  trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted on thursday in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital. when asked if u.s. aid to yemen would diminish given that yemen drafted the resolution and was one of the 120 countries that voted for it, lenderking said he was not sure but trump s threat was not empty.

" the united states drew a hard line for renegotiating the north american free trade agreement on wednesday, demanding major concessions aimed at slashing trade deficits with mexico and canada and boosting u.s. content for autos. at the start of talks in washington, u.s. president donald trump’s top trade adviser, robert lighthizer, said trump was not interested in “a mere tweaking” of the 23 year old pact, which trump has threatened to scrap without major changes. “we feel that nafta has fundamentally failed many, many americans and needs major improvement,” lighthizer, the u.s. trade representative, said at the start of the talks, which reflected trump’s relentless criticism that nafta has caused  massive u.s. manufacturing job losses.  lighthizer put mexico and canada on notice that the united states would use its clout as their biggest export customer to wring concessions, saying the united states wanted substantially tougher rules of origin, including a requirement of “substantial u.s. content” for autos.  he also signaled a fight over nafta’s trade dispute settlement system for changes that would allow more anti dumping duties against canada and mexico, saying this provision should “respect our national sovereignty.” canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland suggested earlier this week that her country could walk away if the united states insisted on scrapping the “chapter 19” trade dispute settlement system that requires the use of binational panels. in her opening statement, freeland took a swipe at the u.s. fixation on cutting its trade deficits, saying: “canada does not view trade surpluses or deficits as a primary measure of whether a trading relationship works. u.s. canada mexico trade has quadrupled since nafta took effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. lighthizer blamed nafta for a direct loss of 700,000 u.s. manufacturing jobs since the pact took effect in 1994, a period that coincides with increasing automation across all industries that has allowed more output with fewer workers. auto industry groups have warned against changing the pact’s rules of origin, which govern how much of a product’s components must originate from nafta countries. they said the pact has allowed them to build a competitive north american supply base that has helped boost exports of u.s. assembled vehicles globally. the pact also has massively boosted u.s. farm income by increasing agricultural exports to both mexico and canada.  “we do not want them to use us as a trading tool and to do harm to the agricultural sector in all three countries,” the president of the american farm bureau federation, zippy duvall, told a news conference on wednesday. corporate chief executives have been sounding “do no harm” warnings on nafta for months.  trump’s relationship with business executives became a high profile issue this week as he disbanded two business advisory councils after several ceos quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence at a rally in virginia on the protesters who opposed white nationalists as well as the white nationalists themselves. canadian and mexican officials at the nafta talks on wednesday declined to weigh in.  asked if there was concern that the political upheaval around trump could impact the nafta talks, mexico’s finance ministry undersecretary, vanessa rubio, said: “these are internal issues of the united states.” freeland refused to be drawn into the u.s. political furor during a news conference before she returned to ottawa.  the first round of nafta talks, which will last until sunday, are expected to focus on consolidating the proposals and demands from all three countries. the long list of u.s. demands could make it difficult for negotiators to reach agreement on modernization plans that also are expected to include new chapters on digital and energy trade, and environmental, labor and currency standards. both freeland and mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo pushed back at the u.s. demands and defended nafta.   guajardo said nafta should be modernized to produce more trade among its participants, not less, and needed more than one winner. “for a deal to be successful, it has to work for all parties involved. otherwise, it is not a deal,” guajardo said. guajardo later told a news conference that it was “too soon” for the three countries to begin narrowing their differences. he said it was not a good idea to add country specific content requirements to the agreement. mexico is keen to maintain preferential access for its goods and services to the united states and canada, where nearly 85 percent of its exports are shipped. its nafta priorities also include greater integration of the continent’s labor markets and energy sectors. weighing heavily over the talks is the 2018 mexico presidential election. mexico has urged all sides to complete the negotiations before the campaign ramps up in february to avoid having them become a political punching bag.

" the chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee said on monday he would block arms sales to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates and other members of the gulf cooperation council pending progress in resolving a simmering dispute with qatar. “all countries in the region need to do more to combat terrorism, but recent disputes among the gcc countries only serve to hurt efforts to fight isis and counter iran,” republican senator bob corker wrote in a letter to secretary of state rex tillerson.  his action could increase pressure on members of the gulf cooperation council to settle the crisis. the gcc groups saudi arabia, kuwait, united arab emirates, qatar, bahrain and oman.  saudi arabia, egypt, bahrain and the united arab emirates imposed a boycott on qatar, their tiny but wealthy neighbor, on june 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism. they have sent it 13 demands including closing al jazeera television, curbing relations with iran, and paying reparations. under u.s. law, major foreign u.s. arms sales are submitted for review to a small group of lawmakers, including the chairman of the foreign relations committee, before they can go ahead. trump considered corker as a potential vice president and secretary of state, and he works closely with the white house. the administration would be unlikely to ignore his resistance to the arms sales, and u.s. officials said they considered his statement part of a broader effort to solve the qatar crisis. a state department official noted that tillerson called on sunday for the countries involved to sit down together and discuss ways forward. the official declined comment on arms sales beyond saying the department remains committed to working with lawmakers. it was not immediately clear what sales would be affected. trump has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in january. he sees weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the united states. a corker aide said his action would not affect sales that had already been reviewed by congress or non lethal assistance, including training. one sale already cleared by congress was for up to $350 billion in precision guided munitions and other offensive weapons to saudi arabia. in his letter, corker said he was pleased with trump’s recent trip to saudi arabia, which included a gcc summit.  “unfortunately, the gcc did not take advantage of the summit and instead chose to devolve into conflict,” corker wrote.

" the new u.s. immigration curbs have cast uncertainty over the futures of thousands of iranian students in the united states, with many losing hope of being able to finish their studies or find a job in the country.   president donald trump’s executive order bans travelers from seven muslim majority countries including iran for three months, and there is little certainty of what will happen after that. many of the students have spent their families’ life savings to pay for an american higher education, which they hope will be a ticket to a well paid job in the west or iran.   now they fear if they leave the country, they will not be allowed back in. they also do not know what status they will have after the three months are up, and whether they will be allowed to study, live or work in the united states.  amin amouhadi, 32, studies at the university of georgia. his girlfriend, who is also iranian, is about to finish her phd in canada. “we were planning to get married in a month and move in together but the current ban and its possible consequences have put the future of all our plans in jeopardy,” he told reuters. “i might quit my phd program, (and) try to find a university in canada to apply for. i can’t think of any other plan.” the united states is the most popular destination for iranians studying abroad, despite decades of hostility between the two countries. the trend goes right to the top; iranian president hassan rouhani’s cabinet boasts more u.s. doctorates than did the cabinet of trump’s predecessor barack obama.   about 8,700 iranian students were at u.s. universities in 2014, a fifth of the estimated 50,000 iranians studying abroad, according to the washington institute for near east policy. more than 3,000 iranian students have received phds from american universities in the past three years, over 7,000 u.s. academics including 40 nobel laureates said in a petition against the order signed by trump on friday. they said the ban could lead to the departure of many talented individuals.  mohammadreza jalaeipour, a post doctorate student at harvard university, has canceled a study visit to oxford university in britain because he was afraid he would not be able to return. the 34 year old said he was not hopeful of extending his studies in another american university or receiving a visa for a job in the united states. “this discriminatory and inhumane order is targeted to harm iranian society. it shows that the u.s. government is dishonest when it says they have no problem with the iranian people and they are only against the iranian government,” he said. medical students could be among the hardest hit. roozbeh esfandiari is an iranian who studied medicine in the united states before gaining a job as a researcher at harris county psychiatric center in houston.  he said u.s. medicine school qualifications could not be easily transferred to other countries, so it would be a major blow for iranian graduates if they were unable to work in the united states after several years of study.   “this news (trump’s order) is a headache for iranian doctors applying for residency,” he said. the educational commission for foreign medical graduates said on its website that it was aware of the executive order and was evaluating the potential impact on international medical students and graduates.   even before trump’s order, the road to american higher education has always been a tough one for iranians. since there is no u.s. embassy in iran, students must travel to embassies or consulates in other countries to apply, which can cost them thousands of dollars. student visas can take many months to secure. because of security concerns, iranians can face background stiff checks. zahra razavi, a computer science student at the university of rochester, said her husband had applied for a u.s. visa several times under the obama administration, with no success. the trump order has crushed their lingering hopes of living together in the united states, she added. “this disaster has caused depression and deep anxiety in me. it’s impossible to continue this way. i have no choice but to say goodbye to my dreams and quit my studies.” shirin sajadi, an iranian psychotherapist in boston, wants to help shell shocked students from her homeland by offering them free psychotherapy sessions.  “there’s a sense of facing crisis and the need to make sense of the chaos surrounding us,” she told reuters.  “many immigrants have come to this country when they had nothing but hope for a better life. they’ve worked hard, played by the rules and hoped to succeed. but now that hope is gone.” ",0

" a vanquished challenger to illinois house speaker michael madigan filed a federal lawsuit on monday against the longtime democratic leader, accusing him of using dirty tactics to beat him in a march primary election. chicago democrat jason gonzales accused madigan of defaming him and crowding the primary with “phony” candidates to dilute his opposition. gonzalez named the 45 year incumbent, the speaker’s political funds, a top aide and his two other opponents, among others, in a 39 count lawsuit over an alleged scheme to swing the four way race in the speaker’s favor.  “madigan won because he engaged in dirty, illegal, fraudulent tactics,” gonzales, who finished second in his bid to topple madigan with 27 percent of the vote, said in a telephone interview. madigan received slightly more than 65 percent. madigan said in a statement that the lawsuit, filed in u.s. district court in chicago, was “without merit.”  “voters of my district soundly re nominated me based on my strong record of service, giving me more than 65 percent of the vote, and they emphatically rejected jason gonzales because they knew he couldn’t be trusted,” said madigan, who is illinois’ longest serving officeholder, representing chicago’s southwest side since 1971. neither grasiela rodriguez nor joe barboza, the two other candidates named in gonzales’ lawsuit, could be reached for comment. gonzales accused madigan of falsely calling him a felon on television commercials and in political mailers based on several arrests and criminal convictions between 1991 and 1994, including the use of stolen credit cards as an 18 year old. gonzales alleged that madigan improperly publicized those criminal records, which should not have been made public after former democratic governor pat quinn granted a pardon and expunged gonzales’ criminal record in january 2015. “madigan’s defamatory statement was one that harmed gonzales’ reputation to the extent it lowered gonzales in the eyes of the community and deterred the community from associating with him,” his lawsuit alleged. “as a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and/or omissions by madigan, gonzales suffered injuries of a personal and pecuniary nature, including emotional distress, damage to reputation and further punishment despite being granted full pardons,” the lawsuit said. gonzales also accused madigan and his aides of diluting the hispanic vote in a legislative district that is about 70 percent latino by planting two opponents with hispanic surnames on the ballot. neither of the candidates, who collectively received nearly 8 percent of the vote, actively campaigned. gonzales’ case is being handled by tony peraica, a former republican member of the cook county board. “i couldn’t find a democratic lawyer who was wiling to take the case,” gonzalez told reuters. “everybody was scared of madigan.” ",0

" president barack obama on thursday said it was time for congress to lay aside politics and to act to provide additional money to combat the zika virus before government funding dries up. “our experts at the cdc, the folks on the front lines have been doing their best in making due by moving funds from other areas, but now the money we need to fight zika is rapidly running out,” obama said at a press conference at the pentagon. he warned that development of a vaccine for the virus could be delayed if congress does not provide any more money and urged americans to contact lawmakers to pressure them to take up the issue. concern over the threat from zika, which can cause a birth defect called microcephaly marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies, has risen since florida authorities last week detected the first signs of local transmission in the continental united states. zika funding remains stalled six months after obama asked the republican led congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds. forty one democratic u.s. senators on thursday sent a letter to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house of representatives speaker paul ryan urging them to summon lawmakers back from their summer recess to vote on emergency funding to fight the virus. but, ryan accused democrats of obstructing the funding and said the obama administration has failed to spend existing funds to prevent the spread of the mosquito borne virus. congress has interrupted its own recesses at least eight times since 1998, most recently in 2013 when lawmakers returned early to debate the use of military force in syria, according to congressional records. the latest round of finger pointing indicated there was little chance lawmakers would cut short their seven week summer break to vote on zika funding. a $1.1 billion compromise failed after house republicans attached language that would place restrictions on abortion and defund part of obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law. senate democrats, who blocked the measure twice before congress left washington last month, want republicans to agree on a new funding measure that drops those provisions, a step republicans reject. “we need the white house and senate democrats to drop politics and put the public’s health first. we hope for a change of heart, and soon,” ryan wrote in an opinion piece in the usa today newspaper. mcconnell spokesman don stewart invited democrats to allow the current bill to pass by unanimous consent at a perfunctory session on friday.

" a housing crisis is spreading in germany, the federal homelessness association said on tuesday, forecasting that 1.2 million people could be living in shelters by 2018. the report came amid heightened concern about germany s rising poverty rate and ability to integrate 1.1 million migrants that have arrived over the past two years, drawn by the country s reputation for affluence, efficiency and stability. the homelessness association said that more than 850,000 people lacked their own accommodation in 2016, up 150 percent from 2014, and half of those affected were migrants.  a total of 52,000 people were living on the streets in 2016, up a third from 2014, the group said in its report. it added that the number of those living in shelters would likely rise by another 40 percent by 2018, driven higher by rising rents, decreasing availability of subsidized housing, and the growing numbers of refugees granted asylum status and therefore entitled to housing. the homelessness association said immigration was a factor behind the rising rate of housing shortage, but also blamed what it called  failed  housing policies.  the main cause of housing shortages and homelessness is a housing policy that has failed in germany for decades, as well as insufficient efforts to fight poverty,  thomas specht, director of the association, said in a statement. almost 20 percent of germany s population, or 16 million people, were at risk of poverty in 2016, the federal statistics office reported last week. germany s labour and social affairs ministry defended its handling of refugee housing needs, noting that finding individual housing around the country remained a challenge.   it should not be forgotten that the swift accommodation of hundreds of thousands of refugees in adequate collective housing in 2015 and 2016 was an extraordinary achievement,  the ministry spokesman said on tuesday. would be partners in a new german government coalition remain at odds over a limit on migration.

" thailand s government on friday announced $2.2 billion in loans and handouts to help stabilize prices for rice farmers, a politically influential group whose heartland is in regions where opposition to the military junta is strongest. thailand s staple food has long been a factor in its politics. the announcement by the commerce ministry came a week after former prime minister yingluck shinawatra fled into exile ahead of a court verdict in a criminal negligence case over a rice subsidy scheme that cost billions of dollars. the ministry said it would provide $1.57 billion in handouts to farmers and $633 million in loans that will cover 3.7 million households. the program will span the seasonal harvest from the start of november this year to the end of february 2018.  this is to help take 2 million tonnes of rice from the market,  nuntawan sakuntanaga, head of the commerce ministry s department of internal trade, told reporters. the government introduced similar short term loans and cash handouts for rice farmers last year that cost the state $2.3 billion to cover 4 million households during the same period.  this subsidy program is essentially similar to past rice subsidies introduced by previous governments,  said somporn isvilanonda, a senior fellow at the knowledge network institute of thailand who is critical of subsidies.  the bottom line is these cash handouts create more debt for farmers,  somporn said. after hitting a four year high earlier this year, the price of benchmark thai 5 percent broken white rice has tumbled by nearly 20 percent over the last two months to $372.50 per tonne, its lowest since april. thailand s main rice growing areas are the northeastern and central regions, which have traditionally been strongholds of support for the populist shinawatra movement of yingluck and her brother thaksin, who was overthrown in a 2006 coup.

"hillary clinton matched president obama s historically low percentage of the jewish vote, driving a third of jews into the republican camp, an unheard of percentage before obama s pro-iran policies. obama also turned jews off by his blatant personal antipathy to israel s prime minister, so the question was whether jews would come back as a voting bloc for clinton, who is thought of as a friend to israel by many jews, merely by association with her husband.the answer is no, jews did not return to the democratic fold.the retired democratic jews of florida were a crucial demographic clinton had to carry, and she didn t, according to lori lowenthal marcus, co-founder of jewschoosetrump.org.experienced political strategist dan rodriguez, founder and ceo of the mgr group, spent the run-up to election day and the big day itself in florida. in the aftermath of the election, he has been traveling to boards of elections in heavily jewish voting districts. he explained that from raw data, jewish votes are difficult to distinguish because they get lumped in with white votes. yet clinton  received only 32 percent of the white votes (into which jewish votes are lumped) in miami-dade [county], whereas obama took 37 percent,  rodriguez told me. in addition, he said,  voters 45 or older, a significant portion of whom are jewish, went strongly for trump, 56 percent to clinton s 42 percent. trump also won the support of passionately pro-israel las vegas casino magnate sheldon adelson, who may have donated more than $75 million to fuel a much needed ad campaign, which ran on all the sports channels and elsewhere in the final two weeks before the election.   american thinker ",1
" two computer technicians declined to answer questions from u.s. lawmakers on tuesday about the unauthorized private email system that democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton used during her tenure as u.s. secretary of state. paul combetta and bill thornton repeatedly invoked their constitutional right not to incriminate themselves during about 10 minutes of questioning while under oath before the house oversight and government reform committee. a third technician, bryan pagliano, declined even to appear, despite a subpoena ordering his testimony. the investigation of clinton’s email system has become a troublesome issue for her presidential campaign, with republican rival donald trump saying a recent finding by federal investigators that she mishandled classified government secrets in her email should disqualify her from office. brian fallon, a clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement it was up to the technicians whether to cooperate, “but we certainly are not prevailing upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry.” clinton has said she regrets using the system in her new york home’s basement for work. voters have said in surveys the decision contributes to a feeling she is untrustworthy. federal bureau of investigation director james comey said in july there was evidence that clinton and her staff may have broken the law with their “extremely careless” handling of classified government secrets, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to prosecute. combetta and thornton work for platte river networks, the denver technology firm that managed clinton’s email servers soon after she left the state department in 2013. they repeatedly invoked their fifth amendment protection from self incrimination to each question from lawmakers. jason chaffetz, the committee’s republican chairman, eventually excused them out of what he called “respect” for their rights. elijah cummings, the committee’s most senior democratic member, expressed sympathy for the technicians, saying the republicans were only trying to use them to embarrass clinton. chaffetz criticized pagliano, who was paid by clinton to manage her server while she was the nation’s top diplomat, for not complying with the subpoena and said the committee would decide after the hearing whether to punish him.  pagliano was given a form of immunity from prosecution in 2015 for cooperating with the fbi as it looked into the mishandling of classified information over the server, but has otherwise cited the fifth amendment in declining to provide information to lawmakers. his attorney did not respond to questions. a fourth witness, justin cooper, testified for more than two hours about his role setting up the email system in 2009 while he worked a clinton family aide. clinton used an at&t email account while a senator and a presidential candidate in 2008. cooper said there was “a desire to change her email address because a number of people had received her email address over the course of those activities.” a summary of the fbi’s findings showed combetta saying he used software called bleachbit to delete an archive of clinton’s work emails around the same time as a conference call with clinton’s lawyers, despite lawmakers seeking the records through a subpoena.

" a financial transaction tax proposed by britain s opposition labour party would risk the competitiveness of london s financial center, the city of london corporation said on sunday, calling for the proposal to be scrapped. the leftist labour party, which is holding its annual conference in southern english town of brighton, has advocated a so called  robin hood  tax to levy charges on bond and derivative trades. it says the tax could raise 4.7 billion pounds ($6.34 billion) to fund higher public spending.  but the city of london corporation, the body which administers policy in the central london financial district, criticized the policy.  a financial transactions tax, however described, would be a unilateral policy which would weaken our hand and undermine our competitiveness,  said the corporation s policy chairman, catherine mcguinness. labour lost a general election in 2017, and one is not scheduled until 2022, but labour is banking on prime minister theresa may s government falling sooner and has briefed financial institutions on its plan in recent months. on the first main day of his party s conference, labour leader jeremy corbyn was asked about his approach to taxation said:  i don t think i m worried about taxing the super rich and the super wealthy.   the objective surely has to be stronger economic base for everybody in this country and dealing with the waste of poverty and inequality,  he told the bbc.

" u.s. president donald trump is open to authorizing additional strikes on syria if its government uses chemical weapons again or deploys barrel bombs in the country, the white house said on monday. “the sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again, we hold open the possibility of future action,” white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters. “if you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb in to innocent people ... you will see a response from this president.” barrel bombs are oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel. trump ordered a cruise missile strike on syria’s shayrat air base last week in response to what his administration and u.s. allies say was a poison gas attack by syria’s military in which scores of civilians, including many children, died. spicer said later his mention of barrel bombs as a potential trigger for further action by the united states did not reflect a change in position. “nothing has changed in our posture,” he said by email. “the president retains the option to act in syria against the assad regime whenever it is in the national interest, as was determined following that government’s use of chemical weapons against its own citizens. and as the president has repeatedly made clear, he will not be telegraphing his military responses.” ",0
" once seen as an opportunity for investors to position themselves for a future north korean turnaround, the country’s rarely traded defaulted debt may move further into the twilight zone after new sanctions were imposed this week on pyongyang. debt from north korea   probably the most isolated of the frontier markets   has already been frozen for years as the secretive nation faces the most stringent sanctions regime in the world.  it is part of a highly opaque market in the legacy debts of countries isolated from the rest of the international community, such as pre castro cuban debt. north korea has syndicated loans with a face value of around $1 billion, tied to loans in default since the 1980s. it has not undertaken any restructuring with its creditors.  the debt was repackaged in 1997 into a special vehicle  called nk debt corporation by french bank bnp, making it into transferable securities.   total debt accumulated by borrowing heavily from western banks back in the 1970s   including principal and accumulated interest   amounted to about $3 billion, washington dc based think tank peterson institute for international economics estimated in 2013.  the securities had been regularly traded since around 2000, according to stuart culverhouse, head of research at exotix capital.  prices spurted higher after the death of president kim jong il in 2011 on hopes that his son kim jong un, north korea’s new swiss educated leader, would make progress with the international community and open up the economy.  that pushed prices to 14 18 cents on the dollar, up from 13 15 but investors’ hopes were soon dashed. culverhouse was unable to say what price the securities could now trade at.   “there was a market, but it essentially got frozen at the beginning of 2013 after the united nations and other sanctions were imposed, which people felt restricted trading in the notes,” he said. exotix, a specialist in emerging and frontier debt, has not seen the loans trade in the past three to four years, culverhouse said. this week’s developments will further dishearten holders of the debt. a war of words between u.s. president donald trump and north korea’s kim has raised fears of a nuclear standoff, while the u.n. security council imposed fresh sanctions on saturday after pyongyang’s intercontinental ballistic missile tests.  these curbs ban north korean exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, and seafood, and could slash the asian state’s $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. “a lot of people have taken a view that it is just not worth it, they won’t trade,” culverhouse said. it is not just the more specialized distressed debt traders who once took a shine to north korean debt: one of the holders of nk debt corporation’s notes is the franklin emerging markets debt opportunities fund. according to the fund’s annual report in july 2016, it held nk debt corporation’s zero coupon bonds with a principal amount of $15.5 million and maturing in march 2020. it did not ascribe a value to the position. but in its july 2013 annual report, the fund had valued the debt, which was denominated in german marks and swiss francs, at $830,000. it said it had acquired the securities between 2007 and 2011 for more than $3.1 million. the asset manager declined to comment. north korea is only the latest frontier market to be moving further out of reach of investors desperate to expand into new high return markets. excitement over investment in cuba for instance has gone tepid after trump ordered a clampdown on u.s. business dealings with the caribbean island’s military, saying he was cancelling his predecessor barack obama’s “terrible and misguided deal” with havana. investing in iran too has proven a long slog, despite optimism after tehran’s 2015 deal with six major powers to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of oil bans and most financial sanctions. “nothing is going to happen with these (north korean) issues for a long, long time,” said charles blitzer, a debt restructuring expert and former imf staffer. blitzer estimates that interest arrears on north korean debt amount to around 4 5 times the outstanding $1 billion principal.   “north korea is like cuba in spades   they have similar ratios of principal to arrears and have not yet indicated much interest in dealing with the london club,” said blitzer, referring to debt owed to the private sector.

" some of his supporters fret that president donald trump is backing himself into a corner with promises that can’t be kept. others lament he is not pulling america from international conflicts as he vowed – or say he should “get off of twitter.”  those grumbles are early warning signs for trump as he marks his 100th day in office on saturday.  they were heard in reuters interviews with trump supporters in “swing” counties that went for democrat barack obama in 2008 and 2012 but then flipped for trump last year – a slice of the electorate dominated by white voters that is crucial to the republican’s re election hopes and that democrats want to win back.  reuters visited the same four places   pinellas county in florida, northampton county in eastern pennsylvania, macomb county outside of detroit, michigan, and gates county in rural north carolina   right after the nov. 8 election.  what reporters found this time in more than two dozen interviews is that trump voters are largely standing with their man but with signs of restlessness, mainly over foreign policy, concerns over getting legislation through congress and some skepticism that he won’t be able to follow through with promises – from building a wall along the mexican border to repealing obama’s signature healthcare law.  but rather than bash trump, many largely blamed democrats and republicans alike, a fractured congress, the federal judiciary, and what they see as a hostile news media.   they showed a willingness to trust the president almost implicitly, saw him as a tireless worker, and appreciated his efforts to secure the border and curb immigration. they had little interest in the in fighting between his senior aides in the white house.  “maybe sometimes i question what’s going on,” said karen mayer, 47, an attorney in clearwater, a west coast florida city in pinellas county, where the majority of its 500,000 voters went for obama in 2008 and 2012 but then flipped for trump last year. he prevailed over democratic challenger hillary clinton by slightly more than 1 percent of the vote there.  “but at the same time, i have faith that he has a strong team,” mayer said.  in a statement touting trump’s record in the first 100 days, the white house highlighted, among other things, his attempts to streamline government by proposing a lean budget, and his aggressiveness in foreign affairs, particularly with regard to challenging russia and iran.  if trump has reason to worry about his re election prospects, it should be because of supporters like brian mccann, 48, who owns a real estate firm in northampton, pennsylvania. “i think he’s finding out that he can’t follow through on all his talk,” he said. “internationally, i think he’s creating more tensions than solutions.”  that was the main reason that holly peseski, 46, a legal assistant in mt. clemens, michigan, graded trump’s tenure as a “b minus” so far. “i don’t like the recent bombings he’s done,” peseski said, referring to u.s. missile strikes on a syrian airfield and a huge bomb dropped on a militant hideout in afghanistan. “he was a little too quick to act.”  peseski had another complaint about trump: “i wish he’d get off of twitter.”      the counties reuters visited reflect the rural, suburban and largely white coalition that carried trump to the white house.  trump was able to flip these counties and dozens more like them powered by an enthusiastic voter base that included many people who had not cast ballots in years, as well as some democrats who crossed over largely because of their dislike of clinton.  an analysis of reuters/ipsos polling data shows slippage in trump's approval ratings, with lower enthusiasm among white men without a college degree, the core of his political base.  in comparing trump’s approval rating in the first 20 days of his tenure to a 20 day period in april, reuters also found a rise in disapproval among independents, college educated adults, people with below average incomes, white women and white millennials.  those women voters were important to trump’s victory. he beat clinton 53 percent to 43 percent among white women, who comprise 37 percent of the electorate. in pinellas county, for instance, white women are by far the largest demographic among its more than 275,000 registered voters. trump beat clinton there by a little more than 5,000 votes.  david jolly, a former republican congressman who lost his pinellas based seat in november in part, he said, because of his criticism of trump, has seen few signs that the president’s support is fading, but at the same time, “he’s not picking up new supporters.”  trump’s overall approval rating in reuters/ipsos polling has declined steadily over the past two weeks and is now at its lowest level since he took office, with 40 percent of americans now approving of his performance in office.  some voters interviewed in the swing counties identified the struggling effort to replace obama’s healthcare law as an early worry about trump.  walter watson, 62, a retired art teacher in gatesville, a town of about 320 people in rural gates county, north carolina, said he did not like the way trump and republicans tried to rush through a new healthcare plan without giving it what he thought was proper consideration.  “you got to be careful, because this is a life and death issue for a lot of people,” watson said.  his sparsely populated county backed obama with 52 percent of the vote in 2012, but trump won it with 53 percent in 2016.  congress is the biggest hindrance to trump’s success, many of those interviewed said.  “i don’t think he’s going to be able to do even half of what he claimed,” said bob white, 71, a retired finance worker in clinton township in michigan. “i don’t think congress is going to go along with him.”  but even as they express skepticism that trump can achieve all of his campaign promises, his supporters are sticking with him for now.  “i think he’s trying,” said watson. “but he probably overstated what he could do, because even a president has limits.”  ",0
" china s highest profile fugitive, exiled billionaire guo wengui, is under attack from a former business partner who claims guo got him framed for crimes he says he did not commit. after having a conviction for embezzling 855 million yuan ($130 million) from a company owned by guo quashed, qu long told reuters he is out for revenge.   when he returns i will sue him in china,  qu said of guo, two days after being released from jail where he served six years of a 15 year sentence.  if he can t return, i will sue him in the united states. as long as he is on the face of this earth, i will find a lawyer and make him pay.  in its ruling last tuesday, the hebei high people s court said there was not enough evidence to support the embezzlement conviction.  qu s interview with reuters was arranged by the chinese authorities, who also provided briefings by three members of a special police taskforce investigating guo, who is living in new york. chinese officials told reuters they wanted to get qu s narrative out through the western media to counteract a barrage of internet postings by guo.  the officials and police involved in the case told reuters that after an investigation that began in 2015 they had discovered that the charges against qu were fabricated by guo and government officials guo had allegedly bribed, including ma jian, the former counter intelligence chief at china s spy agency, the ministry of state security. ma was put under investigation for alleged corruption in 2015 and was expelled from the communist party the following  year. he remains in detention and reuters was unable to reach him for comment. guo did not respond to requests for comment about qu. guo s new york based lawyer, josh schiller, said qu s threat was  further persecution of guo in order to silence his speech . guo, who left china in late 2014 shortly before ma was detained, has previously denied bribing government officials and says accusations leveled against him are politically motivated. the police and other chinese officials who talked to reuters provided no evidence to support their bribery assertions in the  case. reuters was unable to independently confirm whether guo engaged in any wrongdoing. guo is currently living in a $68 million apartment overlooking manhattan from where he has been using social media to make a series of incendiary, though mostly unverifiable, claims of corruption in the top levels of the chinese government. his campaign has been timed for maximum impact ahead of next month s critical congress of the ruling communist party, which is held only once every five years.   the chinese authorities are trying to repatriate guo, who applied for u.s. political asylum earlier this month. in april, at beijing s request, interpol issued a  red notice  seeking guo s arrest on corruption related charges.    the same month, a video confession from ma surfaced online, detailing 10 instances where he claimed he abused his power to benefit guo in exchange for more than 60 million yuan in bribes, including conspiring to detain and frame qu.       guo has said ma s testimony should not be believed, arguing it was likely coerced or made under duress. reuters was unable to independently confirm the events that ma cited. guo and qu were once friends and business partners, having first met two decades ago and, according to qu, bonding quickly over a mutual love of motorcycles and sports cars. the two men fell out over a dispute related to the ownership of tianjin huatai, an investment holding company, with guo claiming qu had reneged on an agreement to hand over control of the company. qu was initially detained on suspicion of possessing firearms and he was eventually sentenced on the embezzlement charges. qu denied any wrongdoing.

" the iowa supreme court has maintained a block on a three day waiting period for women seeking an abortion until a legal challenge concludes, a decision cheered by abortion rights advocates. the provision was signed into law in may by former republican governor terry branstad, part of new regulations that also included a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks. the waiting period portion was challenged earlier this year by the american civil liberties union of iowa and planned parenthood. the iowa state attorney general’s office could not be reached for comment on tuesday. the u.s. supreme court legalized abortion in 1973 although states can limit and regulate abortions. u.s. state legislatures enacted 41 new abortion restrictions in the first half of 2017, according to the guttmacher institute, a reproductive health group that supports abortion rights. planned parenthood on tuesday praised the court’s decision, issued on monday, to keep in place a prior stay on the requirement that women wait 72 hours before having an abortion. “this ruling ensures that women in iowa will have continued access to the health care they need throughout the course of this lawsuit,” said susan allen, a spokeswoman for planned parenthood of the heartland. a lower court had earlier upheld the disputed provision of the law, noting that 27 states have implemented waiting periods for abortion, ranging from 18 to 72 hours, the des moines register reported on tuesday. in may, planned parenthood said it would shutter four of its 12 clinics in iowa as a result of another iowa measure that blocked public money for family planning services to abortion providers.

" u.s. president donald trump and south korean acting president hwang kyo ahn agreed to take steps to strengthen joint defense capabilities to defend against north korea’s nuclear threat, the white house said on sunday after a telephone call between the two leaders. “president trump reiterated our ironclad commitment to defend (south korea), including through the provision of extended deterrence, using the full range of military capabilities,” the white house said in a statement. it also said trump and hwang discussed the upcoming visit by the new u.s. defense secretary to japan and south korea, where shared concerns about north korea will top the agenda. the united states and south korea have agreed to deploy a terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system designed to protect against north korea’s growing nuclear and ballistic capabilities despite objections from china, which says the radar could penetrate chinese territory. north korean leader kim jong un said on jan. 1 his country was close to test launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm), and state media has said a launch could come at any time. north korea has maintained its nuclear and missile programs in violation of repeated rounds of international sanctions.

" democrat hillary clinton plans to pour half of her presidential campaign’s budget into advertising in the first three months of this year as she seeks to fend off an increasingly tough challenge from chief rival bernie sanders, according to a summary of her spending plans reviewed by reuters. the first quarter advertising blitz would represent almost a doubling of the proportion of money that the campaign devoted to such spending, on average, during 2015.  the report, prepared by her team’s finance committee, aims to paint a picture of a fiscally prudent campaign operation that has been spending heavily on digital tools and organizing last year and is now ready to ramp up ad spending as the 2016 white house race moves into a critical new phase. “the significant early resources mobilized by our finance committee in 2015 helped us make smart early investments in key areas – and will enable us to continue with strategic allocations in q1 of 2016,” the report reads. the first quarter is a crucial period in the presidential nominating contest. it kicks off with the iowa caucus on feb. 1, followed by the new hampshire primary on feb. 9 and a series of other early votes through march, including “super tuesday” on march 1 when 11 states hold nominating contests.  many of the contests during march, the report notes, “are in big states with expensive media markets.” in 2015, the campaign devoted nearly 10 percent of its spending to technology and digital tools, about a fifth of the budget on list building and almost another quarter on state organizing, according to the year end document. list building refers to amassing names of potential voters who a campaign wants to woo. the clinton campaign declined to comment on the spending report. the increased focus on advertising spending comes as the campaign expects to shrink the ratios of spending in other areas, especially those that appear related to infrastructure. state organizing, for example, is projected to go from 23 percent in 2015 to 18 percent in the first quarter of this year. list building is expected to go from 21 percent in 2015 to 14 percent in the first three months of 2016. the report comes two weeks before the iowa contest, with clinton locked in a tightening race with sanders, the fiery u.s. senator from vermont who has been drawing big crowds in the early voting states with his calls to crack down on wall street.  the emphasis on fiscal prudence is part of a broader effort by the clinton campaign to reassure supporters that it has learned from her 2008 campaign, which was plagued by missteps, including a failure to match the organizational and digital prowess of barack obama, who ultimately won the democratic nomination   and the general election.  clinton’s campaign raised more than $112 million last year for the primary fight, according to a previously released statement from jan. 1. that includes $37 million raised in the fourth quarter. the campaign had nearly $38 million in cash on hand headed into this year, according to the statement. the year end report only notes budget categories as a percentage of total spending and does not include dollar amounts for categories or line items. nor did the document include a dollar amount for the overall budget. through the third quarter of last year, the campaign spent more than $12 million on direct marketing, online ads and media buys, according to campaign finance filings.  federal elections commission filings for the fourth quarter for all presidential campaigns are due jan. 31.

" four men suspected of killing the north korean leader s half brother at a malaysian airport changed their clothes and appearance to escape detection, a police witness said on thursday.  the four, who are still at large, are charged together with two women   indonesian siti aisyah and doan thi huong from vietnam   with killing kim jong nam at kuala lumpur airport s budget terminal on feb. 13. prosecutors in the malaysian court say siti aisyah and huong conspired with the men to murder kim, by smearing his face with liquid vx, a chemical poison banned by the united nations. defense lawyers have argued the women did not know they were handling poison and thought they were involved in a prank for a reality tv show.    the men had been formerly identified only as mr. chang, mr. y, james, and hanamori, also known as grandpa  or  uncle , which a police witness has said were assumed names. the men changed clothes after the attack, before they were seen leaving the airport, police investigator wan azirul nizam che wan aziz told the court.   they were trying to confuse (observers),  wan azirul said, describing closed circuit television recordings made on the day of the killing.  more than 40 cctv video clips of the men s movements at the airport were screened in the darkened courtroom.      they showed mr. chang and mr. y heading to different bathrooms in the airport before emerging in different clothes, shortly after the attack on kim jong nam.  mr. chang, who had earlier been seen wearing a goatee, also came out of the bathroom clean shaven.  all of the suspects at large, even though they changed clothes, did not change their shoes,  added wan azirul, who said the shoes were among the features enabling identification of the suspects, besides their body types and movements.  other videos showed mr. chang and mr. y meeting separately with a man, identified as hanamori, at a restaurant near the airport s check in counters, prior to the attack. hanamori was seen arriving at the restaurant with a fourth man, who wan azirul said was suspected to be james . mr. chang later met alone with siti aisyah at the restaurant, while mr. y was seen walking past the restaurant with huong. it is unclear whether the four suspects at large were the same four north koreans authorities described as having left kuala lumpur for pyongyang on the day of the killing.  an interpol alert has been issued for the four who left, identified as north koreans ri ji hyon, hong song hac, o jong gil, and ri jae nam.      u.s. and south korean officials have said agents of kim jong un s regime masterminded the murder. the trial will resume on nov 6.

" president donald trump’s temporary ban on travelers from six muslim majority countries cannot stop grandparents and other relatives of united states citizens from entering the country, a u.s. judge said on thursday. the ruling by u.s. district judge derrick watson in honolulu also opens the door for more refugees and deals trump a fresh courtroom defeat in a long back and forth over an executive order that has gone all the way up to the u.s. supreme court. the state of hawaii had asked watson to narrowly interpret a supreme court ruling that revived parts of trump’s march 6 executive order banning travelers from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. the supreme court last month said the ban could take effect, but that anyone from the six countries with a “bona fide relationship” to a u.s. person or entity could not be barred. the trump administration then interpreted that opinion to allow spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings into the country, but barred grandparents and other family members, in a measure trump called necessary to prevent attacks.  watson harshly criticized the government’s definition of close family relations as “the antithesis of common sense” in a  ruling that changes the way the ban can now be implemented. “common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents. indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members,” he wrote. a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment. trump’s order is a pretext for illegal discrimination, hawaii attorney general douglas chin said in a statement. “family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough,” chin said. chin had asked watson for an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the united states. hawaii and refugee groups also had argued that resettlement agencies have a “bona fide” relationship with the refugees they help, sometimes over the course of years. the justice department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law. watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the u.s. because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.  “‘bona fide’ does not get any more ‘bona fide’ than that,” watson said.  melanie nezer, vice president of global refugee advocacy group hias, said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the united states, beyond a cap of  50,000 set by the executive order. that limit was reached this week.  “we are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members,” said becca heller, director of the international refugee assistance project. more than 24,000 additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the u.s. under watson’s order, she estimated.  watson did not grant everything the state of hawaii sought, however. he rejected a request to categorically exempt all iraqis refugee applicants who believe they are at risk due to their work for the u.s. government since march, 2003, as interpreters and translators, for instance. watson also refused a blanket exemption for those eligible to apply to a refugee program aimed at protecting certain children at risk in el salvador, honduras, and guatemala. the roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in january, when trump first signed a more expansive version of his order. that sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

" a journalist became the second woman to enter russia s presidential race, saying on monday she wanted to use the election to campaign for the rights of single mothers and children. the presidential election takes place in march next year. president vladimir putin is expected to stand and win, but has yet to confirm his plans. some opposition activists believe the kremlin s aim is to crown the field with candidates designed to distract and entertain in order to boost turnout and divide the liberal opposition.  the kremlin denies that, saying anyone who meets the legal criteria to run can take part. on monday, mother of two ekaterina gordon, 37, who has worked as a tv and radio talk show host, said she was putting herself forward as an independent presidential candidate. she said she had never voted, but had become disillusioned by both the liberal opposition and pro kremlin politicians.  i understood that everyone is fed from the same trough,  gordon said in an online video.  there are many populist themes ... but there is one reality   we are a country of single mothers, and no one gives a damn about them.  she said she had not agreed her candidacy with the kremlin and had experience of the kind of problems russian woman faced due to her ownership of a law firm. another female candidate, russian tv personality ksenia sobchak, said earlier this month she planned to run for president, offering liberal voters unhappy with putin s rule someone to back, though she, like gordon, has little prospect of winning. post soviet russia has never had a female president.   kremlin critic and opposition leader alexei navalny wants to run too, but russia s central election commission has declared him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence, which he says was politically motivated.

" presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said on monday that if elected, she would pressure u.s. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical islamist groups killed 49 people in an orlando nightclub. in a speech in cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. she is campaigning against presumptive republican nominee donald trump ahead of the november presidential election.  “we already know we need more resources for this fight. the professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out,” clinton said. “that’s why i’ve proposed an ‘intelligence surge’ to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.” while clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications. clinton’s comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in paris, brussels and san bernardino, california. omar mateen, the 29 year old orlando shooter and a u.s. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the united states, fbi director james comey said monday. facebook (fb.o), alphabet’s google (googl.o) and twitter (twtr.n) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by islamic militants within the past year. but they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities. the companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored internet, according to technologists.  counterterrorism experts have also long said so called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others. twitter and facebook had no immediate response to questions about clinton’s comments. google declined comment. the center for democracy and technology and electronic frontier foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from clinton before commenting. unlike trump, clinton did not call for blocking online content. she did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of muslim americans as “dangerous.” ",0

" a number of u.s. cities are introducing proposals to mandate community oversight of police use of digital surveillance technology as evidence mounts that black or poor neighborhoods are being more heavily scrutinized than others, civil rights activists said on wednesday. the legislative measures are being introduced by lawmakers in 11 cities from seattle to washington, d.c., and are backed by a coalition of 17 groups led by the american civil liberties union and the national association for the advancement of colored people. “(we need) to build the legislative power of local communities to prevent high tech racial profiling and policing from turning our neighborhoods into open air prisons,” malkia cyril, executive director of the center for media justice, told reporters on a conference call during which the proposals were announced on wednesday. the coalition said the proposals stemmed from the growing use by departments across the country of high tech equipment or software, some of which was developed for battlefields, to surreptitiously monitor poor or predominately black neighborhoods, muslims, or the street level movements of activists within the black lives matter movement. the proposed bills would mandate city council approval of the use and purchase of surveillance equipment, and input and oversight from communities on how it is used. “we want to give municipalities the ability to say ‘no,’” cyril said.  proposals were introduced on wednesday in miami beach and pensacola, florida, and others were expected in the coming weeks in new york city, milwaukee, muskegon, michigan, and other localities, the american civil liberties union (aclu) said. palo alto, california, will vote on its proposal later in september, and hattiesburg, mississippi, is introducing legislation in october, the aclu said. police departments across the united states are facing intense scrutiny over the use of excessive force especially against black people, accountability and accusations of racial bias. police officials have said digital surveillance tools are needed for crime prevention and pointed to reduced crime in some areas where they are used. the coalition said blacks have been disproportionately targeted by automatic license plate readers in oakland, california, closed circuit television surveillance in lansing, michigan, a ‘stingray’ that mimics cell phone towers to track a phone user’s location in baltimore, maryland, and social media monitoring software.",0

" the key to british hopes of moving on to talks on trade ties with the european union after it quits the bloc lies in dublin, the european council president said on friday as ireland called for  credible  solutions from london for the irish border.  avoiding a return to a  hard border  on the island of ireland is the last major hurdle before brexit talks can advance to trade ties and a possible two year brexit transition deal. but european council president donald tusk that while the eu negotiating team represents the interests of the 27 other members, ireland will have the final say on the border issue.   let me say very clearly: if the uk offer is unacceptable for ireland, it will also be unacceptable for the eu,  tusk said in dublin at a joint press conference with irish prime minister leo varadkar.   the key to the uk s future lies   in some ways   in dublin, at least as long as brexit negotiations continue.    tusk confirmed he had given british prime minister theresa may a deadline of monday to make a final offer on irish border conditions before eu heads of government decide whether there is  sufficient progress  on a uk eu divorce settlement to merit opening talks on the future relationship. if london meets the three key eu conditions on its financial bill for leaving, the rights of expatriate citizens and the border, then leaders could give a green light to trade talks at the summit on dec. 14 15. with significant headway on the financial settlement and citizen rights now apparently in the bag, a deal on the irish border appears to be the final hurdle. the political and economic stakes are high. the economy of ireland, north and south, has become deeply integrated since the eu single market s creation in 1993, and only road signs now mark the frontier. free flowing commerce, together with the 1998 peace deal between northern ireland s protestants and catholics, has transformed previously neglected areas on both sides of the boundary. varadkar said that while progress on the border issue had been made, the next few days would be crucial and that ireland would not be afraid to use its veto if necessary.   the uk must offer credible, concrete and workable solutions that guarantee that there will be no hard border...whatever the future relationship between the eu and the uk is,  he said.  i m an optimist by nature...however i m also prepared to stand firm with our partners if need be...if the uk offer falls short.   before it can sign off on the first phase, dublin wants may to spell out in writing how she intends to make good on a commitment to avoid turning the clock back to a border of customs and security checks. it says the best way to do so is to keep regulations the same on both sides of a border that will be the uk s only land boundary with the eu after brexit. may s government has said britain will leave the eu s single market and customs union but wants the irish border to remain open, a stance that eu officials say is contradictory. earlier on friday irish foreign minister simon coveney said a deal on the border was  doable  but that the sides were  not there yet. coveney said negotiators were working to find  sensible wording , drafts of which were being exchanged. dublin, he said, will insist  there will be no fudge . may s room to offer additional concessions to dublin appeared extremely limited when the pro brexit northern ireland party propping up her government on thursday hinted it might withdraw its support if she gives up too much.  but coveney said the irish government and the democratic unionist party (dup) agreed on far more than it disagreed on.  may is also under pressure from british business leaders who want confirmation of a transition deal so they have time to adapt to the new relationship.

" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on tuesday nine war ships set for construction in 2020 will be fitted with long range  anti missile defense systems to counter the threat of rogue nations. australia s proposed frigates will use aegis combat systems, produced by lockheed martin, in conjunction with saab australia technology, turnbull said. tensions in the region have spiked considerably in recent months as north korea conducted a series of tests of its medium  and long range ballistic missiles, some of which flew over japan, as well as its sixth nuclear test on sept. 3. pyongyang, which ultimately wants to target the u.s. mainland with a nuclear tipped ballistic missile, has said its missiles could strike australia.  recent events in our region have proven that australia s future frigates must be equipped to defend australia from the threat of medium  and long range missile attacks,  turnbull said in a speech in sydney. work on the frigates is set to begin in 2020, with bae systems, navantia and fincantieri all competing for the a$35 billion ($27.39 billion) contract. turnbull said the decision to award the missile defense system contract allows the three bidders enough time to incorporate aegis technology into their bids. australia is expected to announce the winner of the frigate contract in early 2018. the decision to fit the frigates   also a cornerstone of australia s plan to counter an expected rise in submarine activity in the region   suggests canberra will use the ships in a dual capacity.  the missile defense will protect australia s forward based forces and in a coalition scenario,  said euan graham, director of the national security program at the lowy institute, an australian think tank. countering submarines requires vessels that move freely in the region, in contrast to static vessels used for detecting missiles. the decision to use the aegis ballistic missile defense systems brings australia in line with u.s., japanese and korean vessels, allowing international cooperation, vice admiral tim barrett, australia s navy chief, told reporters in sydney.  the choice of the aegis system allows australia to plug into the u.s. alliance. they will be able to share data from vessels and potentially aircraft,  said graham. the frigates will be the next major component of australia s plan to increase defense spending by a$30 billion to be worth a$195 billion, or 2 percent of gdp, by 2021 2022 as canberra seeks to protect its strategic and trade interests in the asia pacific. australia selected french naval contractor dcns last year to build its fleet of 12 submarines, ahead of other offers from japan and germany, one the world s most lucrative defense contracts.

" court ordered mediation aimed at ending a funding dispute between minnesota’s democratic governor and the republican controlled legislature ended on friday with the mediator declaring an impasse. the minnesota supreme court earlier this month ordered the two branches of government to use a mediator to resolve a dispute over governor mark dayton’s veto of funding for the legislature in the fiscal 2018 19 biennial budget. richard solum, a retired minnesota judge who served as the mediator, said in a statement that after a day and a half of talks he concluded the two sides were at an impasse. dayton’s veto in may touched off a legal battle with the legislature, which claimed the removal of nearly $130 million in funding from the budget was unconstitutional. while a ramsey county district court judge sided with the legislature in july, the state supreme court on sept. 8 determined that the governor’s action was constitutional. however, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to continue to exist without funding. dayton on friday reiterated his stance that his veto was aimed at pressuring republicans to revise tax measures, which he said “will seriously jeopardize minnesota government’s future financial stability.” he added that mediation revealed the legislature has money available to operate until its new session begins in february. “they owe the minnesota supreme court and the people of minnesota an honest explanation of why they have dragged all of us into their costly theatrics over the past four months,” dayton said in a statement. republican legislative leaders issued a joint statement expressing disappointment that “governor dayton walked out and abruptly ended mediation today.” the demise of mediation returns the matter to the supreme court for a final ruling, according to susan closmore, a spokeswoman for house republicans. dayton’s veto raised credit concerns for the state by leaving $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a senate office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in november and december. after the district court judge ordered the state to temporarily fund the legislature until oct. 1, s&p on june 30 affirmed minnesota’s aa plus rating and removed it from a watch list for a potential downgrade.

" the texas republican spearheading tax reform efforts in the u.s. house of representatives will meet with democrats to discuss policy ideas, as republicans try to secure a victory for president donald trump after his healthcare bill’s failure. house ways and means committee chair kevin brady said the meeting with his panel’s 16 democratic members will focus on ways to simplify the u.s. tax code for individuals and stop u.s. companies from moving production and research facilities overseas   both key house republican tax reform objectives.   “at the end of the day, i don’t want to make a prediction as to where that goes. but i think this engagement’s important,” brady told reporters on monday. “i’d love to have them bring their ideas on how we leapfrog america back into the lead as the most competitive place on earth for that new business.”  the meeting is expected to take place on wednesday, according to house aides.  a spokesman for ways and means democrats had no immediate comment.   brady said the meeting has nothing to do with the healthcare debacle on march 24, when the republican controlled house pulled legislation to repeal and replace the healthcare law known as obamacare when it became clear that republicans would fall short of the votes needed. trump blamed the failure on hardline republican conservatives who opposed the bill and threatened to reach out to democrats. but the trump administration has signaled an interest in finding bipartisan support for tax reform legislation, billed as the first comprehensive overhaul of the u.s. tax code since 1986. the white house has also shown signs of moving away from the house tax reform blueprint backed by brady and house speaker paul ryan, informing republican lawmakers on march 16 that all options were on the table.  the house blueprint, which democrats oppose, calls for sweeping changes and tax cuts that would mainly benefit the wealthy. but it has divided the business community and republicans over a border adjustment tax provision that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports while exempting export revenues from tax. white house officials told lawmakers last month that they were seriously considering other options, including deficit funded tax cuts and a european style value added tax for businesses. brady expects to unveil tax reform legislation this spring, with a full house vote as early as the summer.

" the u.s. treasury department on wednesday imposed new sanctions on five russians and chechens, including the head of the russian republic of chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses.  the new sanctions blacklisted ramzan kadyrov, the chechen leader and a close ally of russian president vladimir putin, the treasury department said in a statement.  u.s. authorities accused kadyrov of overseeing  an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings . on a conference call with reporters wednesday, a senior u.s. state department official said that  one or more of kadyrov s political opponents were killed at his direction.   kadyrov reacted to news of the sanctions with his usual defiance.  a sleepless night is waiting for me,  kadyrov wrote, apparently sarcastically, on his instagram social media account.  i can be proud that i m out of favor with the special services of the usa. in fact, the usa cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of america s special services.  he also wrote that he would not be visiting the united states. the u.s. treasury department imposed the sanctions, which freeze the banks accounts of those targeted, under a 2012 law known as the magnitsky act.  the magnitsky act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on russian officials linked to the death in prison of sergei magnitsky, a 37 year old russian auditor and whistleblower. the act also seeks to hold responsible those u.s. authorities allege orchestrated or benefited from the death of magnitsky.   treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the sergei magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,  director of the treasury department s office of foreign assets control john smith said in a statement. magnitsky was arrested and died in a moscow jail in 2009 after discovering a $230 million tax fraud scheme, according to u.s. authorities. supporters of magnitsky say the russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care after he was imprisoned on tax evasion charges. the kremlin denies the allegation. in addition to kadyrov and one other chechen official, the treasury s action on wednesday targeted three russians that u.s. authorities say were involved in the complex tax fraud scheme that magnitsky exposed. the magnitsky sanctions have been a point of tension between moscow and washington, even before russia s annexation of crimea sent relations spiraling. in retaliation for the magnitsky act, putin signed a bill halting u.s. adoptions of russian children. it had been unclear to sanctions experts whether president donald trump s administration, which has signaled a desire to rebuild ties with moscow, would continue to target people under the law.  the magnitsky act attracted greater public attention when it emerged that the president s son donald trump jr., had met with a russian lawyer and a lobbyist   both strident opponents of the law   in new york ahead of the 2016 u.s. elections. when asked about the june 2016 meeting, trump jr. later said they discussed the adoptions issue. on a conference call with reporters on wednesday, state department officials said that despite the new sanctions the trump administration wants a constructive relationship with moscow.  we believe a russia that takes care of the human rights of its own citizens will be an even more effective partner,  a senior state department official said.

" the u.s. justice department, in the face of rising pressure from capitol hill, named former fbi chief robert mueller on wednesday as special counsel to investigate alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election and possible collusion between president donald trump’s campaign and moscow. the move followed a week in which the white house was thrown into uproar after trump fired fbi director james comey. democrats and some of the president’s fellow republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether russia tried to sway the outcome of november’s election in favor of trump and against democrat hillary clinton. trump, whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks, took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite, move on and refocus on his stalled agenda, a senior white house official said. “we are all in this together,” trump told his team, the official said. trump said in a statement after the justice department announcement he looked forward to a quick resolution. “as i have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” he said. mueller said in a statement tweeted by cbs news: “i accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.”  trump, who said in a speech earlier on wednesday that no  politician in history “has been treated worse or more unfairly,” has long bristled at the notion that russia played any role in his election victory. the russia issue has, however, clouded his early months in office. moscow has denied the conclusion by u.s. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the campaign. pressure on the white house intensified after trump fired comey, who had been leading a federal probe into the matter, and allegations that trump had asked comey to end the fbi investigation into ties between trump’s first national security adviser, michael flynn, and russia. that raised questions about whether the president improperly attempted to interfere with a federal investigation. the issue spilled over onto wall street on wednesday, where the s&p 500 and the dow had their biggest one day declines since september as investor hopes for tax cuts and other pro business policies faded amid the political tumult. the justice department announcement came after the market close. “my decision (to appoint a special counsel) is not the finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. i have made no such determination,” deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said in a statement announcing the special counsel. “i determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the american people to have full confidence in the outcome,” he said. trump heard about mueller’s appointment from his white house lawyer don mcgahn about 25 minutes before it was made public, the senior white house official said. trump assembled his inner circle in the oval office   vice president mike pence, chief of staff reince preibus, economic adviser gary cohn, senior strategist steve bannon, and others   and gave them a pep talk, dictating the statement that was soon released. trump told them the appointment would allow them to refer questions to mueller, giving them space to focus on policies such as tax reform. lawmakers on capitol hill generally welcomed the justice department action and praised mueller for his integrity, but house and senate republican leaders said they would go on with their own investigations of the russia matter. “a special counsel is very much needed in this situation and deputy attorney general rosenstein has done the right thing,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a statement. republican house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte said he was confident mueller “will conduct a thorough and fair investigation.” a discordant note was sounded by republican representative jason chaffetz, chairman of the house of representatives oversight committee, who praised mueller’s credentials but said: “i don’t think they should have appointed someone.” “i have not seen any evidence of actual collusion. where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute,” chaffetz told fox news. mueller, 72, was decorated as a marine corps officer during the vietnam war. a former federal prosecutor, he is known for his tough, no nonsense managerial style. appointed by republican president george w. bush, he became fbi director one week before the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. he was asked by democratic president barack obama in 2011 to stay on for two more years and was replaced by comey in 2013. mueller was credited with transforming the fbi, putting more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other u.s. government agencies. although mueller will serve at the pleasure of rosenstein, the job comes with independence and autonomy. some past independent investigations have stretched for years. kenneth starr, who investigated former president bill clinton, probed allegations surrounding clinton’s past real estate deals but later expanded the inquiry into his relations with then white house intern monica lewinsky, leading to clinton’s impeachment by the house. the white house was conducting interviews on wednesday of candidates to replace comey as head of the fbi. a senior administration official said former democratic vice presidential candidate and senator joe lieberman, one of those interviewed by trump, was among the leading candidates. trump’s spokesman, sean spicer, said others being interviewed were acting fbi director andrew mccabe, former oklahoma governor frank keating and former senior fbi official richard mcfeely.

" the white house will comply with a request from the u.s. government’s ethics agency to provide information on which former lobbyists are working in the administration, an administration official said on friday. mick mulvaney, director of the office of management and budget (omb), said in a letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by the office of government ethics to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from walter shaub, the director of the office of government ethics (oge). “omb shares the belief that the executive branch must uphold the highest ethical standards in accordance with the law,” mulvaney wrote. “our concern was, and is, protecting the process related to the data call.” shaub, an appointee under president barack obama in the final year of five year term, had requested in april copies of waivers the administration of president donald trump granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  but omb requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from shaub. he called the request “highly unusual” and said his agency has the authority to take “corrective action proceedings” against agencies that refuse its requests. in his friday response, mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle oge efforts but rather to provide more time to “ensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions.” “omb has never sought to impede oge,” he wrote. mulvaney closed the letter by saying the omb did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself. shortly after taking office in january, trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work. but the administration has the power to grant waivers to particular hires, exempting them from that restriction.

" donald trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in american political history when he toppled hillary clinton in the u.s. presidential election on tuesday   and he did it using far less cash than his rival.     relying heavily on an unorthodox mix of social media, unfiltered rhetoric, and a knack for winning free tv time, the new york real estate businessman likely paid less than $5 per vote during his insurgent white house bid, about half what clinton paid, according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance records and voting data. those figures assume the candidates spent all the funds they raised.     trump’s cost effective win has upended prevailing concepts about the influence of money in american politics and raised the question of whether a lean, media savvy campaign can become the new model for winning office in the united states.     political strategists and academics tend to agree, however, that trump’s performance would be tough to repeat. a household name for his luxury brand resorts, reality tv stardom, and ability to surround himself with non stop controversy, trump held advantages that many political candidates lack.     “i think this is a case where trump had unique characteristics as a candidate that allowed him to pursue a different type of strategy,” said tony corrado, a professor of government at colby college in maine.      in total, trump raised at least $270 million since launching his campaign in june 2015, a little more than a third of the money that obama’s re election campaign spent in 2012, according to the most recent filings with the federal elections commission.  with vote counting wrapping up in the early hours of wednesday, trump had won some 59 million votes nationwide in the general election. that amounts to less than $5 per vote for the $270 million he spent.     according to data analytics firm mediaquant, trump garnered about $5 billion worth of free media coverage during the election campaign, more than twice the amount earned by clinton, a lifelong politician who served as secretary of state, senator, and first lady at different times in her career.     mediaquant adds up all the unpaid coverage the candidates earn in newspapers, magazines and social media and then compares the sum to what a comparable amount of coverage, with the same kind of reach, would have cost in advertising.      trump has also frequently dominated news cycles with provocative rhetoric that breaks taboos, including unabashed insults targeting women he dislikes over twitter, or unusual policy proscriptions like his call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country to prevent domestic attacks, or to force mexico to pay for a multi billion dollar border wall to keep out immigrants.     trump made his self funding a selling point early in his campaign as he fended off 16 republican rivals for the party nomination, arguing that by eschewing big donors he was not beholden to special interests.      but once he secured the nomination, trump changed course and began fundraising in earnest, replicating the small dollar fundraising juggernaut of another insurgent candidate, democrat bernie sanders, along the way.         clinton raised at least $521 million, according to filings.          the former secretary of state stuck to the more traditional campaigning model of launching expensive television ads and funding hundreds of staffers who fanned across the country to work to increase voter turnout on election day.      she spent more than $237 million on television ads and more than $42 million on hundreds of staffers.     she also benefited from spending by the super pacs supporting her candidacy, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign. more than a dozen people, including hedge fund magnate donald sussman and global financier george soros, wrote multi million checks to priorities usa, the primary pac supporting her campaign, according to filings.     michael traugott, a political science professor at the university of michigan, said the traditional u.s. model for picking presidents might seem odd to people in other nations, where campaigns are shorter and require less cash.     “the system is clearly broken,” traugott said.

" lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives introduced long stalled legislation on thursday that would make it a federal crime to share sexually explicit material of a person online without the subject’s consent. the “intimate privacy protection act” is an effort several years in the making to combat the rise in recent years of “revenge porn,” images that are shared on the internet in order to extort or humiliate someone. the practice disproportionately affects women. “these acts of bullying have ruined careers, families, and even led to suicide,” representative jackie speier, a california democrat and lead author of the bill, said in a statement.  the legislation would allow fines and up to five years in prison for posting online or distributing sexually explicit photos or videos with “reckless disregard” for the consent of the subject. more than 30 states have enacted similar laws in recent years.  exceptions listed in the bill would allow for posting material that is in the public interest or that features a person voluntarily posing nude in a public or commercial setting. the bill stalled for years amid concerns raised by technology companies and internet freedom advocates worried that service providers such as alphabet inc’s youtube could be exposed to liability for acting as third party hosts of revenge porn content shared by users.  speier’s bill, which was introduced with support from facebook and twitter, exempts such companies as long as they do not promote or solicit revenge porn content. many tech companies have tightened their terms of service in recent years to prohibit revenge porn. those companies typically rely on users to report objectionable content to teams of human reviewers who delete content found to violate terms of service. democratic representatives katherine clark and gregory meeks and republican representatives ryan costello and tom rooney joined the bill as original co sponsors.

" pennsylvania governor tom wolf raised the minimum wage for state workers and employees of some contractors by 40 percent to $10.15 an hour on monday, a gesture aimed in part at putting pressure on republican lawmakers. wolf, a democrat, who signed an executive order to make the change, acknowledged that only 450 of the state’s 79,000 employees, mainly temporary workers hired during tax season, are currently paid less than $10.15 an hour. he said he hoped to send a message to the republican dominated legislature to enact a similar increase for all pennsylvania residents. “an increase in the minimum wage will lead to increases in employee morale, productivity, and quality of work and decreases in turnover and the cost of training and supervision,” said wolf, who lacks the power to order the statewide increase.  at a press conference, wolf said a statewide increase would benefit business in the long run. fourteen states have a minimum wage of at least $10. the governor said inflation had pushed the value of the state’s current $7.25 minimum wage below the poverty line. going forward, the state would adjust the minimum wage for government workers to keep up with inflation, he said. wolf did not specify where the money would come from when questioned during the news conference.  pennsylvania has been without a state budget since july 1 because of republican resistance to raising taxes and wolf’s refusal to sign a budget that he said would lead to a gaping structural deficit. the wage increase announced for state employees would cost the state $1.5 million and will take effect immediately. it would apply to many but not all contractors doing business with the state, costing the state an extra $2.6 million.  about 60 percent of that will go to contract employees at the state’s photo license bureaus, but only when those contracts are renewed.  the minimum wage increase will not apply for now to human service agencies funded by the state, wolf said, because they are already “stressed” by delayed funding caused by the budget stand off. senate majority leader jake corman accused wolf of acting like president barack obama by seeking to implement policy changes through executive orders. “choosing to take symbolic executive action on this issue instead of working with the legislature underscores his failures to collaborate,” corman said in a statement.

" u.s. senator john mccain, who recently returned to washington after treatment for brain cancer, said on sunday the disease is vicious but that the treatment is going well and he has more energy than before. “this is a very vicious form of cancer that i’m facing,” mccain, a republican who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, told cnn’s “state of the union” program. the 80 year old arizona senator was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, after surgery in july for a blood clot above his left eye. “all the results so far are excellent,” mccain said of his treatment, adding that the prognosis was “pretty good.” “i’m facing a challenge, but i’ve faced other challenges, and i’m very confident about getting through this one as well,” the senator said. “i’ve had no side effects, no nothing except frankly an increased level of energy.” mccain recently completed his first round of chemotherapy and radiation, and he said that he would have an mri on monday, an imaging technique used to evaluate medical conditions. mccain, who chairs the senate armed services committee, is also going to oversee work on a defense policy bill on the senate floor next week.    “every life has to end one way or another,” he told cnn,  adding that he was very happy with his life, including the 2008 campaign that he lost to former president barack obama.  “i am able to celebrate a wonderful life and i will be grateful for additional time that i have,” mccain said, adding: “remember, i’m the guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at the naval academy.” mccain was re elected to a sixth senate term in november. in the past, he has been treated for melanoma, a form of skin cancer. he is the son and grandson of navy admirals, and a u.s. navy pilot whose plane was shot down over vietnam in 1967. he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in north vietnam and was tortured repeatedly. mccain said sunday he hoped that people would remember him as someone who had served his country. “made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of errors, but served his country, and i hope we could add, honorably.” ",0
" prime minister theresa may set out her quest to tackle social and racial injustice on tuesday, hoping to shift the focus of her conservative party s annual conference away from rifts over britain s exit from the european union and her leadership. after a bruising start to the party s annual meeting in the city of manchester, may will try to reset the agenda after remarks on brexit policy by foreign minister boris johnson that deepened divisions in her top team of advisers. she said an audit will be published on oct. 10 spelling out the  uncomfortable truths  of life in britain, showing how people of different racial backgrounds are treated in the health, education, employment and the criminal justice system. her ministers will also announce policies to try to prove critics wrong and show that her government is working, including measures to toughen sentences of people streaming or browsing extremist material, and to increase nurse training.  in doing this ground breaking work we are holding a mirror up to our society,  may said in a statement.  my most fundamental political belief is that how far you go in life should be based on your talent and how hard you work   and nothing else.  but in early morning broadcast interviews, may was repeatedly asked about her relationship with johnson after he set out four personal red lines for the brexit negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union.  i don t set red lines,  may told bbc television, describing her cabinet of top ministers as united over brexit.  leadership is about ensuring that you have a team of people who aren t yes men, but a team of people of different voices around the table so that we can discuss matters, come to an agreement and then put that government view forward, and that is exactly what we ve done.  may promised to build a  country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few  when she became prime minister just over a year ago after britons voted narrowly to leave the eu and her predecessor david cameron stepped down. but she has had to shelve many of her domestic policies   such as social care and corporate reforms   since losing the conservatives  majority in parliament in a june election. that setback has undermined the party s confidence in her ability to lead it into the next election, due in 2022. the preliminary findings of the audit showed that the unemployment rate for black, asian and minority ethnic people of working age is nearly double that for white groups, while more than nine in 10 headteachers are white, the government said. the findings, the government says, can help better target training and mentoring programs.  the idea itself is not new,  may said.  charles booth s maps of rich and poor areas in victorian london drew attention to hardship that was too often hidden   but this focus on how ethnicity affects people s lives will present findings that are uncomfortable.

" the first latin american leader to visit u.s. president donald trump at the white house said on friday that he told trump he prefers bridges to walls and favors the free movement of people across borders. however, peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski declined to comment specifically on trump’s proposal to build a wall along the u.s. mexican border to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking in a press conference following the meeting. “i don’t want to get into the wall,” kuczynski, a former wall street investment banker said in a video distributed by his office. “we’re interested in the free movement of people ... i emphasized that to president trump and we prefer bridges to walls.” kuczynski has previously likened trump’s wall proposal to the berlin wall and once joked that he would cut off ties with the united states if trump were elected president. kuczynski later congratulated trump on his surprise electoral victory and described their talk on friday as “cordial and constructive.” trump called peru, a country of 30 million in south america, “a fantastic neighbor” and said it was an honor to have kuczynski in the white house, according to video showing the two posing for pictures after the meeting. kuczynski said the two leaders only briefly discussed peru’s fugitive former president alejandro toledo, whom peru had asked trump to deport from the united states under a provision of migratory law that allows for deportations to preserve diplomatic ties. “this is a matter of the judiciary that was not discussed for more than a few seconds,” kuczynski said of toledo. up until a week ago, kuczynski’s centrist government had seen deporting toledo as a better alternative to a potentially lengthy process of peru’s judiciary seeking his arrest and eventual extradition. toledo is wanted in connection with a far reaching graft probe and has denied prosecutors’ allegations that he took $20 million in bribes from brazilian builder odebrecht sa. in discussing migration, kuczynski said he emphasized to trump that only 70 peruvians out of 1 million living in the united states are in jail, 200,000 of whom are there illegally.     “peru has not exported criminals to the united states,” kuczynski said. “they’re nurses, they’re doctors, they’re all sorts of people.” ",0
" the widow of a slain navy seal whose story was turned into the hit movie “american sniper” has become a prominent figure in fort worth republican politics even though her name does not appear on tuesday’s primary ballot. taya kyle, the wife of chris kyle, is campaign treasurer for a republican opponent of longtime tarrant county sheriff dee anderson, the lawman seen as the face of the manhunt for “affluenza” teen ethan couch. kyle is also in a dispute with her late husband’s former business partner bo french, who is running as a republican for a texas house of representatives seat from the same county.  lawyers for kyle sent a cease and desist letter to the french camp last week calling on it to stop using her husband’s name and likeness in campaign materials. “bo (is) abusing the name of my late husband, a beloved son of texas, and a hero to the nation, in an attempt to manipulate voters,” kyle said in a statement on social media. she did not respond to requests to speak about her political activism. “her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down,” said republican political strategist bill miller. “she’s become a very formidable woman.” chris and taya kyle have become stars of the state’s republican establishment, with governor greg abbott setting up a day to honor the memory of chris kyle, who was killed in 2013 by a troubled veteran he was trying to mentor.  taya kyle last year endorsed former governor rick perry in his unsuccessful bid for the republican presidential nomination. she now endorses u.s. senator ted cruz of texas.  in the sheriff’s race, she may be the difference in the campaign of bill waybourn, a former suburban fort worth police chief, analysts said. waybourn, backed by the conservative tea party movement, is challenging anderson, a fellow republican, who gained national attention in calling for the apprehension of couch. the teen, whose lawyer said his wealth distorted his moral compass, fled to mexico in december apparently to avoid apprehension for violating the probation deal that kept him out of jail for a drunken driving wreck in 2013 that killed four people. kyle, 41, has not indicated any intention to seek elective office, but analysts said that should not be ruled out. “once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, it’s hard to get out,” miller said.

" north korea has ratcheted up international tension and fear with its sixth and largest nuclear test on sunday, but south koreans feel increasingly doubtful it would start a war, a poll showed on friday. a gallup korea survey found that 58 percent of south koreans felt there was no possibility north korea will cause a war, while 37 percent said they thought it would. gallup korea began asking south koreans the question in 1992, and the percentage of respondents this time who thought the north would not start a war was the second highest since then. in the first poll in 1992, 69 percent of those questioned thought the north would start a war while only 24 percent thought it would not. the survey released on friday showed south koreans were considerably less concerned about war compared with june 2007, nine months after north korea conducted its first nuclear test, in september 2006. in 2007, 51 percent of respondents said they expected a war, while 45 percent did not. north korea says it needs to develop weapons to protect itself against u.s. aggression. it has been steadily pursuing its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international condemnation and has threatened more action in response to any new u.n. sanctions and u.s. pressure. despite the north s fiery rhetoric, south koreans are generally calm, going about their lives with no sign of panic.  the survey results show south koreans have likely grown accustomed to its repeated threats of provocation after over 60 years in a ceasefire state,  gallup korea said in a statement. south korea and the united states are technically still at war with north korea after the 1950 53 korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. the poll also found that 60 percent of those surveyed believed south korea should arm itself with nuclear weapons while 35 percent disagreed.  those in their twenties were most opposed to the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons, while respondents 50 and above said the south should have them. gallup also said 59 percent of respondents were against the idea of the united states attacking north korea first should north korean provocations continue, while 33 percent said it should. gallup korea said the poll was carried out from sept. 5 to 7. a total of 1,004 south koreans over the age of 19 were polled by telephone, it said.  the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump rolled to victory on saturday in south carolina in a contest that saw former florida governor jeb bush drop out, while democratic hopeful hillary clinton beat back a strong challenge from bernie sanders in nevada. the victories by trump, who is running as an anti establishment outsider, and clinton, a preeminent political insider, solidified their positions as the front runners to win their parties’ respective nominations ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. the night’s most prominent casualty, bush suffered a distant fourth place finish in the republican contest and announced he had suspended his campaign, ending his dream of becoming a third bush president after his father and brother. “the people of iowa, new hampshire and south carolina have spoken, and i really respect their decision,” an emotional bush said in columbia. he finished far out of the running in each of the first three states. by winning both south carolina and new hampshire and holding leads in 13 states that hold republican contests on march 1, trump was arguably on track to win the nomination, an outcome that seemed astounding to contemplate when he entered the race last summer. “it’s going to be very difficult for him to be derailed at this point,” said hogan gidley, who was a senior adviser to former republican candidate mike huckabee.    the 69 year old real estate billionaire and reality tv star was declared the winner in south carolina about an hour after polls closed, and launched into a feisty victory speech.  “let’s put this thing away,” trump told cheering supporters in spartanburg. he denounced tv pundits for saying there could be enough anti trump votes to beat him when the race thins further. “these geniuses,” he said. “they don’t understand that as people drop out, i’m going to get a lot of those votes also. you don’t just add them together.” trump easily defeated florida senator marco rubio and texas senator ted cruz, who were in a close fight for second place and the right to declare themselves the anti trump alternative. with 99 percent of south carolina precincts reporting, trump had 32.5 percent, followed by rubio with 22.5 percent and cruz with 22.3 percent.  cruz’s inability to distinguish himself from rubio in the state was a blow to his campaign, which had invested heavily there to rally support among south carolina’s large population of evangelical voters. trump’s victory won him at least 44 of the state’s 50 delegates, bringing his delegate count to 61, compared to 11 for cruz and 10 for rubio, according to a tally by real clear politics. republicans need 1,237 delegates to win the party nomination. it was trump’s second victory in a row, an outcome that frightens establishment republicans but thrills the “throw the bums out” conservative base of the party that has long been fed up with washington.         the bellicose new york billionaire had created some last minute drama in south carolina after pope francis said on thursday his views on u.s. immigration were “not christian.” trump, who has also advocated a ban on muslim immigrants to counter domestic terror threats, stirred fresh controversy on friday when he told a crowd about a u.s. general who was said to have dipped bullets in pigs’ blood to kill muslim prisoners a century ago. former secretary of state clinton’s victory in the nevada democratic caucuses, meanwhile, could help calm worries among the democratic establishment about the strength of her campaign. her result denied sanders the breakthrough win he had sought in a state with a heavy minority population, but his ability to close a one time double digit polling lead for clinton suggests the democratic nominating race will be long and hard fought. with 90 percent of precincts reporting, the former first lady was leading with 52.6 percent of the vote to sanders’ 47.4 percent.  clinton’s victory gave her fresh momentum as she heads into the next contest in south carolina on feb. 27, where polls show her with a double digit lead largely as a result of heavy support from black voters. “some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,” she told cheering supporters at a victory rally in las vegas. “this is your campaign.”     sanders vowed to fight on and set his sights on the 11 states that vote on “super tuesday,” march 1. he predicted that when democrats gather for their nominating convention in philadelphia in july, “we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states.” “the wind is at our backs,” the vermont senator said. “we have the momentum.” after routing clinton in new hampshire and finishing a strong second in iowa, states with nearly all white populations, sanders had hoped to prove in nevada that he could win over black and hispanic voters and compete nationally as the race moves to states with more diverse populations. but entrance polling in nevada showed he badly lost among black voters, by 76 percent to 22 percent, a bad omen for south carolina and other southern states with big black populations. he did win among hispanics by 53 percent to 45 percent. clinton’s campaign has argued she would assert control of the democratic race once it moved to more diverse states with black and hispanic populations who have traditionally backed clinton and have been slow to warm to sanders.

" texas measures to restrict access for transgender people to bathrooms in schools and public buildings appear doomed after moderate republican powerbrokers blocked the bills and hundreds of businesses opposed them. the so called “bathroom bills” have caused rifts among republicans who control the state’s legislature, leaving no likely path to passage before a 30 day special session wraps on wednesday, analysts and lawmakers said on monday. “the bathroom bill in this session is dead and buried with dirt over its coffin,” said mark jones, a political science professor at rice university in houston. enactment in texas, the most populous republican dominated state, could give momentum to other socially conservative states for additional action on an issue that has become a flashpoint in the u.s. culture wars. but house speaker joe straus, a pro business republican who controls the agenda in the body, has shown little interest in passing a bathroom bill, which he said was not a priority. on monday, opponents of the bills delivered a list with signatures from 50,000 people who opposed a bathroom bill to straus and other prominent republicans, including governor greg abbott. straus’ position was reinforced by a well financed campaign from major corporations including texas based energy companies halliburton (hal.n) and exxonmobil global services (xom.n), which have said the bills were discriminatory and would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. supporters of the legislation, who say it can help protect women and children from sexual assaults, have not given up.  but they acknowledge there is only a slim chance of success, with lawmakers still trying to reach deals on almost all of the 20 priority items set by abbott for the session. opponents are still worried bathroom bill language could be attached as an amendment to another bill, but as of monday afternoon, no such action had been taken. senate bill 3, which made it through the senate and stalled in the house, requires people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. a push for bathroom bills nationally sputtered after north carolina partially repealed such a measure in march after boycotts by athletic organizations and businesses that have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. opponents of the texas measures include global tech giants ibm (ibm.n) and apple (aapl.o), major texas city police chiefs, who contested claims the bills would protect public safety, and the national hockey league’s dallas stars team. republican representative ron simmons, who sponsored a version of the bathroom legislation in the texas house, said the privacy issue at the heart of the bills is supported by a wide majority of republican primary voters. “just because we don’t pass legislation doesn’t mean that the issue is not going to be there,” he said.

" japan s oxford educated crown prince, naruhito, looks set to  bring a more global outlook to the ancient imperial institution while carrying on emperor akihito s legacy of promoting peace and reconciliation with asia when he ascends the throne in 2019. prime minister shinzo abe s cabinet on friday signed off on  an april 30, 2019 date for the octogenarian akihito s retirement   the first abdication by a japanese monarch in two centuries. akihito, who turns 84 on dec. 23, has spent much of his nearly three decades on the throne trying to heal the wounds of a war fought in his father hirohito s name and highlighting the needs of the vulnerable in society. he said in august 2016 that he feared age would make it hard to fulfil his duties.  as an oxford educated scholar and well traveled crown prince, naruhito can draw on a wealth of international experience in carrying out the duties his father pioneered,  said jeffrey kingston, director of asian studies at temple university japan. naruhito, 57, is an advocate for environmental causes, and has taken part in international conferences on clean water.  certainly, on environmental issues, he s very passionate,   said shihoko goto, a senior associate for northeast asia at the washington based wilson center.   he is also very concerned about women s rights ... the idea of empowering women and giving them a position of dignity that goes beyond their place in the traditional world.  naruhito defied palace officials to marry masako owada, a harvard  and oxford educated diplomat who has suffered from stress related illness brought on by the demands of palace life and pressure to bear a royal heir. at one point, he shocked the public with his blunt defense of his wife from criticism and pressure, drawing a rebuke from his younger brother and sorrowful remarks from his father. masako s daughter, 16 year old aiko, cannot inherit the males only throne. a one off law allowing akihito to abdicate was enacted in june, but did not address the controversial issue of female succession   a matter that is becoming increasingly pressing as the royal family shrinks and ages. akihito has only one grandson, 11 year old prince hisahito. how masako, 53, copes with the role of empress will be closely watched.  my hope is that ... she will be able to express herself and embrace some of the things she wants to do and be at the forefront of imperial diplomacy,  the wilson center s goto said.

" the u.s. treasury is reviewing licenses for boeing co and airbus to sell aircraft to iran, department head steven mnuchin said on wednesday, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on iran, syria and north korea. “we will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on iran, syria and north korea to protect american lives,” mnuchin said in testimony to the house ways and means committee. “i can assure you that’s a big focus of mine and i discuss it with the president.” mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on iran’s nuclear activities. his statements followed president donald trump’s middle east trip, in which he called on iran to stop funding “terrorists and militias.” the review suggests that trump’s support for boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. iran has accused washington of supporting terrorism by backing rebels in syria and says halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. mnuchin told the ways and means hearing that sanctions “really work” and were responsible for bringing iran to the negotiating table ahead of the nuclear deal.  for boeing, losing the iranair deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the widebody jetliners are included in the first approved batch of boeing aircraft due for delivery to iranair by 2020. deliveries start in may next year.  boeing said in december it would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year under plans that include iranair’s still tenative order. iranair has agreed to buy 200 u.s. and european passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts.    they include 80 jets from boeing, 100 from airbus and 20 turboprops from franco italian atr. all the aircraft need u.s. licenses because of their reliance on u.s. parts. “boeing continues to follow the lead of the u.s. government with regards to working with iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with iran’s airlines are contingent upon u.s. government approval,” a spokeswoman said by email. an airbus spokesman had no immediate comment. in its first business with the islamic republic since u.s. president donald trump took office vowing a tougher stance on iran in january, boeing last month announced a tentative deal to sell 30 jets to iran aseman airlines, its third largest carrier. boeing said it would apply for licenses for the deal. people involved in the deals say the treasury has so far issued licenses for the main contracts between western suppliers  and iranair, but that many need to be renewed beyond 2020. iranair does not need further approvals to take delivery of the first 70 or so aircraft, they say, though legal experts have said the u.s. treasury can withdraw licenses at any time. about a third of the airbus jets, or some 37, also are due to arrive by 2020, including three already delivered. iranair last week took delivery of four atr turboprops and plans to take the remaining 16 next year.  even with licenses in place, bankers say talks between iran and western banks to fund deliveries of the aircraft have been disrupted by concerns that sanctions could be reintroduced or that banks could be penalized for dealing with iran.

" facing potentially deep budget cuts to u.s. foreign aid, new usaid administrator mark green says he needs to do more with less and prove to president donald trump that development assistance can further his “america first” agenda.  in a first meeting with trump back in january, green made his pitch to the then president elect, drawing from his experience in central america to explain how u.s. funded programs there could help slow the number of immigrants trying to enter the united states illegally. “i said ‘mr. president elect, i believe our development tools can help us achieve just about every one of your strategic priorities,’” green told reuters in his first interview since starting last week as head of the u.s. agency for international development. green had previously worked on u.s supported projects with indigenous mayors in guatemala, honduras and el salvador to improve living conditions “so kids hopefully don’t go 1,000 miles through the worst conditions imaginable and jump the border.” “it works and is a great way to use development,” he said, sitting in a still bare office at usaid headquarters blocks from the white house. green brings a unique resume to the job: a former four term republican congressman from wisconsin who served as u.s. ambassador to tanzania under president george w. bush. in his last job as head of the international republican institute, he helped promote governance and democracy overseas. his time on capitol hill will be key to his new job. in a sign of his good standing there, green’s nomination had support across the political spectrum, as well as among aid groups.   trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of u.s. tax dollars. and now his administration has proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third, which could gut programs across a range of issues including health, governance, gender and education. but u.s. foreign assistance has traditionally garnered bipartisan support in congress, which controls the aid purse strings. green has stronger relations with lawmakers than his  predecessors, who battled congress on funding and objectives. “what’s very different for mark green is that his strongest allies are on the hill,” said scott morris, a senior fellow at the center for global development in washington. “where he faces headwinds are with both the white house and the state department.”  “there is a real potential for conflicts in basic philosophy about what usaid does,” added morris. green is nevertheless sanguine about prospects for a downsized, budget constrained usaid.  “we can’t do everything,” he said. “the resources are limited, so we have to prioritize.” green takes over an agency that has already been through waves of reform in the last decade, adapting to shifting global development patterns featuring deep pocket philanthropic groups, more private sector investment in emerging economies, and the rise of china as a financier in the developing world. new demands have emerged with an unprecedented refugee crisis from wars in syria and iraq, along with famine in africa, and growing violent extremism. “usaid’s humanitarian work is unrivaled, it is mobilization of american generosity, and it will continue,” green said, adding that u.s. assistance should both help in times of crisis and prevent crises from occurring. he wants u.s. foreign assistance to focus on results to show americans that their tax dollars are being put to good use. “i am going to ask every program to show me how it is moving us closer to the day when people can lead themselves,” said green. “if it is not helping, they’re going to have to tell me why.” ",0
" key members of the u.s. congress said friday they had reached a compromise to shift more than $1 billion to try to keep struggling families together, including those with babies born dependant on opioids. the proposal is driven in part by an opioid crisis that threatens thousands of families. the bill would allow mental health, substance abuse and parenting assistance whenever a child is deemed at “imminent risk” of entering foster care. the measure also offers support for relatives who unexpectedly assume responsibility for a child when a parent cannot. under current law, such funds may only be spent after a child enters foster care. a spokesman for the child welfare league of america, john sciamanna, called the proposed change “a landmark…, potentially historic.” the legislation involves more than $1 billion over 10 years. related opioid bills have not included funding. “this bill would make a historic shift in child welfare funding by offering a way for moms and dads to get help and treatment rather than pitching in only after children are removed from home,” said sen. ron wyden, the ranking democrat on the senate finance committee. the bill is a compromise between four powerful members of congress: wyden; the senate finance committee’s republican chair, orrin hatch of utah; the republican chair of the house ways & means committee, kevin brady of texas; and the ranking democrat on ways & means, sander levin of michigan. the plan offers “bipartisan solutions for families and children affected by the opioid addiction crisis,” hatch said in a statement. in december, a reuters investigation revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born opioid dependent and sent home with parents ill prepared to care for them. no more than nine of the 50 u.s. states followed a federal law requiring them to help those newborns, the news agency found. in response to the reuters series, the u.s. department of health and human services asked all states to report by june 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the child abuse prevention and treatment act. in may, the house passed legislation to improve safety planning for children born dependent on opioid drugs. reanne pederson of devils lake, n.d., one of the women portrayed in the reuters series who accidentally smothered her newborn in bed while on drugs, said she was happy to hear about new funding possibilities. “it’s important to me that moms who are struggling with addiction get help,” she said.

" arab states may want their turn at the helm of unesco, but the barbs hurled by egypt at rival candidate qatar during the vote highlights the fractious geopolitics paralyzing the workings of the u.n. cultural agency. the paris based body is known for designating world heritage sites like the ancient city of palmyra in syria and grand canyon national park, but it has struggled for relevance as it becomes increasingly hobbled by regional rivalries and a lack of money.    after two days of a secret ballot that could run until friday, qatar s hamad bin abdulaziz al kawari leads france s audrey azoulay and egyptian hopeful moushira khattab. three other candidates, including from lebanon, trail. the row between qatar and egypt has its roots in the crisis engulfing qatar and its gulf arab neighbors which have severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with doha after accusing it of sponsoring hardline islamist groups, a charge qatar denies.  the dispute has been bubbling for several months, but what we re seeing with the arab candidates is that they are extremely divided. some of the clashes are quite virulent,  said one unesco ambassador. egypt, the arab world s most populous state which has joined the boycott of qatar, has not shied from making its feelings about qatar s unesco bid clear. in an interview with egypt today and retweeted by the foreign ministry, egypt s top diplomat sameh shoukry suggested qatar was using its financial power to influence unesco s 58 member executive council.   it is an organization that is owned by international society and cannot be sold to a particular state or individual,  he was quoted as saying when asked about the qatari candidate s campaign logo  i m not coming empty handed.  a diplomat at qatar s embassy in paris declined to comment. a qatari official at unesco s headquarters also declined immediate comment.     egyptian candidate khattab s first message on twitter in three months was a re tweet of an article in the israeli press entitled  israel bemoans emerging qatari victory in unesco leadership vote.  kawari, the qatari candidate, has so far not reacted to the egyptian allegations, simply tweeting on wednesday:  al kawari tipped to head unesco .   voting lasts over a maximum five rounds. if the two finalists end level, they draw lots.  you get the impression that some are playing politics and competing for the sake of having a post rather than actually wanting to secure the future of the organization,  said a european diplomat.

" president donald trump on thursday signed a resolution that will allow u.s. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti abortion campaigners. “this is a major pro life victory,” said the most powerful republican in the house of representatives, speaker paul ryan, adding that a regulation enacted under democratic former president barack obama had forced states to fund planned parenthood, a national non profit that provides contraception, health screenings, and abortions. under the congressional review act, which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted rules, both the house and senate had passed a resolution killing obama’s regulation that had protected federal grants for clinics in states wanting to block the funding. states such as texas in recent years have kept the grants from going to clinics as part of the country’s longstanding fight over abortion. broadly, many republicans seek to restrict abortion or make it illegal while democrats have fought to keep abortion legal. the resolution had narrowly passed the u.s. congress, with vice president mike pence called to the senate on march 30 to break a tie vote in the chamber, where republicans hold a slim majority. the federal government can never again create a “substantially similar” regulation under the review law. the grants, known as “title x” funds, were already barred from going directly to abortion services but under the now null regulation planned parenthood clinics were assured they could receive money even in the face of state objections.       “allowing states to withhold title x funding from family planning clinics won’t make anyone safer or healthier – it will instead place essential services out of reach,” said diane horvath cosper, a medical doctor and fellow at physicians for reproductive health, adding that for many people the clinics are the only place where they can receive affordable health services such as disease testing.

" donald trump sympathizes with india in its recent escalation of tensions with pakistan and supports skilled immigration, an adviser said on friday, portraying the u.s. presidential hopeful as a friend of india and indian americans. trump, a real estate billionaire, has earned a reputation of hostility toward minorities with proposals such as “extreme vetting” of potential immigrants and building a wall along the mexican border to stop illegal immigration.  the republican nominee has proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult, such as nations faced with islamic militancy. some indian officials worry the united states could become more isolationist under trump, leaving allies like new delhi without the support it has enjoyed under president barack obama against china’s growing regional influence.      shalabh kumar, a chicago based businessman of indian origin tasked by the trump campaign with reaching out to asian americans, said india and the indian american community had nothing to fear from a trump presidency.    there may be only 4 million indian americans but the potential to develop the relationship with their country of origin, a land of 1.3 billion, was huge, kumar told a news conference at a hotel in new delhi that drew a curious audience of about 30 journalists and several tv cameras. “our overarching goal is for the 21st century to be an indian american century   instead of a sino american century,” said kumar, wearing a dark suit and gold rimmed pilot glasses, his white hair swept back.     “mr trump is a businessman   he has no bone in his body, not a drop of blood that is anti immigrant,” kumar said. “he wants to have legal, skills based immigration.” the punjabi born businessman, who emigrated in 1969 and was converted to the republican cause by ronald reagan, also said trump’s determination to keep islamic militants out of the united states played well with his community.  around four in five indians profess the hindu faith, while 14 percent are muslims. hindu nationalist groups, including many indian americans, have applauded trump’s anti muslim comments. “there is a war declared on the free world by islamic terrorists,” kumar said. “we are very happy that india under prime minister narendra modi has taken a very firm stand.” kumar said the republican hindu coalition, a group that he set up last year, would hold a cultural event and charity fundraiser in new jersey on oct. 15 at which trump will deliver a keynote address. half of the gate receipts would go to victims of terrorism, in particular hindu refugees from kashmir and bangladesh.

" a video appearing to show men auctioned as slaves in tripoli has put a long history of abuses against refugees and migrants there on the international agenda, the united nations refugee chief said on thursday. grainy footage broadcast by cnn earlier this month appeared to show an auction of men offered as labourers to libyan buyers for $400, prompting outrage and anger in europe and africa.  but migrants who reach europe by sea have been telling stories of being kidnapped, imprisoned and forced to work for no pay for years.   unfortunately, the horrifying abuses which that video made evident, made obvious to the whole world, are not new,  filippo grandi told reuters in rome.  the merit of that video is that it has now put the issue on the international agenda.  some african countries recalled their ambassadors after the video was broadcast, and the u.n. security council held a special session to discuss the issue after french president emmanuel macron railed against  crimes against humanity  in libya. partly in response to the video, european and african leaders meeting in abidjan on thursday agreed to a plan to cooperate to fight smuggling and seek to ease a human rights disaster in libya.   we ve heard finally authorities   libyan authorities, the international community   talk about practical measures and how to respond to those abuses, to try to stop them, and to try to find solutions for the people affected by them,  grandi said. more than half a million migrants largely from war zones in the middle east and africa have reached europe by sea after setting off from the libyan coast over the past four years, bringing with them numerous tales of abuse.  the international organisation for migration (iom) said in april it had been told of  slave market conditions  in libya and niger. a nigerian man, john osifo, told reuters in may after he was rescued at sea by a humanitarian ship that he had been forced into hard labor, treated like an animal, and beaten with a metal pipe.  for libyans, our black skin is like diamonds,  nicky yong from cameroon said. he watched two men barter for him when he was sold to work as a  builder , he said. after months of negotiations, libya s u.n. backed government in tripoli agreed this week to open a transit center for vulnerable refugees, which will be used to house people before they can be resettled or evacuated to another country. the u.n. told reuters in september it hoped to open the center, where refugees can be protected from smugglers and criminals, early next year.  grandi said that more such facilities will be needed, and that the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) needs to have better access to the detention centers currently being run by the tripoli government.  we will need to create probably more (transit) facilities,  grandi said.  we will also need to have more access... to the detention centers to do the work that we want to do,  grandi said. william lacy swing, head of the iom, told the u.n. security council on tuesday that it was working with partners to try to empty the detention centers in libya. some 30 centers, condemned as inhumane by rights groups, are estimated to hold  15,000 20,000 migrants. hundreds of thousands of other migrants are estimated to be in libya, and many of them are being held by smugglers under lock and key in a country consumed by factional violence since strong man muammar gaddafi was ousted six years ago.

" the u.s. house of representatives passed legislation on wednesday giving congress the power to kill dozens of recently enacted rules in one fell swoop, as republicans charged ahead on their campaign to strip down federal regulations. it was the second time the republican dominated chamber took up legislation blocking “midnight rules,” those rolled out at the close of a president’s term. but the previous bill, introduced in november, had faced a certain veto from president barack obama, a democrat.  on its second day back in session, the house passed the bill on a vote of 238 to 184. the senate is expected to soon consider companion legislation, which could face a harder time because it would need eight votes from democrats.  under a law known as the congressional review act, congress has the right to review regulations for a certain period of time after they are issued. that means any federal regulation approved since may could be voided by the republican led congress once president elect donald trump moves into the white house and can sign off on their disapproval.  it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule, giving senate democrats little power to block a vote with a filibuster. as disapproving each regulation separately could span days, republicans would like to simply vote once to end a variety of new rules on energy, the environment, transportation, banking, finance, education and media ownership. many wall street regulations inspired by the 2007 09 financial crisis have only recently taken final form or are on the cusp of completion, putting them in the disapproval line of fire. that includes two pending rules on payday lending and mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts   both of which have raised republican ire. “because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters, they are much more prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new, incoming administration,” said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte before the vote. “waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for congress or a new administration to check adequately.” cutting down regulation was a near constant theme in republican political campaigns last year, and is part of house speaker paul ryan’s “better way” agenda. the house is also expected to consider soon legislation that would require a congressional vote of approval for any new regulation.

" the u.s. senate voted overwhelmingly on monday to confirm iowa governor terry branstad, one of the u.s. politicians most closely acquainted with china, as president donald trump’s ambassador to beijing. one of branstad’s first challenges will be pushing china to take a harder line against north korea, which said monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate range ballistic missile, although u.s. officials and experts questioned the extent of the country’s progress. branstad assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearing he would take a firm line with the chinese government on issues from north korea to trade disputes and human rights, despite years working closely with chinese officials. branstad said his long ties would help him push beijing on difficult topics, including north korea and thorny trade issues. chinese president xi jinping has called branstad, 70, an “old friend” after decades of dealings on agricultural trade during his long career in politics in iowa, an important farming state. the vote was 82 13, with all 13 of the votes against the republican president’s nominee coming from democrats. speaking in  beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said branstad had worked hard to push relations between chinese and u.s. regions and china hoped he could play an even more positive role in increasing understanding and promoting relations once he takes office. the united states has been trying to persuade china to agree to new sanctions on north korea, which has conducted dozens of missile firings and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016. trump has warned that a “major, major conflict” with north korea is possible over its weapons programs, although u.s. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. branstad’s move to beijing will end his 22 year long tenure as iowa’s governor. the longest serving state governor in u.s. history, branstad is currently serving his sixth nonconsecutive four year term. he is due to be replaced in des moines by lieutenant governor kim reynolds, who would be the state’s first woman governor.

" russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya, who met with donald trump jr. during the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign, wants permission to return to the united states to defend a claim by prosecutors that her client’s company has failed to pay a $6 million settlement in an international money laundering case. veselnitskaya represented prevezon holdings ltd, a russian controlled company, which in may this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the u.s. government to settle a $230 million  russian tax fraud case related to hermitage capital, an american fund that invested in russia.     in a court filing in federal court in manhattan on monday u.s. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on oct. 31, but in a letter on tuesday filed in federal court in manhattan  lawyers for prevezon disagreed. about half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to prevezon that the u.s. government had asked the netherlands to freeze.  the netherlands lifted the hold on the money on october 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by william browder, chief executive of hermitage capital management, the prevezon letter said. in monday’s court filing, u.s. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.  in its letter, prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary u.s. immigration status for veselnitskaya and its owner, denis katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.  veselnitskaya met donald trump jr in new york last year while she was in the united states to represent prevezon in the money laundering case.  trump jr. said in a statement at the time that he and veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of russian children” after russia in 2012 banned adoptions of russian children by americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the u.s. magnitsky act.  the magnitsky act was passed by congress after hermitage capital’s browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving prevezon was uncovered by sergei magnitsky, an auditor for hermitage capital, who died in a russian prison. trump jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described veselnitskaya as a russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father.” ",0

" the white house said on monday that national security adviser michael flynn held just two phone calls with russia’s ambassador to washington, amid reports that flynn’s communications are being scrutinized by u.s. counterintelligence agents. reuters reported earlier this month, citing three sources familiar with the matter, that flynn had held five phone calls with russian ambassador sergei kislyak on dec. 29, the day then president barack obama retaliated for moscow’s interference in the u.s. presidential election. white house press secretary sean spicer said flynn spoke once by telephone to the envoy   he did not give the date   and discussed four topics. those included a conference on syria, a plane crash that killed members of a famous russian military choir, seasonal wishes and setting up a post inauguration call between russian president vladimir putin and president donald trump, he said. on. jan. 13, spicer had said that flynn and kislyak had spoken on dec. 28 and suggested the sole topic had been the logistics of setting up an eventual call between trump and putin. at the time, a trump aide had said the one conversation actually had taken place on dec. 29. on monday, spicer said a second call took place three days ago, apparently just before trump’s inauguration on friday, and dealt with arranging a forthcoming phone call between trump and putin.   two of the sources told reuters earlier this month that the timing of the december calls raised a question about whether flynn had given kislyak any assurances to soothe russian anger over the u.s. sanctions and other moves. the differing accounts of the number of calls could not be immediately reconciled. the wall street journal reported on sunday that flynn’s calls with kislyak on dec. 29, as well as earlier calls he held with russian figures, are under scrutiny as part of probes by the fbi, u.s. intelligence agencies and the treasury department into the extent of russian government contacts with people close to trump. it is unclear whether the inquiry produced any incriminating evidence or if it is continuing, the newspaper said. the journal quoted white house spokeswoman sarah sanders as saying: “we have absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation.” asked whether there were other calls between flynn and “members of the russian government,” spicer replied, “not that i’m aware of. and when i say that, what i’m saying (is) during the transition i asked general flynn whether or not there were any other conversations beyond the ambassador and he said ‘no.’” flynn is a retired army general. a jan. 6 assessment by u.s. intelligence agencies said that putin ordered an effort to help trump’s electoral chances by discrediting democrat hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign.

" a senior u.s. republican filed legislation on wednesday seeking to rein in the white house’s national security council, saying it has grown too large and seeks to play too big a role in foreign policy. representative mac thornberry said his measure would increase oversight of the nsc, capping it at 100 people or allowing it to be larger but subjecting the national security adviser to confirmation by the senate. thornberry estimated the nsc currently has 400 staff. “all of president (barack) obama’s former defense secretaries have complained about micromanagement by the nsc,” thornberry, chairman of the powerful house of representatives armed services committee, said in a statement. “i have personally heard from troops on the frontlines who have received intimidating calls from junior white house staffers. “now we hear reports of nsc staffers running misinformation campaigns targeted at congress and the press,” thornberry said. he was referring to a recent new york times profile in which a deputy national security adviser, ben rhodes, discussed ways the administration had communicated about last year’s iran nuclear deal to the washington press corps. administration officials have dismissed proposals like thornberry’s as political ploys. ned price, a spokesman for the nsc, commented that the white house has already taken steps to trim staff and streamline procedures. thornberry introduced his legislation as an amendment to the national defense authorization act, or ndaa, a must pass annual defense bill. to become law, a version of the ndaa including thornberry’s amendment would have to pass both the house and senate and be signed into law by obama.

" top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass a tax code overhaul this week, with a senate vote as early as tuesday and president donald trump aiming to sign the bill by week’s end. john cornyn, the no. 2 u.s. senate republican, said in an interview on abc’s “this week” that he was “confident” the senate would pass the legislation, “probably on tuesday.” republican representative kevin brady said he believed his party had the votes to pass the bill. “i think we are headed   the american people are headed    for a big win on tuesday,” brady, the house of representatives’  top tax writer, said on fox news’ “sunday morning futures with maria bartiromo.” “we’ve worked hard to make sure that those strange senate rules don’t hang this up in any way,” brady added. “i am confident that’s the case.”  if passed, the bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986 and provide republican lawmakers and trump with their first major legislative victory since they took control of the white house in january in addition to congress. republicans have a slim 52 48 senate majority and cannot lose more than two votes and still pass tax legislation. democrats are unified against the measure, calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit.  last week, on the fence republican senators marco rubio and bob corker said they would support the tax overhaul. senators susan collins and mike lee put out positive statements but did not explicitly say they would vote for it. collins’ office said on sunday that “she’s still reviewing the bill.” republican senator jeff flake cast a vote for an earlier senate version despite deficit concerns, but he is undecided on the final legislation, his office said on sunday.  senators thad cochran and john mccain have been ill in recent weeks and have missed votes. cochran’s office said last week he was expected to vote on the tax bill. mccain, who is battling an aggressive brain tumor, has returned to his home state of arizona and does not expect to be back in washington until january, his office said on sunday. the tax bill is expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion u.s. national debt over 10 years, even after accounting for the economic growth it might spur, according to independent government analyses.  the bill would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and create a 20 percent income tax deduction for owners of “pass through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. it would offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions. the bill would maintain seven individual and family income tax brackets but cut rates. highest earning americans would pay 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent.  most individual provisions, including the lower tax rates, are temporary and would expire, while the corporate rate cut and other business provisions would be permanent. stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations, with wall street’s three major equities indexes closing at record highs on friday. treasury secretary steven mnuchin told cbs news’ “face the nation” on sunday that trump expected to realize his goal of signing the tax bill before christmas. “this is a historic event,” mnuchin said. “people said we wouldn’t get this done; we’re on the verge of getting this done.”  ",0

" democrats on a u.s. of house of representatives panel have asked deutsche bank (dbkgn.de) to provide information on whether any accounts connected to president donald trump have ties to russia, adding another dimension to probes into connections between moscow and trump. democrats on the u.s. house financial services committee said on wednesday they had sent a letter the previous day to deutsche bank chief executive officer john cryan seeking details of internal reviews to determine if trump’s loans for  his real estate business were backed by the russian government.  the congressional inquiry also seeks information about a russian “mirror trading” scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of russia. “congress remains in the dark on whether loans deutsche bank made to president trump were guaranteed by the russian government, or were in any way connected to russia,” the democrats wrote. “it is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews.” the democrats requested the documents from the bank, but cannot compel it to hand over the information. the committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but that would require cooperation from committee republicans who make up the majority of the panel because the party has control of the house. no republicans signed on to the document request. citing media reports, the democrats called for the bank to hand over any documents tied to internal reviews of trump’s personal accounts at the bank. they also said the bank should  state publicly that it had reviewed both the “mirror trading” scheme and trump’s accounts.  mirror trading involved buying stocks, for example, in moscow in rubles, with related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through a bank’s london branch. they also called on the bank to name an independent auditor to verify the results of the reviews, which should be turned over to the committee “as soon as reasonably practicable.” renee calabro, a spokeswoman for deutsche, declined to comment. the house panel request to deutsche comes as trump is mired in controversy over fbi and congressional probes into alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and potential collusion between the moscow and the trump campaign. moscow has denied the allegations, and trump has denied any collusion.

" republican presidential nominee donald trump’s provocative proposals on immigration, trade and other issues have drawn attention and verbal attacks   as well as some praise   well beyond the united states’ shores. here is a sampling. trump and russian president vladimir putin have often praised each other. last december, putin described the new york businessman as “a very flamboyant man, very talented.” trump, who lauded putin in return, also spoke well of him in september, saying at a televised forum with democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton that putin had been a better leader than democratic u.s. president barack obama. some of the strongest criticism of trump from abroad has come from mexican officials because of his verbal attacks on illegal mexican immigrants and his promise to build a wall on the southern border and make mexico pay for it. following talks in mexico city between trump and enrique pena nieto, the mexican president said the american’s policy stances “could represent a huge threat to mexico, and i am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing.” earlier this year, he likened trump to dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini. in april, chinese finance minister lou jiwei called trump “an irrational type” because of the candidate’s proposal that tariffs on imported chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent. “if he were to do this, that would be in violation of the rules set by the world trade organization,” lou said in an interview with the wall street journal. then british prime minister david cameron in may called trump’s initial proposal for a temporary ban on muslim’s entering the united states “very dangerous.” in december, cameron had called trump, potentially the leader of britain’s closest ally, “divisive, stupid and wrong” for calling for the ban.  nigel farage, a politician who played a key role in the successful campaign to get britain out of the european union, lent his support to trump in august, appearing with the candidate at a rally in jackson, mississippi. farage said trump represented the same type of anti establishment movement that he had masterminded in his own country. london’s first muslim mayor, sadiq khan, said in may that trump had an “ignorant view of islam,” referring to trump’s initial proposed ban on muslims. {nl2n18709r] in september, during his first u.s. visit, khan expressed support for clinton. french president francois hollande said in august that a trump victory could make politics more conservative around the world and that the new york businessman made people “feel nauseous.” a trump win could also affect france’s spring 2017 presidential election, said hollande. germany’s european affairs minister, michael roth, said in august that trump’s assertion that chancellor angela merkel’s open door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime was incorrect. roth said it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on “fears, lies and half truths,” given the importance of the u.s. election for the world. in april, the german foreign minister, frank walter steinmeier, criticized trump’s “america first” policy, which the candidate had unveiled in a speech that week. steinmeier said world security could no longer be ensured unilaterally and that international conflicts could only be solved nowadays if heavyweights like the united states and russia and others joined forces. the “america first” stance   which included a portrayal by trump of longtime ally japan as a free rider on security   also came in for a veiled swipe from japan’s ambassador to the united states, kenichiro sasae, in may. without mentioning trump by name, sasae said he did not want to see an isolationist united states. “i want to see the united states to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the united states only,” he said. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra’ad al hussein said on wednesday that the world would be in danger if trump became president. he cited trump’s views on vulnerable communities, including minorities, and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as “deeply unsettling and disturbing.” ",0

" right wing heavyweight xavier bertrand quit france s main conservative party, the republicans, on monday, highlighting the challenges its new chief will face in trying to keep the party together.  the move comes a day after party members overwhelmingly elected laurent wauquiez as a their new boss, following a campaign during which he said president emmanuel macron was too weak on security and immigration.  i don t recognize my political family, so i decided to leave it,  bertrand, a former health minister and current head of hauts de france, a region in northern france, said on france 2 tv station.  bertrand s move underlines growing concern among moderate members of the republicans about the party s direction, after a disastrous presidential campaign that saw its candidate eliminated in the first round.   some have said wauquiez was hauling the party too far to the right and running after the national front, whose leader marine le pen made it to the second round of the presidential election last may.   xavier bertrand obviously considers that he has no place (in the party). it s his choice. i respect it,  wauquiez said on tf1 tv station, in reaction to the news.  i move forward, i look to the future and what i want is to make a new generation emerge, this new right that live to its ideas,  he said.

" north korea’s leader kim jong un said on friday the north will consider the “highest level of hard line countermeasure in history” against the united states in response to u.s. president donald trump’s threat to destroy the north. calling trump “mentally deranged” and his comments “the most ferocious declaration of a war in history,” kim said his u.n. speech on tuesday confirmed pyongyang’s nuclear program has been “the correct path”. “his remarks ... have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path i chose is correct and that it is the one i have to follow to the last,” kim said in the statement carried by the north’s official kcna news agency, promising to make trump “pay dearly for his speech”. trump had warned the north korean leader in his u.n. address on tuesday that the united states, if threatened, would “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people and mocked kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission. it was the u.s. president’s most direct reference to military action so far against the north, which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3. in addition to the nuclear test, north korea has launched dozens of missiles since kim came to power in 2011. two recent ballistic missiles flew over japan as pyongyang advanced toward its goal of creating nuclear warhead tipped missiles that can hit the united states.     kim said trump would face “results beyond his expectation,” without specifying what action north korea would take next. “i will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotard with fire,” kim said in the rare direct statement, referring to trump. he offered more vitriol for trump, saying he was “unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician.” a day after trump’s address, north korea’s foreign minister ri yong ho had likened trump to a “barking dog,” saying his comments were no threat to the north. kim took a page out of ri’s book on friday, saying “a frightened dog barks louder”. “now that trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world.., we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard line countermeasure in history,” kim said.

" the u.n. migration agency called on social media giants on friday to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure west african migrants to libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. the smugglers often use facebook to reach would be migrants with false promises of jobs in europe, international organization for migration (iom) spokesman leonard doyle said. when migrants are tortured, video is also sometimes sent back to their families over whatsapp, as a means of extortion, he said.  we really ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture,  doyle told a geneva news briefing. there were no immediate replies from facebook or whatsapp to requests by reuters for comment. hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to cross the mediterranean to europe since 2014 and 3,091 have died en route this year alone, many after passing through libya. this year, the number of migrants entering europe is 165,000, about 100,000 fewer than all of last year, but the influx has presented a political problem for european countries. iom has been in discussions with social media providers about its concerns, doyle said, adding:  and so far to very little effect. what they say is  please tell us the pages and we will shut them down .  it is not our job to police facebook s pages. facebook should police its own pages,  he said. africa represents a big and expanding market for social media but many people are unemployed and vulnerable, he said.  facebook is pushing out, seeking market share across west africa and pushing out so called free basics, which allows ... a  dumb phone  to get access to facebook. so you are one click from the smuggler, one click from the lies,  he said. social media companies are  giving a turbo charged communications channel to criminals, to smugglers, to traffickers, to exploiters , he added. images broadcast by cnn last month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by libyan traffickers. this sparked anger in europe and africa and highlighted the risks migrants face. doyle called for social media companies to invest in civic minded media outreach and noted that on google, pop up windows appear if a user is looking at pornography images, to warn of danger or criminality. the iom has helped 13,000 migrants to return voluntarily to nigeria, guinea and other countries from libya this year. it  provides them with transport and pocket money and documents their often harrowing testimonies.  doyle said it was currently repatriating 4,000 migrants to niger. switzerland said on friday it was willing to take in up to 80 refugees in libya in need of protection, among 5,000 whom the un refugee agency says are in a precarious position.

" u.s. republican donald trump overhauled his presidential campaign team on wednesday for the second time in less than two months, hiring the head of a conservative news website to bolster his combative image and try to reverse poor opinion poll numbers. trump named steve bannon, head of the breitbart news website, as campaign chief executive officer, a new position. he also promoted senior adviser kellyanne conway to the post of campaign manager.  the latest shake up combines bannon, a conservative flamethrower, with conway, a measured, data driven analyst who might be able to broaden trump’s appeal to women and independent voters.     it offers trump’s team a chance to return to the “let trump be trump” style practiced by former campaign manager corey lewandowski that helped trump, who has never held elective office, win the republican presidential nomination for the nov. 8 election.     lewandowski, ousted in the last campaign reorganization in june, said on cnn that bannon was “a street fighter” like himself. a trump campaign statement announcing the changes touted a bloomberg politics article that branded bannon “the most dangerous political operative in america.”  whether that style will work in the fight against democratic nominee hillary clinton is unclear. trump, a new york real estate developer and former reality tv host, has largely been unable to extend his reach beyond white middle class voters who pack his rallies. trump trails clinton in national opinion polls and in many battleground states, potentially facing a big defeat that could also cost republicans congressional races.         trump, who relishes revving up crowds with off the cuff remarks, drew criticism for comments insulting women, muslims and mexican immigrants during the primary campaign for the republican nomination.  he has since faced a barrage of criticism from republicans over his campaign style and his refusal to stick to a policy message. in particular, he has been rebuked for his prolonged feud with the family of a muslim u.s. army captain who was killed in the iraq war.  on wednesday afternoon, trump received his first intelligence briefing from the office of the director of national intelligence. retired u.s. lieutenant general michael flynn, a trump adviser who attended the briefing at the new york field office of the federal bureau of investigation, said the officials who conducted the two hour session were “absolutely professional” and that it was “a great conversation.” intelligence officials brief the major party u.s. presidential candidates on foreign policy and national security issues but do not disclose ultra sensitive information about ongoing u.s. undercover operations, methods or the identities of intelligence sources. wednesday’s campaign appointments amounted to a demotion for paul manafort, who was brought on as campaign manager in june to bring a more professional touch to trump’s campaign but has struggled to get the businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.     clinton, a former secretary of state who has called trump temperamentally unsuited for the white house, said staff shake ups did nothing to change the candidate and his rhetoric. “donald trump has shown us who he is, he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign, they can make him read new words from a teleprompter, but he is still the same man who insults gold star families, demeans women, mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about isis than our generals,” she told a rally in ohio. conway and bannon may prove to be opposing forces in trump’s campaign. conway is analytical and numbers driven and often offers a more pragmatic approach to winning campaigns. she is expected to travel with trump. bannon likes to push the limits of polite conversation and revels in taking the fight up a notch, strategists say. “for steve and i, we also recognize that we are different when we say we have different styles, but we have one vision,” conway told reporters.  bannon was a key figure in producing and promoting a movie called “clinton cash” that accused bill and hillary clinton of doing favors for high dollar donors to the clinton foundation charity, a theme that trump has been touching on in his campaign speeches. “my guess is bannon will be a bull in a china shop and conway will be focused on messaging and paid media,” said republican strategist matt mackowiak. the appointment of bannon suggested trump was aiming not to tone down his aggressive style but to be more disciplined in emphasizing themes that resonate strongly with the voters he is trying to court, such as his tough stance against illegal immigration and withering personal criticism of clinton. “i am who i am, i don’t want to change,” trump told wisconsin television station wktb on tuesday. “if you start pivoting, you’re not being honest with people.” the shift to new leadership may not be a good sign at this stage of a campaign, but some republican strategists said it was not too late for trump. “i’ve thought for a while that they’ve needed more smart, senior people and it looks like they just got them,” said republican strategist charlie black. “it’s only the middle of august. this race is going to be close in the end, but he does need to tighten up his performance.” conway told fox news she was advising trump to take “his case directly to the people.” “with donald trump, he is still his own best messenger because people see him as very authentic.”. she has worked to improve the republican party’s standing with women voters and to push back on democratic accusations that republicans are waging a “war on women.”  manafort drew unwelcome attention this week when the new york times reported his name was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a ukrainian political party with close ties to russia. manafort denied any impropriety on monday. the current realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton six percentage points ahead of trump, at 47.2 percent to his 41.2 percent.

" when u.s. president donald trump announced a review last week of tough obama era vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency standards, he proclaimed that the “assault on the american auto industry is over.” but rules set by the environmental protection agency may take a backseat to consumers demanding vehicles that guzzle less gas and automakers having to meet tougher standards if they want to export cars overseas, according to auto industry analysts.  in the end, u.s. carmakers may just gain a few more years to meet the more stringent targets that former president barack obama’s administration negotiated with the companies in 2012, analysts said. if europe and china continue to toughen their emissions standards, “the u.s. might become an outlier,” american axle president mike simonte told reuters on thursday.  trump’s move was widely seen leading to a rollback or loosening of more stringent targets, which would slash vehicle exhaust emissions while effectively doubling average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.  automakers have argued the rules for 2022 2025 are too expensive and could cost american jobs, so the trump administration’s review was seen as a win for them. on a conference call thursday with investors, bob shanks, ford motor co’s chief financial officer, said, “we are not seeking a rollback in any way. we just want to have a conversation around the levels we want to achieve.” despite what the epa may want, california and nine other states in the zero emission vehicle program — eight in the northeast, plus oregon — are expected to move ahead on friday with the previously established targets. those states account for nearly 30 percent of u.s. auto sales. the potential divide with the rest of the country could create a “two tiered environment with two sets of regulations,” said mark wakefield, managing director of alixpartners’ automotive practice. this “could drive costs higher if automakers have to build two versions of the same vehicle to meet the two different standards.” the alliance of automobile manufacturers, a trade group that sued to overturn the obama era rules on behalf of several big automakers, wrote the white house on thursday urging talks to begin quickly with california to ensure that national standards remain in place.  “automakers seek certainty, predictability and rationality – over time – from the regulatory process,” the group’s ceo mitch bainwol wrote.     kristin dziczek, director of the center for automotive research’s labor and industry group, said u.s. automakers could find it hard to export cars to markets such as china and europe with tougher regulatory regimes if the u.s. targets were rescinded. “i don’t think we’re going to see a rollback,” she said. “at most, i think we may see a slowing of the timetable” for implementing the tougher standards. alixpartners’ wakefield said if china, the world’s largest market, continues pushing electric vehicles while america backpedals, it could lead to “some movement of investment from the u.s. to china, especially as the latter market continues to grow.” general motors co and fiat chrysler automobiles nv referred reuters to public comments made by the industry’s lobbying group, the alliance of automobile manufacturers. epa administrator scott pruitt, a climate change skeptic, said the obama administration estimated it would cost $200 billion over 13 years to comply with stricter standards, which he believes will lead to higher prices for consumers and jobs leaving the country.     morgan stanley analyst adam jonas said the auto industry expected to miss the 2022 2025 targets regardless of who occupied the white house, but he believes the epa’s recent move may carry relatively little weight. “of all the things that are likely to drive fuel economy, i would rank the epa a distant third on the list, behind consumer preferences and the direction of technology,” he said. united auto workers union president dennis williams said while around 60 percent of u.s. auto sales are currently trucks and suvs, consumers value fuel economy improvements for those vehicles. “the automakers shouldn’t make the mistake of sliding backward,” williams said. “we’re here to protect our (union) members, but we understand that in doing so we also have to look at the future.” ",0

" the united states stopped election support for cambodia with a promise of more  concrete steps  and the european union threatened vital trade preferences after the main opposition party to prime minister hun sen was banned. but china said it supported cambodia in following its own path, making no criticism of the government led by the former khmer rouge commander who is one of beijing s most important allies in southeast asia after more than three decades in power. the ban on the cambodia national rescue party (cnrp), decreed by the supreme court at the government s request, followed the arrest of its leader for treason. kem sokha is accused of plotting to take power with american help. hun sen s critics called the cnrp dissolution an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy. western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system following decades of war.  on current course, next year s election will not be legitimate, free or fair,  a white house statement said, promising to take  concrete steps . the first of those was to end support for the cambodian national election committee ahead of the 2018 election, it said. in april, the u.s. embassy announced a $1.8 million grant to assist local elections in 2017 and next year s general election. in brussels, an eu spokesman said the election could not be legitimate without the opposition and noted that respect for human rights was a prerequisite for cambodia s access to eu trade preferences under its  everything but arms scheme.  that scheme, giving tariff free access, and similar trade preferences in the united states have helped cambodia build a garment industry on low cost labor. between them, eu and u.s. markets take some 60 percent of cambodia s exports.  i am very worried after the dissolution of the party,  factory sewer heng kheang, 35, said as other colleagues nodded in agreement at their lunch break.  workers will be most affected, more than the rich.   in a symbolic step, the u.s. senate passed a resolution calling on the treasury and state departments to consider placing cambodian officials implicated in abuses on a watch list for asset freezes and travel bans. huy vannak, undersecretary of state at cambodia s interior ministry who is close to hun sen, said the u.s. position was  made without consideration to the evidence and court hearing .  we hope that the u.s. will consider the overall bilateral relations with cambodia and continue to collaborate with common interests of both countries,  he said. in beijing, foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a news briefing that china supported cambodia in pursuing its own development path. china is by far the biggest single donor to cambodia and its biggest investor. hun sen has been in a deepening war of words with the u.s. embassy and state department over a crackdown on his critics, but at the weekend posed with u.s. president donald trump at a regional summit and praised his policies of non interference. the fact that the threat of action came from the white house gave it greater weight than previous statements from the state department calling for the release of kem sokha. so far, western countries have shown little appetite for sanctions and the opposition itself has shied away from calling for steps to restrict garment exports because of the hundreds of thousands of workers who depend on them. but leaders of the cnrp now say they support some sanctions.  sanctions are the best leverage for negotiation for free, fair and inclusive elections,  said mu sochua, a deputy to cnrp leader kem sokha, who fled cambodia fearing arrest. there have been no protests over the opposition party ban and many people in the capital, phnom penh, said they were afraid to speak out. there were no party members at the cnrp headquarters on friday, only security guards.  they are worried about their safety,  said guard chin savy. the central market was full of its usual bustle and one man told reuters he was glad to see the back of the opposition.  hun sen has a lot of help from china. if he just depended on the u.s., we wouldn t be anywhere,  said khen kong, 69, a businessman. in a televised address on thursday, hun sen told cambodians the election would go ahead  as normal  and appealed to politicians from the cnrp who had not been banned to join his cambodian people s party. u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein expressed grave concern about the conduct of credible elections next year as well as a clampdown on civil rights groups and independent media.

" the trump administration plans to admit up to 45,000 refugees to the united states in the fiscal year starting oct. 1, a former u.s. official said on tuesday, a ceiling that would keep admissions to their lowest level in over a decade. the white house settled on the figure after a contentious debate between officials who wanted a lower ceiling and those who wanted a higher one, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. on one side of the debate were officials who tended to look at the issue through a domestic political prism given president donald trump’s focus on curbing immigration during the 2016 u.s.  presidential campaign.  on the other were foreign policy experts who argued that taking refugees into the united states is vital to ensure other nations keep their borders open. the plan to set the cap at 45,000 was earlier reported by the wall street journal newspaper. the former official, who favored a higher number, said the decision will undermine the u.s. ability to persuade nations such as jordan, turkey and lebanon that have accepted huge flows of syrian refugees to keep admitting them as well as to convince donor nations to keep up financial contributions for refugees. “we have no standing to play that role when we cut our own humanitarian assistance and when we are halving our refugee admissions,” said the former official. in his two travel ban executive orders, trump directed the united states to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal 2017 year ending sept. 30, less than half the 110,000 president barack obama authorized. in part because of court challenges to those orders, the united states ultimately accepted more than 50,000 refugees during the current fiscal year. according to state department data, the united states took in 51,392 refugees through august. if the united states accepts 45,000 in fiscal 2018, it would be the lowest level admitted since fiscal 2006, when it took in 41,223, according to state department data. a state department spokesman declined comment on the 45,000 figure, saying only that secretary of state rex tillerson and acting secretary of homeland security elaine duke would consult congress on wednesday. “each year, the president makes an annual determination, after appropriate consultation with congress, regarding the refugee admissions ceiling for the following fiscal year. secretary tillerson and dhs acting secretary duke will consult with congress tomorrow,” he said.",0
" japanese defence minister gen nakatani said on saturday that japan and south korea agreed to expand an emergency communication system between their defense ministries, including adding a new direct line between defense ministers. tensions have been high in the region since early january when north korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. it has followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, most recently a failed launch on tuesday. “what it means is that we will make use of phones for emergency communication, when security related emergencies such as a missile launch occur, and communication and coordination between the defense authorities of the two countries are needed,” nakatani told reporters at the shangri la dialogue, a regional security forum in singapore. he said such emergency phone lines would be expanded to include a new direct link between the two countries’ defense ministers.  nakatani said talks would continue on sharing and safeguarding sensitive information on pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programs.  under the framework, south korea would pass relevant information to the united states, with which seoul already has a legally binding pact to share and safeguard intelligence called general security of military information agreement (gsomia). the united states would then pass the information on to japan. it would work similarly the other way around since the united states has also signed a gsomia with japan.  some south koreans have voiced concerns about signing a security pact with japan, their one time colonial ruler.  besides historical issues stemming from japan’s annexation of the korean peninsula that ended in 1945, ties have been chilled by a long running territorial dispute over a group of tiny islets.

" several countries, the united nations and journalist groups are demanding the release of reuters reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo from detention in myanmar.  the reporters were arrested on dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of yangon. they had worked on stories about a military crackdown in rakhine state, scene of around 650,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh since august. myanmar s ministry of information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. it said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the british colonial era official secrets act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged. their exact whereabouts are not known.  we and their families continue to be denied access to them or to the most basic information about their well being and whereabouts,  reuters president and editor in chief stephen j. adler said in a statement calling for their immediate release.      wa lone and kyaw soe oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,  he said. here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups and press freedom advocates around the world:   two u.n. human rights experts called on thursday for myanmar to release the two reporters, saying it was putting myanmar on a dangerous path by using the official secrets act to criminalize journalism.  journalism is not a crime. these detentions are another way for the government to censor information about the military s role in rakhine state and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place,  said yanghee lee and david kaye, who are the u.n. special rapporteur on myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively.   a spokeswoman for norway s ministry of foreign affairs, said on wednesday:  norway expects the myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights and to release the journalists as quickly as possible.     human rights watch said the detentions appeared to be  aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the rohingya.  brad adams, the group s asia director, said,  their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues.     in washington, the leading democrat on the senate foreign relations committee called for their immediate release.  this is outrageous,  said senator ben cardin.  it just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule.    u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said last week the united states was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  on tuesday, the state department reiterated the u.s. demand for the reporters  immediate release.   republican thom tillis and democrat chris coons, leaders of the u.s. senate human rights caucus, said they were  gravely concerned  about the reporters  arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the rohingya. democratic congressman ted lieu, a member of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee, called the arrests  outrageous and a direct attack on press freedom.    japanese foreign minister taro kano said in response to a question from a reuters reporter on tuesday,  freedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. the japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.  tokyo based human rights now  called on japan on wednesday to take a stronger stance.    the european union urged myanmar on monday to release the reporters  as quickly as possible.  a spokeswoman for eu  foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said,  freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.    u.n. secretary general antonio guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and press freedom in myanmar.  it is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country,  he said.    britain, holland, canada and sweden have demanded the release of the reuters reporters. australia has expressed concern and bangladesh has denounced the arrests.    vijay nambiar, former special adviser on myanmar to the u.n. secretary general, said in a statement to reuters on monday that the detentions had caused  widespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of myanmar, already under stress as a result of its handling of the rakhine crisis.    president of the european parliament antonio tajani called on myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters.   the international commission of jurists (icj) called on myanmar to immediately disclose the reporters  whereabouts.  all detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,  frederick rawski, icj s asia pacific regional director, said on monday.   the committee to protect journalists said the arrests were  having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance .   reporters without borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were  completely spurious .   advocacy group fortify rights demanded myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the reuters journalists.    myanmar s irrawaddy online news site called on dec. 14 for the journalists  release in an editorial headlined  the crackdown on the media must stop.  it said  it is an outrage to see the ministry of information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed   as police normally do to criminals   on its website soon after the detention. it is chilling to see that moi has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.    the southeast asian press alliance said the journalists were  only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the rohingya conflict.     the protection committee for myanmar journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .    the foreign correspondents  club of myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about press freedom in myanmar.    the foreign correspondents  club in thailand, foreign correspondents  association of the philippines, jakarta foreign correspondents  club and foreign correspondents  club of hong kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

" cambodia s main opposition party was blocked from holding a memorial ceremony on wednesday for victims of a 1997 grenade attack on a political rally, with tension running high after the arrest of its leader last week. the u.s. embassy urged its citizens to exercise caution after prime minister hun sen s government accused the united states of conspiring with opposition leader kem sokha, who has been charged with treason. potentially further fanning anti american sentiment, the embassy announced it had stopped issuing visas for some cambodian foreign ministry officials. kem sokha s cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) had planned to hold a ceremony at a memorial in the capital, phnom penh, to mark an attack in which at least 16 people were killed at a rally on march 30, 1997 organized by former opposition leader sam rainsy. similar memorials have been permitted in previous years around the pchum ben festival, when cambodians pay respects to deceased ancestors.  we tried to hold the ceremony at the memorial and we were stopped,  mu sochua, one of the cnrp s deputy presidents, told reuters.  we don t want to confront the authorities but we want to show that these are signs of intimidation,  she said, adding that the ceremony was then moved to a nearby pagoda. phnom penh s city hall spokesman met measpheakdey said the pagoda was the right place for the ceremony and the party s request to do it at the monument had been denied. opponents of hun sen accuse him of arresting kem sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year in which he could face the toughest electoral challenge of more than 30 years in power. the united states and western countries have called for kem sokha s release, drawing further anti american rhetoric from the government. the u.s. embassy said it had no specific warnings of security issues but urged u.s. citizens to show caution. the embassy announced it had stopped issuing visas to some senior foreign ministry officials in a separate dispute over cambodia s refusal to continue accepting cambodian citizens the united states wants to deport china, cambodia s biggest donor and investor by far, has stood by hun sen s government.   chinese friends are like a strong back that continues to help cambodia in every circumstance so that no foreign country can break it up,  hun sen said on his facebook page on wednesday after returning from a trip to china.

" russia is ready to do its part to fully restore ties with washington following the election of businessman donald trump as the next u.s. president, russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday. trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored rival hillary clinton in tuesday’s presidential election, ending eight years of democratic rule and sending the united states on a new, uncertain path. among those uncertainties will be the trump administration’s future relations with russia. ties between washington and moscow have become increasingly strained over the conflicts in ukraine and syria, and allegations of russian cyber attacks featured in the u.s. election campaign. “we heard the campaign statements of the future u.s. presidential candidate about the restoration of relations between russia and the united states,” putin said on wednesday at a ceremony to receive credentials from new foreign ambassadors. “it is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return russian and american relations to a stable path of development,” he added. “this would be good for both the russian and american people and have a positive impact on the climate of world affairs.” trump is widely viewed as friendly to the kremlin and putin has said previously his future counterpart is a talented and colorful character. the kremlin said earlier on wednesday russia hoped coordination with the united states over the war in syria, where the two countries back opposing sides, would improve under the new u.s. president.

" donald trump’s presidential campaign is buying commercial time on a tv station in west palm beach, florida, taking on opponents in a paid media battle that the republican front runner has largely avoided so far. the march 15 nominating contest in florida, a winner take all vote, is seen as one of the last chances to slow trump’s momentum after a string of victories on super tuesday. one superpac allied with rival presidential candidate marco rubio has already shelled out millions in the state.  the race has become a fight between trump and anti trump interests, which should drive new demand for ads, said mark egan, chief client officer of maxus americas, a media agency owned by groupm. “the big war really starts now,” he said.the billionaire candidate to date has relied heavily on free air time and twitter, largely ignoring television. on thursday he began purchasing commercial slots for the first time on west palm beach station wptv, said lloyd bucher, vice president and general manager of the station, an nbc affiliate. he declined to discuss the amount.  superpacs that oppose trump are gearing up in the state. conservative solutions, a superpac allied with rubio, has aired or distributed $4.8 million worth of ads and direct mail in florida that explicitly opposes trump, according to federal election commission data from friday through tuesday. that is the most spent by a candidate allied superpac against trump in a single state so far. tv stations in states with upcoming primaries are fielding more inquiries from outside groups opposing trump, said steve lanzano, president and ceo of tvb, a trade body for television broadcasters.  “you are seeing a lot more superpacs coming out of the woodwork,” he said. election years typically provide windfalls for local tv stations as candidates blanket airwaves. ad spending in the weeks leading up to the south carolina primary was four times the level of 2012, lanzano said.  some media investors and analysts are concerned trump may continue to rely mostly on free media exposure, which would hurt the revenues expected for local stations. lanzano believes the trump campaign will start buying more time to fight back against the attacks coming his way. “i think he is going to spend a lot of money on advertising ultimately,” lanzano said. “he is going to get bombarded.”  (reporting by lisa richwine in los angeles, jessica toonkel in hollywood, florida, and grant smith in washington; editing by g crosse, peter henderson and andrew hay) this article was funded in part by sap. it was independently created by the reuters editorial staff. sap had no editorial involvement in its creation or production.",0
" the assistant to a billionaire real estate developer from macau accused of engaging in a scheme to pay bribes to a former united nations general assembly president is in plea talks, his lawyer said on tuesday. the negotiations involving jeff yin, who was arrested along with billionaire ng lap seng in 2015, were disclosed in a letter filed in manhattan federal court by his attorney, who said prosecutors had extended him a plea offer. the lawyer, sabrina shroff, sought to extend court deadlines so that yin, 31, could consider the plea offer, which “is complex and involves civil tax assessments and liabilities,” according to her letter. the plea talks come ahead of a jury trial scheduled for may 15, in which yin and his boss could face substantial prison time if convicted. it was unclear what charges yin would have to plead guilty to if he accepted the offer. he had faced bribery, money laundering and tax related charges, and was also accused of violating the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. shroff declined comment. the u.s. attorney’s office in manhattan, which is pursuing the case, also declined comment. ng, who was once linked to a campaign fundraising investigation during former u.s. president bill clinton’s administration, is one of seven individuals charged since october 2015 in the u.n. related probe. prosecutors accuse ng and yin of paying more than $500,000 in bribes to john ashe, a former u.n. ambassador from antigua and barbuda who served as general assembly president from 2013 to 2014. ashe died in june awaiting trial. the indictment said ng and yin also paid bribes to francis lorenzo, a then deputy u.n. ambassador from the dominican republic who pleaded guilty in march 2016 to bribery and money laundering charges as part of a deal to cooperate in the probe. the main goal of the bribes, according to the indictment, was to have both ambassadors take steps to help obtain united nations’ support for a multibillion dollar u.n. backed conference center in macau that sun kian ip group would develop. yin, a u.s. citizen who currently lives in california, also faces charges for taking steps to evade paying income taxes and helping lorenzo conceal portions of his income from u.s. tax authorities. ng, the founder of macau based real estate developer sun kian ip group, has denied wrongdoing. a lawyer for ng declined to comment.

" seventeen winters ago, the european union offered a very cold shoulder to a chancellor who brought austria s far right into government, and some eu leaders even spoke of boycotting tyrolean ski resorts in protest. on monday, the strong chance sebastian kurz s center right will invite the freedom party back into a vienna coalition raised barely a murmur in brussels. that said something about how the fpo has moved from its neo nazi past and a lot about how the rest of europe has shifted rightward, especially on immigration. an austrian government led by a man who campaigned on tough border policies and featuring the fpo would, two years ago, have been  an earthquake  for europe, a senior eu official said. now, following the crisis of 2015 16 in which over a million refugees and others came by sea to greece and italy, often then reaching germany via austria, critics of open doors have shifted europe their way. said another brussels insider:  they ve built the theater that we are all playing in now.  a hard nosed deal with turkey to hold back syrian refugees, tougher action on detaining and deporting failed asylum seekers, scaling back rescue boats and cooperation with libyan forces  have contributed to a substantial fall in new arrivals. in germany, where fellow travelers of the fpo damaged chancellor angela merkel in an election last month, her bold welcome for refugees in 2015 has given way to support for ramped up border defenses. congratulating the 31 year old kurz on sunday s election victory, european commission president jean claude juncker alluded to concern about a eurosceptic government in vienna. the brussels chief executive wished him success in forming a  stable, pro european government . juncker s spokesman would not say that the commission was pressing kurz to shun the fpo, as eu leaders did when chancellor wolfgang schuessel formed a coalition with the party then led by joerg haider in 2000. that february, nearly 18 years ago, juncker as prime minister of luxembourg was among the 14 eu leaders who barely spoke to schuessel or his ministers for six months and later revised eu treaties to create powers to suspend renegade member states. there were harsh words. belgium s foreign minister   father of its current premier charles michel   called on people not to take winter holidays in austria. yet current belgian foreign minister didier reynders was one of many attending an eu meeting who politely congratulated their absent young austrian colleague and said they looked forward to working with his new government. none so much as mentioned those suspension powers which the eu gave itself after their failure to change schuessel s mind.  fellow ministers chorused on kurz s pro eu credentials. his party colleague johannes hahn, who holds austria s seat on juncker s commission said that whatever government kurz formed would have  a very pro european agenda because all the major political parties are very much committed to the european union . that reflects a shift in the fpo under heinz christian strache. he has toned down hostility to the eu and distanced the party from anti semitism while criticizing islam. it took the far left leader in the european parliament to offer anything but a mild reaction. gabi zimmer said the vote should  strike fear into everyone  and accused kurz of espousing  bigotry and prejudices  to beat a party led by a  neo nazi .  but kurz faces a europe very different from the one that  ostracized schuessel. power has shifted to fellow conservatives, compared to 2000, when governments including those of germany, france, britain and italy were in the hands of the left. eu enlargement to the ex communist east has brought in many more leaders, such as in poland and hungary, who are open in their hostility to immigration, especially by muslims. kurz won a particularly warm tribute from his hungarian counterpart. and more governments   french, dutch, nordic and now german   face the problem schuessel had of a popular far right party. that has contributed to a reluctance to criticize eu peers over strategies to contain such insurgencies   though leaders will be looking to kurz to rein in the fpo, as they did when they needed to justify letting schuessel back into their fold. that lesson, of having to climb down after rushing to the rhetorical barricades but failing to make schuessel budge, shows up today in a hesitation to suspend hungary or poland for failings on democratic values. as one eu official put it:  austria in 2000 showed us how not to go in without an exit strategy.

" u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley on thursday slammed a bid by russia to shield iran from inspections by the united nations nuclear watchdog relating to a specific section of a landmark 2015 deal restricting tehran s nuclear activities. iran agreed to the nuclear deal with six major powers in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. compliance with the nuclear restrictions is being verified by the vienna based international atomic energy agency. haley has infuriated iran by saying the iaea should widen inspections to include military sites, but diplomats say russia has been trying to restrict the agency s role by arguing it has no authority to police a broadly worded section of the deal.   if the iran nuclear deal is to have any meaning, the parties must have a common understanding of its terms,  haley said in a statement.  it appears that some countries are attempting to shield iran from even more inspections. without inspections, the iran deal is an empty promise.  haley issued the statement in response to iaea director general yukiya amano telling reuters that major powers needed to clarify the disputed section of the deal, which relates to technology that could be used to develop an atom bomb.[nl8n1m74ej] that section bans  activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device.  it lists examples such as using computer models that simulate a nuclear bomb, or designing multi point, explosive detonation systems. unlike many other parts of the deal, the provision, known as section t, makes no mention of the iaea or specifics of how it will be verified. russia says that means the iaea has no authority over it. western powers and the agency disagree. u.s. president donald trump has called the iran nuclear deal   reached by predecessor barack obama    an embarrassment to the united states.   trump has hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for review by a mid october deadline, in which case the u.s. congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the accord, known officially as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa).

" republicans in the u.s. house of representatives said on friday  they would advance legislation next year to chop individual and corporate u.s. tax rates. the tax plan, unveiled by house speaker paul ryan and other republican lawmakers at the u.s. capitol, is the sixth and final plank of a conservative policy agenda being rolled out in an effort to unify republicans after a divisive primary campaign for the party’s presidential nominee. ryan, the highest ranking elected republican, said the proposal would provide a clear direction for u.s. economic leadership and was needed amid global uncertainty that was exemplified by the british vote to leave the european union. “for all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong, powerful, confident, american economic leadership is in need, and this does that,” he said. washington has been unable to summon the political will to reform the loophole riddled tax code for nearly three decades. overhauling the code has long been a goal of ryan, a self described policy wonk. he was considered the republican party’s leading voice on taxes and budgets before he ascended to the job of speaker last year. but the labor powerhouse afl cio scorned the republican blueprint as similar to a tax cutting proposal made last year by presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump, who ryan recently endorsed. ryan and trump “have striking resemblance   both tax plans benefit the wealthy & corps a lot,” the afl cio said on twitter.  trump’s ideas about taxes have appeared contradictory at times. he said in may he is open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off prior proposals to reduce taxes on all americans and corporations by slashing rates even more deeply than ryan and house republicans would. democrats, including presidential front runner hillary clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest americans for years. house democratic leader nancy pelosi criticized the republican plan as “massive tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires on the backs of hard working american families.” the plan would consolidate the current seven tax brackets for individuals to three, and lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, higher than the 25 percent that ryan proposed when he chaired the house budget committee.  ryan said the goal was to make things so simple the average american could do their taxes on a postcard. the plan would lead to a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on small business income. it would also lower the top u.s. corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world, to 20 percent, as well as shift to a “territorial” style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of american companies abroad from u.s. taxation. the blueprint also calls for overhauling the tax collecting internal revenue service, an idea that animates many conservatives who have called for its abolition.

" france won t let the official base of the european union s parliament be moved from strasbourg to brussels, the country s european affairs minister nathalie loiseau said on sunday.  strasbourg must remain the seat of european democracy. it s also the symbol of franco german reconciliation,  she said on france 3 television.  it is often said that europe comes down to the brussels bubble. europe needs to be closer to its regions,  she added. members of the european parliament (meps) convene in strasbourg for one week every month and in brussels for the remainder. the monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($124 million) a year, eu auditors say. critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because france would have vetoed any attempt to make the required amendment to the eu treaty. some lawmakers had hoped the election victory of pro eu president emmanuel macron could help plans to close the base in the french city. on brexit negotiations, loiseau said there were  positive noises  ahead of a summit in brussels set to decide whether enough progress has been made on the first phase of negotiations to move on to talks about a post brexit trade relationship. but she said france remained vigilant on the issue of the land border with ireland.  it s a red line which was drawn by the 27 member states and by the united kingdom, accepted by them,  she said. loiseau also said france was waiting for conclusions from the eurostat statistics agency on whether the reimbursements it is due to make to companies after a dividend tax was canceled by courts should be all included in its 2017 accounts. that would scupper the french government s plans to bring its budget deficit below the eu mandated 3 percent in 2017.  in all logic, there is no reason to attribute the whole 10 billion euros to 2017. that s what we explained, we are waiting for eurostat answers,  she said. loiseau, a career diplomat, also said she was disappointed by germany s decision to vote in favor of clearing the use of weedkiller glyphosate for the next five years earlier this week.

" u.s. president barack obama said on friday a long delayed rule requiring the financial industry to identify the real owners of companies will help fight corruption and tax evasion and boost the economy. his administration on friday issued the customer due diligence rule in the works since 2012 and proposed legislation meant to stop prevent criminals from using shell companies to evade taxes, launder money, and finance terror.  “these actions are going to make a difference,” obama told reporters. he said they would help the administration to do a better job of tracking financial flows and making sure companies are “paying the taxes they owe rather than using shell corporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that ordinary americans are doing every day.” obama also called on congress to pass legislation that requires all companies formed in the united states to report information to the financial crimes enforcement network at the treasury department.   “that’s going to help law enforcement better investigate and prevent financial crimes,” obama told reporters. obama also urged congress to raise the federal minimum wage, pass new trade agreements, and simplify the tax code.  “only congress can fully close the loopholes” that wealthy individuals or corporations can take advantage of, obama said. he singled out senator rand paul, a republican and libertarian, who in years past has single handedly blocked tax treaties or treaty updates between the united states and spain, japan, britain, and other countries. paul has been “a little quirky on this issue,” obama said, and urged him “to stop blocking the implementation of tax treaties.”  paul’s office did not immediately comment.

" a u.s. judge on wednesday said he was “very much inclined” to maintain a court order that blocks president donald trump’s administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to so called sanctuary cities. at a hearing in san francisco federal court, u.s. district judge william orrick iii said a recent memo from the justice department that appeared to narrow the scope of trump’s executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction. trump issued the order in january directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities. sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws. dozens of local governments and cities, including new york, los angeles and chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement. the trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. the republican president’s moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court.  after trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year, santa clara county   which includes the city of san jose and several smaller silicon valley communities   sued, saying it was unconstitutional. san francisco filed a similar lawsuit. in a ruling in april, orrick said trump’s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. attorney general jeff sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of trump’s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. in court on wednesday, deputy assistant attorney general brett shumate said the sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for santa clara county and san francisco, so the injunction was no longer needed. but orrick said an injunction was still necessary because trump could always order sessions to issue new, broader guidance. “the attorney general still has the ability to change that memo,” orrick said. the judge said he would also likely reject a justice department request to dismiss other claims by santa clara and san francisco.

" officials from so called sanctuary cities met in new york on tuesday to discuss their response to threats from the trump administration to cut off some funding to cities and states that fail to assist federal authorities in arresting illegal immigrants. attorney general jeff sessions threatened on monday to strip u.s. justice department grants from cities and other local governments that choose to shield illegal immigrants from  deportation efforts under president donald trump. his remarks were aimed at dozens of cities and other local governments, including new york, los angeles and chicago, that have joined a growing “sanctuary” movement aimed at protecting immigrant communities. tuesday’s meeting in new york marked the second straight day of brainstorming on the immigration issue by leaders of some of america’s biggest urban centers. public officials, liberal activists and academics from around the country shared information on a host of issues. topics discussed included when and how to challenge requests from immigration and customs enforcement (ice) to hold illegal immigrants under arrest, for separate local offenses. attendees came from california, texas, wisconsin, pennsylvania, connecticut, washington state and elsewhere. sanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. sanctuary city is not an official designation. federal records show the justice department doled out $1 billion to state governments and $430 million to nonprofits in 2016, but only $136 million directly to cities and counties. crime is generally lower in sanctuary counties, according to a study presented by university of california san diego assistant professor tom wong. he said the findings echoed those of law enforcement officials themselves, since they have found they are more effective when they can focus on day to day policing instead of immigration enforcement. chicago city council member carlos ramirez rosa said that although his city is a sanctuary jurisdiction, immigration agents raided a home there on monday where eight people, including three children, were sleeping. the agents shot and wounded felix torres, though he was not the person agents were seeking, ramirez rosa said.  “this guns blazing raid ... is exactly why my city should refuse to comply with ice, under all circumstances,” he said.

" german chancellor angela merkel said she was optimistic that a dispute over how to distribute asylum seekers in the eu would soon be resolved after a court ruled on wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach europe. speaking to the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung (f.a.s.) newspaper two weeks before a national election in which she is expected to win a fourth term, merkel said she welcomed the court s decision. separately, the newspaper also reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution, a compromise was starting to emerge which would link accepting refugees to payments that would come from the eu.  the vast majority of eu states had not filed a complaint about redistribution and do not take the view that they never want to take in a refugee so i think there s an opportunity to achieve a distribution of refugees that shows solidarity in the not too distant future,  merkel said in the f.a.s. interview.  in its ruling, the eu s highest court dismissed complaints by slovakia and hungary over the mandatory quotas introduced in 2015 to relocate asylum seekers from greece and italy. immigration has been a key issue during campaigning for germany s sept. 24 election. in the interview, merkel said it was important to show solidarity in dealing with the migration crisis because otherwise there would be no solidarity on other issues in the eu and  that would be bitter for the cohesion of europe .  the newspaper reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution, a compromise was starting to emerge which would link accepting refugees to payments that would come from the eu. citing sources involved in the negotiations, f.a.s. said eu member states had developed ideas such as solving the dispute by creating an incentive system in which the eu would give countries 60,000 euros for each refugee they take in. if an eu member state undercuts its quota by more than half, the 60,000 euros per person should be withdrawn, it said. as the distribution mechanism would be for a maximum of 200,000 refugees per year, it would cost up to 12 billion euros, the newspaper said. it would also be possible to put border guards or national asylum officers in overburdened states so they take in fewer migrants, the newspaper said. interior minister thomas de maiziere had told a saturday newspaper that social benefits for asylum seekers in germany were  quite high  and needed be harmonized across europe.

" while president donald trump opened the door on monday to beefing up u.s. forces in afghanistan, he provided few details on how sending more troops will hasten a conclusion to america’s longest war. “there is no quick fix to this problem,” said bill roggio, an insurgency expert with the foundation for defense of democracies, a washington based policy institute, speaking before trump’s speech. “things will continue looking bleak for some time.” in his approximately 30 minute nationally televised address, trump said he would “expand authority” for u.s. commanders to target militant networks that “sow violence and chaos throughout afghanistan.”   that paves the way to an increase in the 8,400 u.s. troop level in afghanistan and broader rules of engagement as part of his plan to end a military conflict that began in 2001, u.s. officials said. but he declined to say how many more u.s. soldiers will be deployed or how long the u.s. force will be there. “conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables” would guide the duration of u.s. military involvement, he said. his effective embrace of an open ended u.s. deployment contrasts with the expectations of his political base that he would extract the united states from a war estimated to have cost more than $700 billion and claimed the lives of more than 2,400 u.s. service members. but trump, who has railed against the war for years, finds himself boxed in. taliban advances are raising the specter of a repeat of 1996, when islamist militants seized power and provided al qaeda with a sanctuary in which to plot the sept. 11, 2011, attacks in new york and washington. moreover, the afghan government is plagued by ethnic and political rifts and corruption and controls less than 60 percent of the country, similar circumstances that paved the way for the  taliban’s 1996 takeover. “the choice is between losing and not losing. winning really isn’t an option,” said james dobbins, who served as the u.s. special representative to afghanistan and pakistan during the presidency of barack obama and is now a senior fellow at the rand corporation. “he (trump) can lose quickly by withdrawing, he can lose slowly by standing pat” dobbins said, adding that trump “could not lose” by marginally increasing the u.s. force.  the ostensible goal of trump’s strategy is to help afghan security forces reverse taliban advances and create a military stalemate that eventually would compel rebel leaders to agree to a diplomatic resolution of the conflict. yet trump indicated that diplomacy would take a back seat to military operations, saying that, “some day, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the taliban.” sending more u.s. troops could “buy time for the afghan government to increase its legitimacy and gain support for the afghans, which will help them negotiate an end of the conflict,” said scott worden, an expert with the u.s. institute for peace. but worden, also speaking before trump’s speech, said more u.s. troops “alone are not going to outright defeat the taliban. the military components of the strategy have to be coupled with an equal   if not greater   emphasis on managing the politics of afghanistan and the politics of the region.” obama tried and failed with what basically was the same approach. he presided over a far larger effort that at one point involved some 100,000 u.s. troops, considerable airpower, scores of cia drone strikes on extremist sanctuaries in pakistan, and billions of dollars for reconstruction and democratization programs. obama also dedicated enormous diplomatic energy to ending the war, appointing a special envoy to coordinate negotiations. not only has trump eliminated that post, but the administration has proposed slashing the state department budget by about 30 percent and has left scores of senior posts vacant. obama freed five taliban leaders from guantanamo bay and allowed the rebels to open an office in doha. the taliban freed captured u.s. soldier bowe bergdahl, but they refused to be drawn into talks. trump signaled a tougher u.s. approach to pakistan, warning that while it had “much to gain” by cooperating on afghanistan, it would have to immediately stop “harboring” islamist militants “who target” u.s. troops and officials. but again, he provided no details of how he planned to convince pakistan to do so. u.s. officials have long accused pakistan of failing to pursue top leaders of the taliban and the allied haqqani network and to end sanctuaries and support for the extremists from elements of the powerful military and army run intelligence agency, an allegation islamabad denies.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has hired two people with close ties to u.s. organized labor to try to lock down support from union members as republican candidate donald trump makes courting working class voters central to his campaign.      the two new staffers, lori d’orazio and michele gilliam, are to be deputy labor campaign directors, according to a campaign aide. d’orazio is moving to the campaign from the biggest u.s. labor federation, the afl cio. gilliam is a former staffer for senator bernie sanders of vermont, who was clinton’s fiercest primary competitor.     clinton and sanders battled fiercely over union support during the democratic primary, with clinton, the presumptive nominee, ultimately securing the bulk of the national endorsements from labor unions. but she will need to harness the on the ground manpower of unions in crucial battleground states ahead of november’s general election match up with the populist presumptive republican nominee, trump. the aide said the campaign is counting on d’orazio and gilliam to do just that. although organized labor is a traditionally democratic constituency, trump has made a play to win over rank and file union members by criticizing international trade deals such as the pending trans pacific partnership, which labor opposes. even so, afl cio president richard trumka warned last month when the federation endorsed clinton that a trump presidency would be disastrous for u.s. workers and vowed to mobilize the group’s resources to defeat him.  the afl cio is the largest u.s. federation of labor unions that collectively represent more than 12 million workers. before joining the afl cio, d’orazio worked for another large u.s. union, the united auto workers, and gilliam once served as an organizer for a local chapter of the transport workers union.

" president barack obama on tuesday said he would seek changes in the way u.s. oil and coal resources are managed, prompting a flood of reaction from environmental groups pushing him to do more to limit fossil fuel production   and producers anxious about regulatory changes. “i’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet,” obama said in his state of the union address. as he enters his final year in office, obama is looking to secure his legacy on priorities like curbing climate change. the white house did not provide details on tuesday. “that’s an issue i would say, stay tuned for the months ahead,” white house communications director jen psaki told reporters during a briefing ahead of the speech. “this is not a speech where i would expect a 25 page fact sheet. this is more talking about his vision and the issues we need to address,” psaki said. the western energy alliance, a group that represents oil and natural gas companies that drill on public lands in the western states, said it suspected the lack of immediate details meant that obama would look for ways to act without congress. “he’ll close out his term by continuing to issue new rules through the federal agencies that kill jobs and economic growth in order to promote his climate change agenda,” said tim wigley, the group’s president, in a statement. environmental groups noted obama’s pledge comes as his administration works on a new five year plan for offshore oil and gas leases. they are also calling for changes to rules for production of oil and gas on federal lands. “for far too long, the interior department has given away our publicly owned fossil fuels to mining and drilling companies without regard for the damage they cause to communities and our climate,” said annie leonard, executive director of greenpeace usa, in a statement.

" legislators from ugandan president yoweri museveni s party on tuesday agreed to introduce a law to remove an age limit from the country s constitution, potentially allowing him to extend his rule, two lawmakers told reuters. the east african country s existing constitution bars anyone over 75 from standing as a presidential candidate. museveni, 73, is already one of africa s longest serving rulers and has been in charge for more than three decades. the next elections are due in 2021. oil rich uganda is a staunch western ally and receives substantial aid and support for its security forces, partly for sending troops to somalia as part of an african union peacekeeping mission. when he first came to power, museveni was lauded for helping restore stability after two murderous dictators known to use torture and extrajudicial executions widely, and for directing the suppression of a brutal insurgency known for mutilating civilians and kidnapping children. but over the years, criticism has mounted over the suppression of the political opposition, widespread corruption and a poor human rights record. simeo nsubuga, a legislator from museveni s ruling national resistance movement (nrm) party, told reuters the move to amend the constitution was agreed in a special meeting of the party s house members.  we agreed that a private member should come up with a constitutional amendment bill to remove the age limit,  nsubuga said, adding the bill would be introduced on the floor next week. in july, uganda s deputy attorney general said cabinet was planning to introduce similar legislation. most ugandan laws are introduced by the government via cabinet ministers. but kafuuzi jackson karugaba, another nrm legislator, told reuters they had decided to take the option of a private member s bill because cabinet was moving  too slowly.   in 2005, nrm legislators changed the constitution and removed a limit of two five year terms, allowing museveni to extend his reign. independent observers said that last year s presidential election lacked transparency and that the poll body lacked credibility. the ageing leader has himself not stated whether he intends to seek another term, and officials have said the proposed constitutional change was not specifically to benefit the incumbent but all of uganda s future leaders.

" in april, reuters photographer zohra bensemra was sent to cover the drought in somalia. once there, she looked for ways to humanize the plight of more than 2 million people trying to survive the famine amid fields of withered crops and the brittle skeletons of livestock.  see her portfolio of work here in a makeshift camp for displaced people, bensemra met zeinab, a 14 year old girl forced to marry an older man offering $1,000 as her dowry. zeinab had wanted to become an english teacher, but that small fortune made it possible for her extended family to travel to a somali town on the ethiopian border where international aid agencies providing food for drought refugees. bensemra found similar stories during a nearly two week trip through the horn of africa.  photography opens eyes to what s going on in the world,  says bensemra, who was named agency photographer of the year by the guardian, a u.k. based newspaper.  it s not about nationalism or religion but about human beings.   the guardian recognized bensemra s 2017 work covering some of the planet s most dire situations: the fight against islamic state in iraq and syria; the rohingya refugee crisis; and the drought in somalia, among others.  read the story here in bensemra s role as an eyewitness to war, human rights abuses and other atrocities, she says it is crucial to remain unbiased.  it s important to stay neutral if we want people to believe us and trust us,  bensemra says.  we have to be in the middle. we don t take sides.  read her photographer profile here based in algeria, bensemra says she believes being a woman in the field has its advantages. for one, people are more likely to open up to her and share their stories.  one of her most memorable photographs of the year shows an exhausted khatla ali abdallah, 90, fleeing a battle with islamic state outside mosul in february. bensemra had tears in her eyes as she shot the photograph, imagining the woman as her own grandmother, but unable to help.  when you see people suffering and living very, very hard lives, i imagine myself in their place,  she says.

" divers searching waters near copenhagen found a second arm on wednesday that police said probably belonged to swedish journalist kim wall, who died in august on board a danish inventor s submarine. the divers found wall s left arm on nov. 21 in the same area of koge bay near the danish capital. police said the second arm, like the first one, had been weighed down by pieces of metal to prevent it floating to the surface.  the arm has not been investigated yet but it was found in the same area where we found the first arm and it was weighed down in the same way,  police spokesman jens moller jensen said in a statement. coroners will examine the arm on thursday. danish inventor peter madsen has admitted to dismembering wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he denies murdering her and also denies a charge of sexual assault without intercourse. wall, a freelance journalist who was researching a story on madsen, went missing after he took her out to sea in his homebuilt 17 metre (56 foot) submarine in august. wall s cause of death has yet to be determined.  on aug. 23, police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in copenhagen as wall s. in october, police said they had recovered her head and legs.

" u.s. president donald trump’s rollback on his predecessor’s liberalization of travel to cuba will all but eliminate a burgeoning market for independent tourism, forcing would be visitors into organized trips, experts said. that policy change could be bad news for airlines that have been helped by demand from solo travelers and families who have booked seats for ad hoc informal “cultural exchanges” that had passed muster under former president barack obama’s loosened rules.  “it’s going to frustrate airlines who scheduled service on the premise that travel restrictions would eventually be removed,” robert mann, analyst at r.w. mann & co, said. “it was an ‘if you build it they will come’ kind of a philosophy.” now, under directives announced by trump on friday, independent travel to cuba from the united states will once again be forbidden, complicating the already tricky to navigate industry.  the new policy will ban most u.s. business transactions with the armed forces business enterprises group, a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel and hospitality industry, but make some exceptions, including air and sea travel. [nl1n1jd02o] the president’s directive will essentially shield u.s. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island but dim a potentially bright outlook for travel growth between the countries.  while the industry at large is bracing for weakened demand following the policy shift, specialized travel agents could potentially see a windfall as travelers rush to book authorized organized trips to the island. “you can’t get through to our call line. we’re receiving 10 times the emails we were this morning,” tom popper, president of travel agency insightcuba, which organizes legal group tours of the tourism restricted island, said on friday. u.s. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, washington lobby group engage cuba said in a recent report. (tmsnrt.rs/2rbfmti) while trump’s new policy avoids the worst case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on cuba as a new high growth market.   “if the goal is to help cuban entrepreneurs, adding job killing regulations on u.s. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer,” james williams, president of engage cuba, said in a statement.     marriott international inc on friday urged the white house to improve relations with post castro cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain, operates the gaviota 5th avenue hotel, which is owned by the cuban military. the treasury department said on its website that travel related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the office of foreign assets control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the marriott venture. airlines for america, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and “will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to cuba.” obama’s initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into cuba in mid 2016. some early entrants, including smaller carriers frontier airlines, silver airways and spirit airlines inc, have pulled out. while larger u.s. carriers have pared back flights to smaller cuban cities, american airlines, delta, united continental, southwest and jetblue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to havana.  cruise operator carnival corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was “pleased” its ships could continue to sail to cuba.

" the united states on wednesday opened a $2 million tender to help clear unexploded bombs in cambodia weeks after the government s mine clearance agency said its u.s. funding had been stopped. relations between cambodia and the united states have spiraled downwards this year with the government accusing americans of involvement in a plan by detained opposition leader kem sokha to bring down prime minister hun sen. washington has rejected the accusations as baseless. last week, it said it was cutting aid for next year s election and would take further steps after the opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) was dissolved by the supreme court at the government s request. the u.s. embassy said it was accepting applications for a $2 million one year grant to survey and clear unexploded ordnance in eastern cambodia, which suffered heavy u.s. bombing during the war in neighboring vietnam.  the united states has supported humanitarian demining in cambodia for over 20 years and is committed to addressing our war time legacy,  ambassador william heidt said in a statement.  we are looking for the best national and international experts.  the size of the contract matches the amount which the government s cambodian mine action centre said earlier this month had been cut from funding it received from the united states through norwegian people s aid.  we welcome the commitment in taking part in addressing the legacy of the war,  said huy vannak, undersecretary of state at the interior ministry. china, now cambodia s closest ally, was quick to step in with an offer of help for demining soon afterwards. china is cambodia s biggest donor and investor and has played an ever more prominent role as western countries have criticized a crackdown on the opposition, civil society groups and media ahead of next year s election. although it has not taken action, the european union pointed out last week that cambodia s access to duty free access vital to its garment industry depended on respect for human rights. hun sen told garment workers on wednesday that they would be the ones to suffer   not him   if the access was withdrawn. european union countries accounted for about 40 percent of cambodia s exports in 2016. most of that was clothing.  you must remember clearly that if there is any cut of buying orders, it s all the fault of a group of people of the opposition party,  hun sen told garment workers in phnom penh.  hun sen won t die but workers, you will die,  he said. the prime minister accused exiled opposition leaders of trying to get sanctions imposed. they have so far said they would not call for measures to curb trade because of the impact it could have on the livelihoods of an estimated 700,000 garment workers. cambodia s economy has proved largely immune to political turbulence. the world bank said on wednesday it expected the economy to grow 6.9 percent next year, compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017, despite risks including uncertainty over the election.

" south korea warned north korea on wednesday that the united states and its allies were working on sanctions to inflict “bone numbing pain” after its latest nuclear test, and urged china to do its part to rein in its isolated neighbor.  with tension high on the border after the north’s fourth nuclear test on wednesday last week, south korean forces fired shots toward what yonhap news agency said was a suspected north korean drone.  it returned to the north after the shots, south korean military officials told reuters. the north’s nuclear test angered both china and the united states and again raised questions about what can be done to stop its development of nuclear weapons. the world economic forum withdrew its invitation for north korea’s foreign minister to attend its annual davos meeting because of the nuclear test. it was to have been the country’s first participation in the event in 18 years. the u.s. house of representatives voted nearly unanimously on tuesday to pass legislation to broaden sanctions on the north. but apparently unperturbed by the prospect of further international isolation, north korean leader kim jong un called for an expansion of the size and power of his country’s nuclear arsenal, urging the “detonation of more powerful h bombs”, the north’s state media reported. north korea said last week it had tested a powerful hydrogen bomb but the united states and various experts doubt that, as the blast was roughly the same size as that from its previous test, of an atomic bomb, in 2013. south korean president park geun hye said more “provocations” by the north including “cyber terrorism” were possible and new sanctions should be tougher than previous ones. she did not give specifics. “we are cooperating closely with the united states and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make north korea feel bone numbing pain, not only at the security council but also bilaterally and multilaterally,” she said in a speech. park said south korea and china were discussing a u.n. security council resolution on north korea, noting that china had stated repeatedly that it would not tolerate its nuclear program. china is north korea’s main ally and trade partner but it opposes its bombs, while beijing’s ties with south korea have grown closer in recent years. “i am certain that china is very well aware if such a strong will isn’t followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the north’s fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability,” park said. “i believe the chinese government will not allow the situation on the korean peninsula to deteriorate further.” sung kim, u.s. special representative for north korea policy, met with his south korean and japanese counterparts in seoul on wednesday and said the three agreed that a “meaningful” new sanctions resolution was needed from the security council. “i hope the chinese authorities agree with us that we simply cannot take a business as usual approach to this latest provocation. we will be working very closely with them to come up with a meaningful resolution,” he said. in washington, white house deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said china could and should put more pressure on north korea. “we understand their concern about instability on the korean peninsula, but the fact of the matter is that the current status quo is destabilizing where you have nuclear tests,” he told a news briefing. rhodes said it was important the united states and its allies developed capabilities to respond and referred to sunday’s u.s. b 52 bomber flight over south korea, missile defense and military cooperation with both south korea and japan. rhodes also said that president barack obama chose not to mention north korea in his state of the union address on tuesday as he did not want to give kim jong un the attention. “he likes attention and probably would like nothing more than the president to spend a lot of time to talk about it in the state of the union,” rhodes said. “we didn’t particularly feel compelled to give him that attention.” china rejects complaints it is not doing enough on north korea. in beijing, foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said china’s efforts toward a denuclearised korean peninsula would continue. “this is in everyone’s interests and is everyone’s responsibility, including china and south korea,” he said. the u.s. house sanctions measure passed by 418 2 and senate leaders expect to consider a similar bill shortly. the house bill had been introduced in 2015 but was brought up for a vote only after north korea’s latest test. “(the bill) uses targeted financial pressure to isolate kim jong un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in foreign banks, and from the hard currency that sustains their rule,” said republican representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee and an author of the measure. to become law, it must also pass the u.s. senate and be signed by obama. the 28,500 u.s. troops in south korea have been put on high alert as a noisy propaganda battle is played out across the heavily fortified border with the north. south korea, still technically at war with the north since their 1950 53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, has for days been blaring propaganda through loudspeakers across the border. south korea’s military said it had found anti south leaflets in the seoul area, which it suspects were dropped from north korean hot air balloons. south korean financial regulators met computer security officials at 16 banks and financial institutions and urged vigilance in the face of possible cyberattacks by north korea, although none has been detected.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on friday warned other countries and groups against using lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the middle east, saying the united states strongly backed lebanon s independence. tillerson said he recognized saad al hariri as lebanon s prime minister and called him a  strong partner of the united states.  hariri unexpectedly resigned his post at the weekend from the saudi arabian capital of riyadh and accused iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world. his resignation thrust lebanon into the front line of a regional competition between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran that has also buffeted syria, iraq, yemen and bahrain. tillerson s backing of hariri and the lebanese government contrasted sharply with the approach taken by u.s. ally saudi arabia which has lumped lebanon with hezbollah as parties hostile to it.  there is no legitimate place or role in lebanon for any foreign forces, militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the lebanese state,  tillerson said in a statement. lebanese authorities have said hariri is being held against his will in saudi arabia, a charge that riyadh has denied. tillerson earlier said there was no indication hariri was being held in saudi arabia against his will but that washington was monitoring the situation.  tillerson s statement said there was no legitimate role in lebanon for any  foreign forces, militias or armed elements    an apparent reference to hezbollah and its regional backer, iran. but tillerson also cautioned against  any party, within or outside lebanon, using lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country.

" a formal u.s. recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel would be the  kiss of death  to the two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict, the palestine liberation organization s chief representative in washington said on monday.  should such a step be taken, it would have catastrophic consequences,  husam zomlot told reuters in an interview.   that would be actually the kiss of death to the two state solution because jerusalem is at the very heart of the two state solution,  zomlot said. a senior administration official told reuters last week that u.s. president donald trump would likely make the announcement on wednesday, although his adviser and son in law, jared kushner, said the president had not yet made a final decision. such a declaration would break with decades of u.s. policy and could fuel violence in the middle east. past u.s. presidents have insisted that the status of jerusalem   home to sites holy to the jewish, muslim and christian religions   must be decided in negotiations between the two sides.  should the two state solution receive that final lethal blow, then the main reaction from us will be strategic and political because we are not going to be engaged in an empty process,  zomlot said. israeli officials have made clear they would welcome u.s. endorsement of their claim of sovereignty over all of jerusalem.     there was no immediate comment from the israeli government to zomlot s comments. israel captured arab east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war. it later annexed it, declaring the whole of the city as its capital   a move not recognized internationally. palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state. kushner is leading trump s efforts to restart long stalled israeli palestinian peace talks, efforts that so far have shown little progress. zomlot warned the role of the united states as a mediator in the conflict would be effectively torpedoed if trump declared jerusalem the capital of israel.  it will be a self inflicted disqualification of the u.s. from the role of the mediator ... (which) will be irreversible because by then the u.s. would be part of the problem, not part of the solution,  he said. trump suggested earlier this year he was open to new ways to achieve middle east peace that did not necessarily entail the creation of a palestinian state, a hallmark of u.s. policy for decades. trump is again expected to delay moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv, u.s. officials said on friday, speaking on condition of anonymity. saudi arabia s ambassador to washington, prince khalid bin salman, said on monday that any u.s. announcement on the status of jerusalem before a final settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict would harm the peace process and increase regional tensions.  jordan, the arab league and turkey have also warned against the dangers of such a move.

" president donald trump pledged to uphold americans’ right to possess guns on friday in a speech that he used to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing a democratic senator as “pocahontas.” trump pledged his allegiance to the powerful national rifle association, the country’s leading gun rights advocacy group, at a convention attended by thousands. elected in part on a law and order platform, trump was the first sitting president to address the nra since fellow republican ronald reagan in 1983. “as your president, i will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms,” trump told thousands of people attending the nra’s annual convention in atlanta, georgia. trump, whose candidacy last year was endorsed by the nra, marks his first 100 days in office on saturday with no major legislative achievements but with a long litany of actions to loosen federal regulations and review free trade agreements. stymied by his initial bid to build a wall along the u.s. mexican border when congress balked at funding the initiative, trump vowed he will sooner or later build the wall, which had been a signature campaign promise. “we need a wall. we’ll build the wall. don’t even think about it,” he said. politics and his unexpected election victory on nov. 8 over democrat hillary clinton also featured prominently in his remarks. speculating on who might run for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, trump brought up the name of u.s. senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and used a derogatory nickname he had adopted for her last year. “it may be pochahontas, and she is not big on the nra,” trump said of warren, who had once said she had some native american ancestry. pocahontas is a legendary native american figure from the 1600s. trump later attended a fund raiser for republican candidate karen handel, who will face democrat jon ossoff on june 20 to determine who will win a house of representatives seat to replace tom price, who became trump’s health and human services secretary. trump, at the nra event, returned time and again to the theme of responsible gun ownership. “you have a true friend and champion in the white house,” he said. “we want to assure you of the sacred right of self defense for all of our citizens.” ",0
" u.s. president donald trump dismissed a chinese diplomatic effort to rein in north korea s weapons program as a failure on thursday, while secretary of state rex tillerson said beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to pyongyang. in a tweet, trump delivered another insulting barb against north korean leader kim jong un, who he called  little rocket man  and a  sick puppy  after north korea test fired its most advanced missile to date on wednesday.  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said washington s approach was dangerously provocative.  trump s tweets further inflamed tensions reignited this week after north korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in a  breakthrough  that put the u.s. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons whose warheads could withstand re entry to the earth s atmosphere.  the chinese envoy, who just returned from north korea, seems to have had no impact on little rocket man,  trump said on twitter, a day after speaking with chinese president chinese president xi jinping and reiterating his call for beijing to use its leverage against north korea. tillerson on thursday welcomed chinese efforts on north korea, but said beijing could do more to limit its oil exports to the country.  the chinese are doing a lot. we do think they could do more with the oil. we re really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely,  tillerson said at the state department. china is north korea s neighbor and its sole major trading partner. while trump has been bellicose at times in rhetoric toward north korea, tillerson has persistently held out hopes for a return to dialogue if north korea shows it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons program.  however, tillerson may not remain in his job long, with disagreements with trump over north korea being one factor. on thursday, senior trump administration officials said the white house was considering a plan to replace tillerson with mike pompeo, the director of the central intelligence agency. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said he still had confidence in diplomatic efforts on north korea and that the united states would be  unrelenting  in working through the united nations. in spite of trump s rhetoric and warnings that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with north korea, his administration has stressed it favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis.  trump has pledged more sanctions in response to the latest  test and, at an emergency u.n. security council meeting late wednesday, the united states warned north korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out.  this administration is focused on one big thing when it comes to north korea, and that s denuclearization of the korean peninsula,  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told a regular white house briefing.  anything beyond that is not the priority at this point,  she said, responding to a question on whether regime change was on the administration s agenda after trump s recent tweets and a speech by u.n. ambassador nikki haley. lavrov pointed to joint u.s. south korean military exercises planned for december and accused the united states of trying to provoke kim into  flying off the handle  over his missile program to hand washington a pretext to destroy his country.   he also flatly rejected a u.s. call for russia to cut ties with pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile program, calling u.s. policy toward north korea deeply flawed. in a call with trump on thursday, south korean president moon jae in said the missile launched this week was north korea s most advanced so far, but it was unclear whether pyongyang had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and it still needed to prove other things, such as its re entry technology. a white house statement said trump and moon reiterated their strong commitment to enhancing the deterrence and defense capabilities of the u.s. south korea alliance and added:  both leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to compelling north korea to return to the path of denuclearization at any cost.  north korea has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under kim s leadership and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in september. it has said its weapons programs are a necessary defense against u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea as a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war, denies any such intention. previous u.s. administrations have failed to stop north korea from developing nuclear weapons and a sophisticated missile program. trump, who has previously said the united states would  totally destroy  north korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from the nuclear threat, has also struggled to contain pyongyang since taking office in january.

" donald trump’s support has surged and he is now running nearly even with democrat hillary clinton among likely u.s. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became the republican party’s presumptive presidential nominee, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday.  the results could signal a close fight between the two likely white house rivals as americans make up their minds ahead of the nov. 8 election to succeed democratic president barack obama. as recently as last week, clinton led trump by around 13 points in the poll.  in the most recent survey, 41 percent of likely voters supported clinton, the democratic front runner, and 40 percent backed trump, with 19 percent not decided on either yet, according to the online poll of 1,289 people conducted from friday to tuesday. the poll had a credibility interval of about 3 percentage points.  the results reflect a big increase in support for trump since he knocked out u.s. senator ted cruz of texas and ohio governor john kasich last week to become the last republican in the white house race.  there was no immediate comment from the clinton or trump campaigns.  clinton, who has all but clinched the democratic nomination over rival bernie sanders, has mostly led trump in the head to head poll this year. trump briefly matched her support a few times in 2016, most recently in mid march, after u.s. senator marco rubio of florida, a favorite of the republican establishment, dropped out.

" the pentagon’s acquisition chief said on wednesday she wants to cut the time for major procurements to 12 months from an average of 2.5 years, speaking during a congressional hearing on the reorganization of the defense department’s procurement system. the pentagon typically takes months and often years to make procurement decisions, especially for major weapons programs. a more rapid procurement process could accelerate the pace of orders for weapons makers like lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp. during the hearing of the u.s. senate armed services committee, panel chairman senator john mccain called the pentagon’s buying program a “system of organized irresponsibility.” the pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics ellen lord, was asked her goal for cutting back time for weapons procurement and she responded “12 months for major programs.” lord, who began working at the pentagon in august, was formerly chief executive of defense contractor textron systems, an aerospace and defense company that makes drones and missiles. if the acquisition process is shortened it would be good for larger weapons makers because time is money, byron callan, a defense analyst at capital alpha partners, said in an interview. the move could also increase competition from smaller companies that often lack the financial resources to wait out lengthy pentagon procurements, he said.  the pentagon’s weapons procurement process generally begins by soliciting proposals from industry, often includes a competitive process to find a vendor, as well as product testing before delivery and final payment. critics say the decision making part of the current procurement process takes too long and could be reduced. mark esper, secretary of the army, said his office was examining a way to reduce the requirements development process, where the military articulates the concept of what it needs, to 12 months from five years. the 2017 national defense authorization act (ndaa) changed the structure of the pentagon’s office of acquisition by splitting it into two new positions, an undersecretary for research and engineering focusing on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment focusing on program management.  that process is still unfolding, but during the hearing testimony showed the initial effect was that decision making for some procurement processes had moved to individual branches of the u.s. military.

" president donald trump paid $38 million in taxes on more than $150 million in income in 2005, the white house said on tuesday, responding to an msnbc report that the network had obtained two pages of the returns. msnbc host rachel maddow said she received the documents from journalist david cay johnston, who said on her show that he received them in the mail. the returns, which msnbc posted on its website, showed trump paid an effective federal tax rate of 25 percent in 2005 after writing off $100 million in losses.  the white house said in a statement that trump took into account “large scale depreciation for construction.” trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, drawing criticism throughout his campaign last year and speculation from his political rivals he was hiding something. a new york times report in october said trump, a new york real estate developer, declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns. the newspaper said the large tax deduction could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. but the returns posted by msnbc on tuesday showed that he did pay taxes in 2005. the returns do not indicate whether he paid taxes in other years or how much he might have paid. the washington post reported last year that trump paid no federal income taxes for at least two years in the late 1970s. the white house said in a statement on tuesday that trump, as head of the trump organization, had a responsibility “to pay no more tax than legally required.” presidents and major candidates for the white house have routinely released their income tax returns.  trump says he has not released his tax returns because they are under audit by the internal revenue service. experts say an irs audit does not bar someone from releasing the documents. during a september presidential debate, democratic candidate hillary clinton criticized trump, a republican, for paying no federal income taxes. “that makes me smart,” he responded. trump has feuded with the media since his inauguration, often accusing it of promoting “fake news” intended to undermine his presidency. “the dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all americans,” the white house said on tuesday.

" less than a year before a presidential election, mexico s politicians are fearful they could be punished by voters for any misstep in responding to two major earthquakes that killed more than 300 people this month. with tolerance low after years of violence and corruption, the tremors could further undermine voters  confidence in the ruling party of president enrique pena nieto and the entire political class.  we re clearly aware that this is a test we cannot flunk,  said senator miguel angel chico of the ruling institutional revolutionary party, or pri. pena nieto sprang into action this month after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake on sept. 7, the strongest in nearly a century, leveled parts of southern mexico and killed at least 98 people.  on tuesday, when a 7.1 tremor struck, he aborted a trip to the first quake s disaster zone to return to mexico city, where 38 buildings collapsed killing scores of people, including more than 20 children at a school.  pena nieto went to the school as rescuers searched for children and adults trapped inside.  the death toll from tuesday s quake, which struck the capital and nearby states on the anniversary of a devastating 1985 tremor, has reached 230. politicians from all sides called for solidarity and praised how mexicans, many of whom volunteered to help climb through rubble and search for survivors, had come together. nonetheless, one figure loomed large over the fallout from the quakes and any instability it may generate ahead of the july vote: leftist andres manuel lopez obrador, long the bete noire of mexico s political establishment and the frontrunner in many polls. lopez obrador, or amlo as he is known, enjoys widespread support in the left leaning capital, home to about 20 million people. the former mexico city mayor, who narrowly lost the two previous presidential elections, won praise from supporters after the first quake when he proposed donating 20 percent of his party s federal campaign funds for victims. on wednesday, volunteers across mexico flocked to help remove debris and donate supplies in a grass roots effort that opposition national action party (pan) senator daniel avila said was symptomatic of widespread distrust of the political class and the government s ability to deliver.   i think voters could look to punish those currently in government if they don t manage this situation well,  avila said.  the pri, which ran mexico for an uninterrupted 71 years and currently places third in the polls, knows the political damage that earthquakes can inflict. pri president miguel de la madrid led the country during a powerful 1985 quake, which killed thousands in mexico city  exactly 32 years to the day before tuesday s tremor.  de la madrid was widely criticized for his response, worsening already broad discontent with the party s corrupt, authoritarian rule at the time. after the quake, the pri gradually lost support and was voted out in 2000.  now, party supporters hope that a swift response nationwide can avoid a repeat of that loss. governors from the pri and its coalition partner the green party are in office in oaxaca and chiapas, the states hardest hit by the first quake this month. and the pri narrowly won a recent gubernatorial race in the state of mexico, a longstanding party bastion where at least 12 people had died by wednesday. there have been accusations that aid has disproportionately benefited wealthier areas. in the capital, fashionable districts like roma and condesa received most of the organized assistance. with a glut of people arriving to help and little guidance on how to best use resources, volunteers struggled, said 34 year old art professor camila morales, adding that in poorer districts there had been insufficient help.   on the outskirts in the south of the city ... there is no help arriving, they still don t even have power,  said morales, who was part of a large volunteer group from a local university.  on social media, a campaign emerged to prevent politicians from capitalizing on the earthquake. following lopez obrador s lead, one petition sought to get the federal government to divert electoral funds for political parties to helping victims. quickly, other politicians jumped on board.     enrique ochoa, the pri chairman and one of the leftist s fiercest critics, on wednesday tweeted:  i ask that the parties get together to resolve ... how we can donate campaign money, without pretense or opportunism.

" german parties exploring a coalition government have dealt an early blow to french president emmanuel macron s hopes for more expansive fiscal policies from berlin, backing a balanced budget and rejecting the idea of a separate pot of cash for the euro zone. the greens, seen as closest to macron on economic policy and europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the free democrats (fdp) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline. merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro business fdp and the greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy. in a joint paper agreed after late night talks on tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. a senior greens politician who participated in the talks also told reuters that the parties were united in opposing macron s idea for a euro zone budget.  none of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  said reinhard buetikofer, a member of the european parliament. the parties are expected to reconvene on thursday to finalize a joint paper on europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on tuesday. that blueprint included a pledge to respect  debt brake  legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of gdp. it also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the  solidarity tax  for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make german homes more energy efficient. cem ozdemir, a leader of the greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing  grand coalition  of merkel s conservatives and the social democrats (spd), who are moving into opposition. tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final. the greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a  pro european  answer to proposals from macron and european commission president jean claude juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.  there are a lot of differences to overcome. but i am hoping for a clear commitment to europe,  said ozdemir in a video posted on the greens website. buetikofer said the greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing eu budget. but their rejection of macron s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary  cave in  to merkel s conservatives and the fdp. macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. one fdp participant who requested anonymity suggested that the greens may have given away too much in the talks on tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members. former chancellor gerhard schroeder, a social democrat who ruled with the greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of  preparing frau merkel s bed  in a desperate attempt to re enter government. immigration could also be a contentious issue in the coalition talks as merkel s conservatives row back on the open door policy towards refugees that she adopted in 2015. this will also be on the agenda on thursday.

" nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said on thursday he would not interfere in the u.s. election campaign, but said that solidarity among allies was a key value for the group. “this is good for european security and good for u.s. security,” the nato head said in a statement. “the united states has always stood by its european allies.” stoltenberg’s comments came after republican presidential nominee donald trump raised fresh questions about his commitment to automatically defend nato allies if they were attacked, the new york times reported.

" u.s. president donald trump’s administration declined to name any major trading partner as a currency manipulator in a highly anticipated report on friday, backing away from a key trump campaign promise to slap such a label on china. the semi annual u.s. treasury currency report did, however, keep china on a currency “monitoring list” despite a lower global current account surplus, citing china’s unusually large, bilateral trade surplus with the united states. five other trading partners who were on last october’s monitoring list   japan, south korea, taiwan, germany and switzerland   also remain on the list, ensuring that the treasury would apply extra scrutiny to their foreign exchange and economic policies. the treasury report recognized what many analysts have said over the past year, namely that china has recently intervened in foreign exchange markets to prop up the value of its yuan currency, not push it lower to make chinese exports cheaper.  foreign exchange experts told reuters last week that a manipulator label was unlikely for beijing. trump, who on the campaign trail blamed china for “stealing” u.s. jobs and prosperity by cheapening its currency, repeatedly promised to label the country as a currency manipulator on “day one” of a trump administration   a move that would require special negotiations and could lead to punitive duties and other action. the report did call out china’s past efforts to hold down the yuan’s value, saying this created a long term “distortion” in the global trading system that “imposed significant and long lasting hardship on american workers and companies.” the treasury also warned that it will scrutinize china’s trade and currency practices very closely and called for faster opening of china’s economy to u.s. goods and services and a shift away from exports to more domestic consumption.    “china will need to demonstrate that its lack of intervention to resist appreciation over the last three years represents a durable policy shift by letting the rmb (yuan) rise with market forces once appreciation pressures resume,” the report said. the report shows the trump administration is taking an approach to foreign exchange based on data rather than politics, said nathan sheets, a former u.s. treasury under secretary for international affairs during the obama administration. “this isn’t the report that donald trump had in mind on nov. 8,” said sheets, who is now with the peterson institute for international economics in washington. “but it lays out legitimate complaints. it’s a clear statement to the chinese that they need progress.” the treasury did not alter its three major thresholds for identifying currency manipulation put in place last year by the obama administration: a bilateral trade surplus with the united states of $20 billion or more; a global current account surplus of more than 3 percent of gross domestic product, and persistent foreign exchange purchases equal to 2 percent of gdp over 12 months.  no countries were determined to have met all three of these criteria, but japan, south korea, taiwan, germany and switzerland all met two of them. the treasury warned japan against resuming currency interventions, saying that these “should be reserved only to very exceptional circumstances with appropriate prior consultations, consistent with japan’s g 7 and g 20 commitments.” (for graphic on currency manipulation, click tmsnrt.rs/2p7auox) (link to the treasury report: bit.ly/2pgnnam) ",0
" tom price was sworn in as u.s. secretary of health on friday, putting in place a determined opponent of obamacare to help president donald trump fulfill his pledge to dismantle his predecessor’s law and reshape the country’s healthcare system. as head of the department of health and human services (hhs) price has the authority to rewrite rules implementing the 2010 affordable care act, also known as obamacare. he could move quickly to rework the regulations while waiting for republicans in congress to keep their pledge to scrap the law entirely. the republican president signed an order on jan. 20, his first day in office, to freeze regulations and take other steps to weaken the law enacted by former democratic president barack obama, a directive that will fall largely on price. but trump  said in a recent fox news interview that a replacement for the law may not come until next year.    trump said on friday the effort was a “difficult process” but could now get going with price in place. “now we get down to the final strokes,” he told reporters at a separate news conference at the white house alongside visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe. he did not offer more details but said the country would end up with “tremendous healthcare at a lower price.”         republicans, who have long viewed obamacare as federal overreach and who have the majority in congress, are trying to craft a replacement but have not agreed on one. twenty million americans gained health insurance under the law. “having dr. tom price at the helm of hhs gives us a committed ally in our work to repeal and replace obamacare,” said u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan, who has vowed to pass a new plan this year.  price, a member of the house since 2005 who chaired the budget committee, offered legislation in 2015 to repeal obamacare and replace it with age adjusted tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. while price’s fellow republicans have controlled the house since 2011, they did not advance his bill and it was not considered by the full chamber. the senate voted 52 47 earlier on friday to approve price, a former orthopedic surgeon, to oversee the hhs, which has an annual budget of more than $1 trillion.     price’s nomination was dogged by questions about his trading in hundreds of thousands of dollars in health company stocks while working on healthcare legislation. democrats accused him of making misleading statements. price defended his actions. democrats also criticized price for his opposition to obamacare, his ideas about restructuring the medicare program for the elderly and disabled, and his opposition to planned parenthood, an organization that provides abortions and other affordable healthcare and education services. with price confirmed, the senate is expected to vote on monday on trump’s u.s. treasury secretary designate, steven mnuchin.

" the republican chairman of the u.s. senate committee that handles judicial nominations on tuesday raised concerns about two of president donald trump’s picks for lower court positions, citing controversial statements each has made. senator chuck grassley, who chairs the influential judiciary committee, in comments first reported by cnn cast doubt on whether the republican controlled u.s. senate will vote to confirm the two nominees. grassley told cnn the white house should “reconsider” the nomination of jeff mateer for a district judgeship in texas and “should not proceed” on the nomination of brett talley for a district court vacancy in alabama.  “chairman grassley has been concerned about statements made by nominees mateer and talley, and he’s conveyed those concerns to the white house,” say taylor foy, a grassley spokesman.  grassley did not specify what statements he was referring to. but talley was reported by online magazine slate to have posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of white supremacist group the ku klux klan, often known as the kkk. he also failed to disclose that his wife works in the white house counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. mateer has run into trouble over speeches he made in 2015. in one, he referred to transgender children as being part of “satan’s plans,” cnn reported. talley’s nomination has already been approved by the committee, but foy said the statements that troubled grassley only became public after that vote on nov 9. no action has been taken on mateer’s nomination, and the senate has not scheduled a vote on talley. trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges. so far the senate has confirmed 16 of his nominees to district and appeals courts as well as his appointee to the supreme court, neil gorsuch. a white house spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

" the united states has decided to deny egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million because of its failure to make progress on respecting human rights and democratic norms, two sources familiar with the matter said on tuesday. the decision reflects a u.s. desire to continue security cooperation as well as frustration with cairo s stance on civil liberties, notably a new law that regulates non governmental organizations that is widely seen as part a growing crackdown on dissent, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. u.s. officials were especially unhappy that egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi in may allowed the ngo law to go into effect. human rights groups and activists have said that it effectively bans their work and makes it harder for charities to operate. egyptian officials had assured u.s. officials earlier this year that the law, which restricts ngo activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non compliance, would not go through, the sources said. spokespeople for the white house and the state department were not immediately available for comment. egypt is an important mideast partner for the united states because of its control of the suez canal and its border with israel. the sources said the administration had decided to  reprogram  $65.7 million in fiscal year 2017 foreign military financing funds (fmf) and $30 million in fiscal year 2016 economic support fund (esf) funds.  reprogramming  means these funds would be used for other purposes and would not go to egypt. the administration made a separate decision to withhold $195 million in fiscal year 2016 foreign military financing funds which, had it not acted, would have expired and ceased to be available at the end of the current fiscal year on sept. 30. the second decision also illustrated the administration s ambivalence toward egypt. under u.s. law, the administration is required to withhold 15 percent, or $195 million, of the $1.3 billion it gives egypt annually in fmf funds unless it can certify that cairo is making progress on advancing human rights and democracy. however, the administration can issue a national security waiver that allows the funds to go through. this year, the administration again decided it could not certify egyptian progress on rights and it chose to issue the national security waiver but it is still going to withhold the $195 million. that money will now go into an account where it will be held pending egyptian improvement on human rights and democracy. this means that egypt could eventually get the money if its record on democracy and civil liberties improved.  strengthened security cooperation with egypt is important to u.s. national security,  said one source, adding that u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson felt  it was in the interests of the u.s. to exercise the waiver.   we remain concerned about egypt s lack of progress in key areas, including human rights and the new ngo law,  the source said.  egyptian rights activists have said they face the worst crackdown in their history under sisi, accusing him of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 arab spring uprising that ended hosni mubarak s 30 year rule. egyptian lawmakers have said the ngo law was needed to protect national security. the egyptian government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos, and several are facing investigation over their funding.

" donald trump flew all night from new york to scotland to talk about his renovated turnberry golf course and, given the chance to open up on the topic, he was rhapsodic. at a news conference, the republican’s opening ode to turnberry was what greeted american cable tv viewers as they woke to the news that britain had voted to part ways with the european union. the presumptive republican presidential nominee talked plenty about the “brexit” vote.  but since his event was to mark the reopening of a resort where the open championship has been staged four times, he first reviewed the improvements at holes 9, 10 and 11, the sprinkler system, the lighthouse, the resort hotel, and he name checked golf legends tom watson, jack nicklaus and nick price. “this hole is an example,” said trump, standing on the 9th tee. “from approximately this area, you would hit over there ... now you’re hitting out over the ocean. and just to the right of the lighthouse, you have a green, and a lot of people think this will be the greatest par 3 anywhere in the world. and then 10 becomes a par 5,” he said. trump quickly dispensed with a protester who emerged from the audience to hold up a package of red golf balls emblazoned with nazi swastikas. “get him out of here,” trump said, a refrain that he frequently uses when protesters are escorted by security from his rallies back home. more appreciated by trump were the two bagpipers in kilts who accompanied him. everyone at his event knew he was about to arrive because they could hear the skirling of the pipes before he appeared from behind a grassy hill. “we’re just waiting on donald trump. his arrival is imminent. we can see the bagpipers,” said one tv broadcaster. having never held public office, trump does not have a list of political victories to tout on the campaign trail. with his business skills, trump says, he can work to improve america’s rundown roads and bridges and negotiate better deals on issues as diverse as trade and iran’s nuclear program. trump delights in talking about his projects. his makeover of washington’s old post office into a luxury trump hotel, for example, is way ahead of schedule. he is less enthusiastic about raising money for his campaign and the republican national committee. “i don’t like doing it,” he said. but true to his nature, trump averred he was good at it. “you know, i sit with 20 people, and we talk, and they all hand you checks, bing, bing, bing,” he said.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on monday he would present options on afghanistan to president donald trump “very soon,” adding the strategy would take a regional approach rather than looking at the war torn country in isolation. the situation in afghanistan, which u.s. military officials acknowledge is in a stalemate almost 16 years since the war started, has deteriorated in recent months. a truck bomb explosion in kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the afghan capital since the ouster of the taliban in 2001. in some cases, afghan security forces have been forced to abandon more scattered and rural bases, and the government can claim to control or influence only 57 percent of the country, according to u.s. military estimates earlier this year. “we are taking a regional approach to this,” mattis told the house armed services committee.  “we will take that forward to the president for a decision very soon.” mattis said a request by general john nicholson, the head of u.s. and international forces in afghanistan, for additional troops would mostly be made up of troops who would train, advise and assist afghan forces, potentially putting them with afghan forces at the brigade level.  “it’s a fundamental change to how we bring our, what i would call our real superiority, in terms of air support,” mattis said.  at the same hearing, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph dunford said he had gone to mattis and trump with “some options that might be considered” in order to help improve the security situation in afghanistan. reuters reported in late april that trump’s administration was carrying out a review of afghanistan and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 u.s. and coalition troops there. deliberations include giving more authorities to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against taliban fighters.  some u.s. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. to date, more than 2,300 americans have been killed and over 17,000 wounded.  on saturday, three u.s. soldiers were killed when an afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern afghanistan.

" the united nations mission in afghanistan said at least 10 civilians may have been killed by an air strike in the northern city of kunduz last week, despite a u.s. military investigation that found no civilian deaths. in a series of messages on twitter, the u.n. assistance mission in afghanistan said interviews with multiple survivors, medics, elders and others gave it strong reason to believe that civilians were among the victims of saturday s attack.  credible reports that at least 10 civilians killed in kunduz afghanistan air strike 4 nov, unama initial findings show,  it said. the statement contradicts comments from some local and afghan military officials as well as a u.s. statement on tuesday which said that an investigation had found no evidence of civilian deaths. the episode underlines the lack of clarity over reports of civilian casualties, an issue which is likely to become increasingly prominent as the united states steps up air strikes against the taliban and other insurgent groups. captain tom gresback, a spokesman for the u.s. military, said the pentagon still stood by its previous statement that found no civilian deaths. but he added:  u.s. forces afghanistan will examine and consider any credible evidence when allegations of civilian casualties are presented. we take all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously and take necessary steps to ensure that we mitigate the loss of civilian life.    on a visit to kabul in september, u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said that commanders would be given greater freedom to use american firepower against the taliban but that  everything humanly possible  would be done to avoid civilian casualties. former president hamid karzai, who clashed bitterly with the united states over the issue in past years, condemned the air strikes but the government of president ashraf ghani has so far made no public comment.  accounts from some local officials and residents indicated that as many as 13 people were killed in air strikes in chahardara district outside kunduz city. some afghan media have reported much higher figures, without independent confirmation. afghan special forces and the local provincial governor say 48 militants were killed but deny any civilians were killed. in its most recent report, the united nations said there had been a 52 percent increase in civilian casualties from air strikes in the first nine months of the year to 205 killed and 261 wounded. the issue has particular resonance in kunduz because it was there that 42 civilians were killed in a u.s. air strike on a hospital run by medical aid group medecins sans frontieres during fighting to regain the city from the taliban in 2015.

" every time china s ruling communist party convenes a major gathering, like the congress that just ended in beijing, the list of delegates is hand crafted in part to burnish the party s image as  representative of the masses    including giving some prominence to those in more menial jobs and ethnic minorities. yet one group is chronically under represented among the political elite: women. the founding father of communist china, mao zedong, may have once said that women  hold up half the sky  but when the twice a decade party congress selected a new batch of top leaders this week, females weren t holding up much at all. no women made it onto the elite politburo standing committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of the party. none ever have. in the new politburo, only one of its 25 members is a woman   sun chunlan, head of the party body charged with outreach to non communists. it is her second term and she is likely to retire in five years. on the previous politburo, there were two women, sun and vice premier liu yandong   who is past retirement age and has stepped down from the politburo. one rung down, just 4.9 percent of the new central committee, a mere 10 of the body s 204 members, are women. that number was unchanged from the outgoing central committee, which presided for five years, but lower than in 2007 2012 when there were 13. the state council information office, which doubles as the party s propaganda department, did not respond to faxed questions for comment on why there are so few women in senior party positions. by way of comparison, five members of u.s. president donald trump s 24 member cabinet are women, and about 20 percent of the u.s. congress are female. in japan, two out of 20 members of the cabinet are women as are about 10 percent of the lower house lawmakers newly elected on sunday. at the chinese party congress itself, the overall numbers were stronger: about a quarter of its 2,287 delegates were women   roughly commensurate with the proportion in the roughly 90 million member party. but with most senior leadership posts in the hands of men, activist xiong jing, an ngo project manager who edits a feminist social media site, said many of the women delegates to the party congress were there merely as  decoration .  this problem is a clich ,  she said.  with the political system as it is now, i think even if more women were involved, whether as party congress delegates or in government, they may be very limited in what they can do.  the party takes the appearance of representativeness seriously when it comes to some groups. at party congresses and annual sessions of parliament, there are delegates from china s 56 different ethnic groups, every branch of the military and police, private businesses, the state sector and, of course, the government. the party congress this year featured delegates who were astronauts, athletes, actors, judges, farmers and more. there was even a delegate representing housekeepers, who showed up in her apron and maid s cap. for women in general in china, political empowerment is lacking. china ranked 74th in political empowerment of women out of 144 countries in the world economic forum s global gender gap report last year. in 2006, it was no. 52 out of 115. leta hong fincher, a new york based sociologist and author of the forthcoming book  betraying big brother: the rise of china s feminist resistance , says women in china are losing ground amid a resurgence of traditional gender norms.  it s my impression that the communist party is fundamentally not interested in having women at the senior levels at all,  she said. in china s pre reform command economy under mao, women were drafted into the workforce and recruited into nation building. the most powerful woman since the communist takeover in 1949 was mao s third wife, jiang qing. she and members of her  gang of four  were arrested after mao s death in 1976 and blamed for the excesses of the chaotic cultural revolution. more recently, hong fincher says, the party has been spooked by china s demographic challenges   an aging population, shrinking labor force and falling birth rates   and has aggressively promoted the idea that women should be getting married and having babies. to be sure, in chinese business there are some prominent female chief executives, such as zhang xin at real estate developer soho china and zhou qunfei, the billionaire founder of lens technology. and the party and government pay lip service to gender equality. the state constitution guarantees women the same rights as men.  the government ... wants to appear to be taking gender equality seriously, when in reality it is not. it is actually in full retreat with regard to gender equality,  hong fincher said. the election process for party congress delegates is tightly controlled, with candidates vetted for their loyalty to the party and leadership. but congress delegate tang jialing, who is a crew member on a deep sea research submersible, suggested that the lack of women reflected the will of the people.  we are the party of the people. it s the people who voted in more

" former cia director james woolsey, a vocal advocate of the 2003 u.s. led invasion of iraq who promoted allegations that saddam hussein harbored illegal weapons, will serve as a senior national security adviser to republican presidential candidate donald trump, the campaign announced on monday. woolsey’s hiring contrasted with trump’s repeated assertions that he was a stalwart opponent of the invasion, although he initially supported it. in the announcement, woolsey said he supports trump’s plan to expand the u.s. military, which calls for ending pentagon budget caps and spending billions of dollars for additional troops, ships and aircraft. “mr. trump’s commitment to reversing the harmful defense budget cuts signed into law by the current administration, while acknowledging the need for debt reduction, is an essential step toward reinstating the united states’ primacy in the conventional and digital battlespace,” woolsey said. woolsey, who served for two years as cia chief under then president bill clinton, also criticized the presence of classified information in emails stored on democratic candidate hillary clinton’s private server. in an appearance on cnn, however, he called trump’s plan to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states “a bad decision.” he also has warned about the threats posed by climate change, something trump has called a hoax that benefits china. woolsey was an outspoken proponent of the iraq invasion, suggesting that saddam was hiding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs from u.n. inspectors. he also promoted the erroneous allegation that the iraqi dictator backed al qaida’s sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the united states. shortly after former president george w. bush took office in 2001, woolsey visited britain on a defense department trip in a fruitless hunt for evidence that saddam masterminded the 1993 attack on the world trade center in new york. he made a second visit to britain for the same purpose shortly after sept. 11, and again came up empty. at the time of his second trip, woolsey was a member of the defense policy board, a panel of outside advisers to the defense department that advocated saddam’s overthrow even in the absence of any evidence of his complicity in 9/11. the following year, he arranged for the defense intelligence agency to debrief an iraqi defector who claimed that iraq had mobile biological warfare laboratories disguised as yogurt and milk trucks. the man was later determined to be a fabricator. in 2000, woolsey briefly served as a corporate officer of a foundation that managed u.s. funding for the iraqi national congress, the exile group that produced a series of defectors who peddled false information to bolster the allegations that saddam was hiding illicit weapons programs. no such weapons or facilities have ever been found.

" the united states could impose additional penalties on four unidentified countries that do not cooperate with requests to return their citizens, a department of homeland security (dhs) spokesman said wednesday. the state department and the dhs can sanction countries that do not cooperate with removals, but has only used that punishment authority twice in the past 15 years. the current 12 countries deemed recalcitrant are china, cuba, vietnam, laos, iran, cambodia, myanmar, morocco, hong kong, south sudan, guinea and eritrea. acting dhs secretary elaine duke sent a letter to the state department last week identifying the latest four countries that could face the new penalties. dhs spokesman david lapan declined to discuss possible sanctions or the names of the four countries that could face additional sanctions, including denying visas. however, cnn cited a dhs official close to discussions about the deliberations as saying on wednesday the four under consideration were cambodia, eritrea, guinea and sierra leone. in two cases since 2000, the united states halted issuing visas to government officials and their families to guinea and gambia. lapan said in some cases the dhs has no choice but to release some convicted criminals who served prison time but could not be returned to their home country because their home country refuses to cooperate. “we have tens of thousands of individuals,” lapan said.  the dhs identifies countries that can be sanctioned and the state department decides what, if any, sanctions could be imposed. the dhs has said that it has final deportation orders against 35,000 cuban citizens that have criminal histories that cuba refuses to accept.

" president donald trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive u.s. responses to iran s forces, its shi ite muslim proxies in iraq and syria, and its support for militant groups, according to six current and former u.s. officials. the proposal was prepared by defense secretary jim mattis, secretary of state rex tillerson, national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and other top officials, and presented to trump at a national security council meeting on friday, the sources said. it could be agreed and made public before the end of september, two of the sources said. all of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because trump has yet to act on it. in contrast to detailed instructions handed down by president barack obama and some of his predecessors, trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for u.s. policy but leave it to u.s. military commanders, diplomats and other u.s. officials to implement the plan, said a senior administration official.  whatever we end up with, we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible,  the official added. the white house declined to comment. the plan is intended to increase the pressure on tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants, several sources said.  i would call it a broad strategy for the range of iranian malign activities: financial materials, support for terror, destabilization in the region, especially syria and iraq and yemen,  said another senior administration official.    the proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation, the official said. the administration is still debating a new stance on a 2015 agreement, sealed by obama, to curb iran s nuclear weapons program. the draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if iran violates the 2015 agreement. the proposal includes more aggressive u.s. interceptions of iranian arms shipments such as those to houthi rebels in yemen and palestinian groups in gaza and egypt s sinai, a current official and a knowledgeable former u.s. official said. the plan also recommends the united states react more aggressively in bahrain, whose sunni muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority shi ites, who are demanding reforms, the sources said. in addition, u.s. naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the islamic revolutionary guard corps, iran s paramilitary and espionage contingent, three of the sources said. u.s. ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off irgc boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for 35 percent of the world s seaborne petroleum exports. u.s. commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered. the sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules, which are classified. the plan does not include an escalation of u.s. military activity in syria and iraq. trump s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to iranian proxies in syria and iraq would complicate the u.s. led fight against islamic state, which they argued should remain the top priority, four of the sources said. mattis and mcmaster, as well as the heads of the u.s. central command and u.s. special forces command, have opposed allowing u.s. commanders in syria and iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the irgc, hezbollah and other iranian backed shi ite militias, the four sources said. the advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert u.s. forces from defeating the remnants of islamic state, they said. moreover, looser rules could embroil the united states in a conflict with iran while u.s. forces remain overstretched, and trump has authorized a small troop increase for afghanistan, said one senior administration official. a former u.s. official said hezbollah and iranian backed shi ite militias in iraq have been  very helpful  in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that islamic state declared in syria and iran in 2014. u.s. troops supporting kurdish and sunni arab fighters battling islamic state in syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by iranian backed forces. in some of the most notable cases, u.s. aircraft shot down two iranian made drones in june. both were justified as defensive acts narrowly tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. trump s opposition to the 2015 iran nuclear deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), poses a dilemma for policymakers. most of his national security aides favor remaining in the pact, as do u.s. allies israel and saudi arabia despite their reservations about iran s adherence to the agreement, said u.s. officials involved in the discussions.  the main issue for us was to get the president not to discard the jcpoa. but he had very strong feelings, backed by (u.s. ambassador to the united nations) nikki haley, that they should be more aggressive with iran,  one of the two u.s. officials said.  almost all the strategies presented to him were ones that tried to preserve the jcpoa but lean forward on these other (issues.)

" president donald trump and republican leaders in congress will soon confront a complex challenge for tax reform: how to limit u.s. corporate tax avoidance schemes that take advantage of low tax rates in foreign countries. congressional and administration staff have begun to examine options to address profit shifting schemes that include so called transfer pricing, earnings stripping and tax inversions.  a decision on how to handle these in tax legislation could come before congress leaves town for its one week july 4 recess on june 29, officials and lobbyists said. lawmakers say the current tax code incentivizes profit shifting overseas because of the high 35 percent u.s. corporate income tax rate and rules that allow companies to hold profits abroad tax free until returned to u.s. soil. without effective measures against tax avoidance, experts and lobbyists said tax legislation could trigger a new exodus of income and assets abroad. because trump and republicans in congress also want to end u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, companies could eliminate their u.s. tax bills altogether without restrictions.   tax reduction strategies have been employed for decades by companies including microsoft corp (msft.o), apple inc (aapl.o) and amazon.com inc (amzn.o). independent analysts estimate the federal government misses out on more than $100 billion a year in corporate tax revenues as a result of tax reduction maneuvers. that is equal to one third of the $300 billion in annual corporate tax revenues. many schemes seek lower corporate tax bills through “transfer pricing”   using transactions between business units to shift income abroad. the shift often coincides with the transfer of intangible assets such as intellectual property to low tax nations where companies can expect single digit tax rates.   last week, senate finance committee democrats asked treasury secretary steven mnuchin to leave in place regulations adopted under president barack obama to combat earnings stripping and tax inversions. companies use earnings stripping to shift income abroad as tax deductible interest payments to foreign affiliates. inversions are international mergers in which u.s. companies move their headquarters to foreign countries with low taxes, if only on paper, to lower their u.s. tax bills. companies have accumulated some $2.6 trillion in abroad, equivalent to more than three quarters of the $3.3 trillion in annual government receipts expected this year. border adjustment tax but the most effective measures against corporate tax avoidance schemes, including house speaker paul ryan’s controversial border adjustment tax, or bat, have proved unpopular, raising the possibility that tax legislation could simply cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent to reduce the advantages offered by foreign tax havens. aside from bat, which taxes imports but not exports, tax reform discussions are also looking at a minimum tax on profits from tax havens, a tax on intangible income and other measures to discourage companies from shifting profits to low tax countries where they do little actual business, according to aides and lobbyists. lobbyists said none of the options have enjoyed consensus support in congress. meanwhile, the idea of a simple rate cut does not sit well with house republican leaders.   “even with a low rate, we’ll continue to see u.s. jobs and research and headquarters move overseas,” said house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady, a leading bat proponent. experts warn that the 15 percent rate sought by trump is well above a 5 percent effective rate that some corporations pay in countries like ireland, the netherlands and luxembourg. brady and ryan are expected to address the issue in coming weeks with mnuchin, white house economic adviser gary cohn, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch. the six are trying to forge legislation that could be unveiled as early as september. trump has pledged the biggest tax overhaul since ronald reagan. but republican infighting over healthcare has delayed the timetable.

" musa bihi abdi of the ruling kulmiye party was declared the winner of somaliland s presidential election on tuesday, by the election commission of the breakaway region. situated at the northern tip of east africa on the gulf of aden   one of the busiest trade routes in the world   somaliland broke away from somalia in 1991 and has been relatively peaceful since. the region of 4 million people has not been internationally recognized but it has recently drawn in sizeable investments from the gulf. in the election, abdi won just over 55 percent of the vote, while opposition leader abdirahman iro took nearly 41 percent, election commission chairman iman warsame said. turnout was 80 percent. in a debate before last week s vote, abdi pledged to boost women s participation in politics and introduce compulsory national service for high school and university graduates. there was no immediate comment from iro, whose opposition party waddani had accused kulmiye of vote rigging although it has not given evidence. a u.k. government funded international observer mission said the poll  preserved the integrity of the electoral process  and concluded irregularities were limited and did not undermine the vote. the former british protectorate broke away from somalia in 1991 following a bloody civil war. the poll had originally been scheduled for 2015 but was delayed by political spats and severe drought. analysts say the region enjoys strong ties with neighboring ethiopia and djibouti as well as its growing investment from the gulf. earlier this year the government agreed to let the united arab emirates establish a military base in its port of berbera. that came after dubai s dp world last year signed a 30 year concession to develop the same port that will require an investment of $440 million. the company is pouring further funds into a project connecting the port to landlocked ethiopia. this month dp world said it would also develop an economic zone in the region.

" donald trump’s pick to lead the pentagon put russia at the top of a list of threats to u.s. interests on thursday and told congress that america must be ready to confront moscow where necessary, even as he backed trump’s bid for better relations.  the remarks by retired marine general james mattis were the latest by one of trump’s cabinet picks that veered away from the president elect’s campaign rhetoric, which included praise for russian president vladimir putin and pledges to improve ties with him.  secretary of state nominee rex tillerson on wednesday also  expressed views at odds with trump on key foreign policy issues like nuclear proliferation, trade deals, climate change and relations with mexico. mattis said russia, china and islamist militants were presenting the biggest challenge to the u.s. led world order since world war two, and called for congress to lift spending caps undermining military readiness.  “i’m all for engagement but we also have to recognize reality in what russia is up to,” mattis said, adding there were a “decreasing number of areas” where the united states might cooperate with moscow.  asked about the main threats to u.s. interests, mattis said: “i would consider the principle threats to start with russia.”  mattis said he wanted to meet with the new trump national security team to “craft a strategy to confront russia for what it’s done,” when questioned about the possibility of new u.s. sanctions. due to enter the white house in eight days, trump on wednesday acknowledged that russia likely hacked the democratic national committee and emails of top democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign, a conclusion reached by u.s. spy agencies. mattis cited russian involvement in hacking and information warfare among the challenges posed by moscow. others include treaty violations, destabilizing activities abroad and “alarming messages from moscow regarding the use of nuclear weapons.”  he also accused russia of trying to undermine nato. unlike trump, who appeared to question the alliance during his campaign, mattis strongly embraced it — calling nato central to america’s defense. “we recognize that he (putin) is trying to break the north atlantic alliance,” mattis said. senator john mccain, the republican chairman of the committee, said he “could not be happier” about mattis’ nomination. he warned sternly against optimism about engaging with putin. “putin wants to be our enemy. he needs us as his enemy. he will never be our partner,” mccain exclaimed. mattis also singled out china for its activities in the south china sea, where it has been building man made islands with anti aircraft and anti missile batteries. together with russian activities and the threats of islamist extremists, mattis said china was part of mounting assault on global stability, and the relationship with beijing needed to be carefully managed. “i think it (the world order) is under the biggest attack since world war two, sir, and that is from russia, from terrorist groups, and with what china is doing in the south china sea,” he said. mattis railed against defense spending caps imposed by congress and, when pressed, said he did not believe the u.s. military was strong enough to properly deter potential adversaries. mattis, who retired from the military in 2013, is technically ineligible for the job since he has not been a civilian for at least seven years. that means congress would need to grant him a waiver, something it has not done since 1950, but appears inclined to do now.  after mattis’ testimony, the waiver cleared its first hurdle in congress when the senate armed services committee approved it. the full senate later backed the waiver by an overwhelming 81 17 vote, reflecting the strong support mattis enjoys in congress. mark cancian, a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies, said he expected bipartisan support for mattis would help him overcome limited opposition. “the other thing he has going for him is that he may be a restraint on some of trump’s more extreme impulses,” cancian said.  mattis, 66, has tried to persuade trump privately against the use of waterboarding, which simulates drowning, as an interrogation tactic. top u.s. officials, many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture.   trump’s pick for cia director took a similar line during his confirmation hearing on thursday, saying he would stand firm if necessary against trump on the issue of so called enhanced interrogation techniques.     mattis was fiercely critical of iran, cautioning that tehran’s “malign influence” in the region was growing. “iran is the biggest destabilizing force in the middle east and its policies are contrary to our interests,” mattis said in written responses to the committee. still, mattis did not echo trump’s campaign threat to rip up a nuclear deal between iran and world powers, under which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. mattis said the deal was imperfect but that the united states should uphold it.  “when america gives our word, we have to live up to it,” mattis said.

" suspected members of islamist militant group boko haram took over a town in the restive state of borno in northeast nigeria  on saturday, residents said. the attack comes days after a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people at a mosque in neighbouring adamawa state in one of the deadliest attacks since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end the eight year insurgency.  residents said attackers entered magumeri, around 50 km (30 miles) from borno state capital maiduguri, around 7:00 p.m. (1800 gmt). they said the insurgents shot sporadically and threw explosive devices, prompting locals to flee to a forest.   we hurriedly took our families to the bushes before they could get us. almost every resident is hiding here,  said wakil bulama, one of two residents who spoke to reuters by telephone.  a military source who did not want to be identified said magumeri had been attacked but could not confirm whether it had been seized.  boko haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern nigeria since 2009 in its attempt to create an islamic state in the region. the group has killed more than 20,000 and forced around 2 million people to flee their homes.

" russia will keep a naval and an air base in syria capable of carrying out strikes against insurgents if required after a partial military pull out announced by president vladimir putin, the kremlin said on tuesday. putin on monday ordered  a significant part  of moscow s military contingent to start pulling out of syria, declaring their work largely done.  putin made the announcement during a surprise visit to the russian hmeymim air base, where he met president bashar al assad and addressed russian forces.  thanks to the fact that the operation to save syria and the liberation of syrian land from terrorists have been completed, there is no longer a need for broad scale combat strength,  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said. but he added that russia would keep the hmeymim air base in syria s latakia province and its naval facility in the port of tartous.  the president stressed that the terrorists might try to  walk tall  again in syria. if that happens, crushing blows will be carried out,  peskov said. russia s military operation in syria, which began in september 2015, turned the tide of the conflict in favor of moscow s ally, assad. it also established russia as a power broker in the middle east, regaining a role it had relinquished after the collapse of the soviet union. assad s opponents, western governments and some human rights organizations alleged that russian air strikes on syria had killed large numbers of civilians. moscow has denied the allegation. the kremlin has presented the partial withdrawal of its forces as evidence that its mission in syria has been largely accomplished. that gives a boost to putin as he launches his campaign for re election. opinion polls show that he will comfortably win the presidential election, scheduled for march. but the kremlin fears that, since some voters see the election as a foregone conclusion, they may not turn out, weakening putin s mandate. russia had previously announced a partial drawdown of its forces in syria, in march last year. however, a powerful russian contingent remained in place and there was little sign of operations being scaled back. back home in russia, many people consider the syrian mission a successful operation to restore peace   as well as an opportunity for moscow to flex its military muscles. the official death for russian forces killed in combat is 38, according to a reuters tally. that is far below the level of losses sustained when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in the 1980s, the last time moscow waged a major campaign far beyond its borders. however, many of the losses in syria were borne by private military contractors working with the russian military whose deaths have not been officially acknowledged, according to friends, relatives and colleagues of the contractors.  the russian defense ministry denies that there are any russian contractors in syria.

" hungry, destitute and scared, thousands of new rohingya refugees crossed the border into bangladesh from myanmar early on monday, reuters witnesses said, fleeing hunger and attacks by buddhist mobs that the united nations has called ethnic cleansing. wading through waist deep water with children strapped to their sides, the refugees told reuters they had walked through bushes and forded monsoon swollen streams for days. a seemingly never ending flow entered bangladesh near the village of palongkhali. many were injured, with the elderly carried on makeshift stretchers, while women balanced household items, such as pots, rice sacks and clothing, on their heads.  we couldn t step out of the house for the last month because the military were looting people,  said mohammad shoaib, 29, who wore a yellow vest and balanced jute bags of food and aluminum pots on a bamboo pole.  they started firing on the village. so we escaped into another.  day by day, things kept getting worse, so we started moving towards bangladesh. before we left, i went back near my village to see my house, and the entire village was burnt down,  shoaib added. they joined about 536,000 rohingya muslims who have fled myanmar since aug. 25, when coordinated rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labeled the militants from the arakan rohingya salvation army who launched the attacks as terrorists, who have killed civilians and burnt villages. the european union said on monday it would suspend invitations to myanmar s army commander in chief and other senior generals  in the light of the disproportionate use of force carried out by the security forces . a statement issued after a meeting of eu foreign ministers also called for thorough investigation of  credible allegations of serious human rights violations and abuses . not everyone made it to bangladesh alive on monday. several kilometers (miles) to the south of palongkhali, a boat carrying scores of refugees sank at dawn, killing at least 12 and leaving 35 missing. there were 21 survivors, bangladesh authorities said.  so far 12 bodies, including six children and four women, have been recovered,  said police official moinuddin khan. bangladesh border guards told reuters the boat sank because it was overloaded with refugees, who pay exorbitant fees to cross the naf river, a natural border with myanmar in the cox s bazar region of bangladesh. the sinking came about a week after another boat capsized in the estuary on the river, which has become a graveyard for dozens of muslim refugees. refugees who survived the perilous journey said they were driven out by hunger because food markets in myanmar s western rakhine state have been shut and aid deliveries restricted. they also reported attacks by the military and rakhine buddhist mobs. the influx will worsen the unprecedented humanitarian emergency unfolding in cox s bazar, where aid workers are battling to provide refugees with food, clean water and shelter.   on monday, the red cross opened a field hospital as big as two football fields, with 60 beds, three wards, an operating theater, a delivery suite with maternity ward and a psychosocial support unit. hundreds of thousands of rohingya had already been in bangladesh after fleeing previous spasms of violence in myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced curbs on their movements and access to basic services. monday s eu move to shun further contacts with myanmar s army top brass comes after officials told reuters the european bloc and the united states were considering targeted sanctions against military leaders.  the action announced by brussels is largely symbolic, though the eu said it may consider further measures. western governments, who have invested politically in myanmar s democratic transition, are wary of doing anything that would hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between civilian leader aung san suu kyi and the military. the powerful army chief, min aung hlaing, told the united states ambassador in myanmar last week that the exodus of rohingya, whom he called non native  bengalis , was exaggerated. but despite myanmar s denials and assurances that aid was on its way to the north of violence torn rakhine state, thousands more starving people were desperate to leave.  we fled from our home because we had nothing to eat in my village,  said jarhni ahlong, a 28 year old rohingya man from the southern region of buthidaung, who had been stranded on the myanmar side of the naf for a week, waiting to cross. from the thousands gathered there awaiting an opportunity to escape, about 400 paid roughly $50 each to flee on nine or 10 boats on monday morning, he added.  i think if we go to bangladesh we can get food,  he said.

" the united states is committed to helping iraq recover from three years of war against islamic state despite president donald trump cutting the foreign aid budget, a senior official in its main government aid agency has said. thomas staal, the counselor of the u.s. agency for international development (usaid), said the agency would continue to provide basic humanitarian services and additional support for minority groups such as psychosocial support to those who suffered genocide, slavery, and gender based violence.  the budget that the president submitted included a 30 percent cut, but for iraq actually we are looking at additional funding, especially for the victims of islamic state,  staal told reuters in an interview at the u.s. embassy in baghdad. trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of u.s. tax dollars. the white house proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third. iraqi prime minister haider al abadi declared final victory over islamic state on saturday after iraqi forces drove the last remnants of the group from the country, three years after the militants captured about a third of iraq s territory. the war has had a devastating impact on the areas previously controlled by the militants. about 3.2 million people remain displaced, the united nations says.  the last estimate by abadi put the cost of post war reconstruction at $50 billion, a figure calculated before iraqi forces retook mosul, which severely damaged the biggest city in northern iraq. the u.s. government has provided nearly $1.7 billion in humanitarian assistance for iraq since the islamic state takeover of the north in 2014, staal said. that includes a total of $265 million donated to the united nations development programme s iraq stabilization fund in 2016 and 2017. usaid has asked undp to focus on the minority areas, said staal, who met with christian and yazidi leaders during a five day visit to iraq.  the primary request from everybody was security,  said staal, who also met with two young women who were sold into slavery by islamic state fighters. in 2014, more than 3,000 yezidis were killed by islamic state in what the united nations described as a genocidal campaign. others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight. iraq is exempted from trump s policy of cutting aid because of the especially  terrible plight  experienced by islamic state s victims, staal said, but it was a short term focus.  the long term solution is that the iraqi government is going to have to provide services to people in a more effective, efficient way,  he said. usaid is working directly with iraqi ministries to train staff and improve efficiency, with procurement reform high up on the agenda, staal said.  corruption is rife in all levels of government in iraq, which in 2016 ranked 166 out of 176 countries in transparency international s corruption perception index. abadi has repeatedly said that once islamic state was beaten, fighting corruption would be his next focus.

" the united nations urged sudan to end violence and human rights abuses against the 2.6 million people displaced by its long conflict in darfur, a u.n. report documenting the abuses said on tuesday. conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab led government.  progress on resolving the conflict was a key demand made by the united states before it lifted 20 year sanctions last month that had long isolated the country. sudan said last month that it would extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels that has been in place since october 2016 until the end of december. the u.n. report found that  despite a ceasefire between the government and various armed opposition groups ... violence against internally displaced people continues to be widespread and impunity for human rights violations persists.   i urge the government to address fundamental issues that are preventing the return of displaced people, such as continued violence, including from armed militias, which raise continuing and justifiable fears for their safety and the lack of basic services that leave them dependent on aid,  u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said in a statement.  people displaced by the conflict face  outright absence of law enforcement and judicial institutions  and  serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law,  the statement said.

" u.s. president barack obama called german chancellor angela merkel an “outstanding” ally on thursday and said she might get his support if he were a german citizen and she decided to run for a fourth term as leader of europe’s largest economy. merkel, whom many expect to stand again, declined to show her hand, despite obama’s words of support. she said she would announce her decision at the appropriate moment, but “that is not today”.  “chancellor merkel has been an outstanding partner,” obama told reporters in berlin when asked if he wanted her to run again, praising her integrity and their shared core values.  merkel told a joint news conference that it was difficult to say goodbye to obama after their close partnership over the past eight years. “the parting is hard for me,” she said, before adding that the u.s. constitution limited a president’s time in office to a maximum of eight years and that she had to accept this. obama smiled at journalists and winked. he said merkel faced “big burdens” if she chose to run again. “i wish i could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she is tough.” merkel, in power since 2005, is expected to announce on sunday whether she will run for chancellor again in next year’s federal election, the redaktionsnetzwerk deutschland media group reported on wednesday. close merkel aides have said she is moving toward another run, and one lawmaker in her conservative party this week told cnn that she would definitely put herself forward. a poll conducted for german broadcaster ard, released on thursday, showed merkel’s conservatives would get 32 percent of the vote if the elections were held on sunday, down one percentage point from a poll taken on nov. 3. the center left social democrats, junior partner in her  “grand coalition,” would get 23 percent, up one percentage point from the last poll, while the pro environment greens would get 13 percent, also up one point, the poll conducted by infratest dimap showed. the anti immigrant alternative for germany (afd) party dropped one percentage point to 12 percent.

" pope francis lamented the decay and degradation of rome on friday, using a traditional prayer on a national feast day to highlight problems such as environmental blight and corruption in the italian capital. francis made his comments at the base of rome s famed spanish steps, where each year popes pay homage to a statue of the madonna on the feast of the immaculate conception. rome has fallen into disrepair and degradation in recent years, with streets full of pot holes, piles of garbage and neglected public gardens where weeds grow as tall as a person. francis, who is also bishop of rome, prayed that the residents of the city develop  antibodies against some viruses of our times . those he listed included  resignation to environmental and ethical degradation,   civic incivility,   contempt for the common good,  and fear of immigrants. in july, two leaders of a crime ring that plundered rome city coffers were convicted along with some 40 politicians, officials and businessmen, at the end of one of the biggest corruption trials in the italian capital. gang members were accused of infiltrating rome city hall and using bribery and intimidation to get their hands on lucrative public contracts, including those for the running of centers housing immigrants who have flooded into italy from africa. on friday, the pope spoke of the need to help  so many people who have emigrated here from places of war and hunger . the investigation of the crime ring laid bare systemic corruption in the city as politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen hooked up with lowlife criminals to rig public tenders. the corruption was seen as the one of the causes of the recent disrepair and degradation, which has received widespread cover in the foreign media, blemishing the city s appeal as a tourist destination.

" a country long divided by sectarian conflicts, lebanon has found a rare point of unity since saad al hariri s shock resignation as prime minister: lebanese of all stripes want him to come back from saudi arabia and to continue his work as premier. hariri left beirut for riyadh on nov. 3 and resigned the following day in a speech that caught even his closest aides off guard. he cited fear of assassination and blamed iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah for sowing strife in the arab world. the lebanese authorities believe saudi arabia forced hariri to resign and is holding him against his will, say top lebanese state officials and politicians close to hariri. while some in lebanon believe hariri s decision was his own and blame iran and hezbollah for the crisis, many others, including some of his longtime supporters, think he was forced to quit. billboards and posters demanding his return have gone up across beirut.  we want our pm back,  declared a huge billboard near the beirut waterfront. runners in the annual beirut marathon on sunday echoed the demand. some wore t shirts printed with hariri s face and the message:  we re all waiting for you.   this year, there are definitely many telling him  we are waiting for you , and god willing he will come back safe and sound,  may al khalil, the founder and president of the beirut marathon association, said. hariri ran in the beirut marathon last year, shortly after he was installed as prime minister of a coalition government that generated hope of stability after years of political tension and paralysis.     thousands of runners turned out, defying security concerns that have grown since hariri resigned and saudi arabia declared both lebanon and hezbollah as hostile parties.  sheikh saad al hariri represents all lebanese people,  said beirut mayor jamal itani, wearing a cap that read  running for you . lebanese wanted hariri  to return as prime minister , he said. saudi arabia has denied reports hariri, a long time ally of riyadh, is being held against his will and coerced into resigning. it says he is a free man and quit because hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. ashraf rifi, a hawkish sunni politician who is fiercely critical of hezbollah and iran, has welcomed hariri s resignation, saying  it pulled the official cover away from iran s project in lebanon .  tension between hariri and hezbollah has been a defining feature of lebanese politics since the 2005 assassination of his father, rafik al hariri. a u.n. backed tribunal has charged five hezbollah members over the killing. hezbollah denies any role. but hariri has twice set aside his differences with hezbollah to lead coalition governments including the group.   we all love him, even those who weren t sympathetic to him are now sympathetic, because as you know he s the prime minister of all of lebanon, not just prime minister for us sunnis,  said yousef saad al deen, 40.  no one is allowed to decide for us, neither who our president is nor who we will elect,  he added, speaking in the staunchly pro hariri beirut neighborhood of tariq al jdideh, where newly erected posters pledged loyalty to hariri. munir khatib, a man in his late 60s, said iran was to blame.  he is not being held, as they are saying,  he said.  hezbollah, the strongest group in lebanon thanks to its vast arsenal, has declared saudi arabia s detention of hariri as an insult to all lebanese. at a rally on friday, hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said he must return. the future movement, hariri s political party, also says hariri must come back to lebanon, calling him a national leader whose presence is vital to upholding the lebanese system. it has also taken aim at criticism of saudi arabia, on saturday rejecting  campaigns targeting  the kingdom. lebanon, which fought a civil war from 1975 90, is governed according to a carefully balanced system that parcels out the state along sectarian lines. many say now is the time for unity.  the war had taught us that if we don t have our ranks united and on the same ground, the country cannot succeed,  said arlette dakkash, a resident of beirut.

" if you ever wondered how to say  fake news  in latin, it s  nuntii fallaces    and pope francis is writing a document on just that. francis announced it himself in a tweet to his nearly 40 million followers on friday, saying the theme of his message for the roman catholic church s next world day of social communications will be  the truth will set you free. fake news and journalism for peace.  in latin, one of the nine languages the pope uses to tweet, that would be  veritas liberavit vos. nuntii fallaces et diurniariorum opus ad pacem.  a vatican statement said the issue was important enough for the pope to address because  fake news contributes to generating and nurturing a strong polarisation of opinions.  a distortion of facts, it said, can have  repercussions at the level of individual and collective behaviour.  francis said in an interview last year that media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement. the vatican statement said the leader of the 1.2 billion member church wanted to offer  a reflection on the causes, the logic and the consequences of disinformation in the media, and helping to promote professional journalism, which always seeks the truth . the church s next world day of social communications will be celebrated on may 13. the pope s message will be released on january 24, feast of st francis de sales, the patron of journalists.

" a federal judge in wisconsin dealt the first legal blow to president donald trump’s revised travel ban on friday, barring enforcement of the policy to deny u.s. entry to the wife and child of a syrian refugee already granted asylum in the united states. the temporary restraining order, granted by u.s. district judge william conley in madison, applies only to the family of the syrian refugee, who brought the case anonymously to protect the identities of his wife and daughter, still living in the war torn syrian city of aleppo. but it represents the first of several challenges brought against trump’s newly amended executive order, issued on march 6 and due to go into effect on march 16, to draw a court ruling in opposition to its enforcement. conley, chief judge of the federal court in wisconsin’s western district and an appointee of former president barack obama, concluded the plaintiff “has presented some likelihood of success on the merits” of his case and that his family faces “significant risk of irreparable harm” if forced to remain in syria. the plaintiff, a sunni muslim, fled syria to the united states in 2014 to “escape near certain death” at the hands of sectarian military forces fighting the syrian government in aleppo, according to his lawsuit.  he subsequently obtained asylum for his wife and their only surviving child, a daughter, and their application had cleared the security vetting process and was headed for final processing when it was halted by trump’s original travel ban on jan. 27. that executive order sought to ban admission to the united states of citizens from seven muslim majority countries   iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria, yemen and iraq   for 120 days and to suspend entry of all refugees indefinitely.  the original travel ban, which caused widespread chaos and protests at airports when first implemented, was rescinded after the state of washington won a nationwide federal court order blocking further enforcement of the policy. the modified executive order reduced the number of excluded counties   removing iraq from the list   and lifted the indefinite refugee travel ban for syrians. but opponents from several states have gone to court seeking to halt its implementation as well. “the court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order,” conley wrote in his decision. “as the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.” in a related development on friday, the federal judge in seattle who imposed a nationwide injunction on enforcement of the original travel ban refused a request to apply that order to the revised policy, saying that lawyers from states opposed to the measure needed to file more extensive court papers.

" an ohio judge ruled friday teenagers celebrating their 18th birthday before november’s election are entitled to have their votes for presidential nominees counted in next week’s state primary. “plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment that the secretary abused his discretion,” franklin county common pleas judge richard frye said in his ruling about ohio secretary of state jon husted. husted reversed an earlier decision to appeal, saying he would not after hearing the case would only be heard a day before the election, leaving the state little time to properly carry out the election. “even if we were to prevail, there is no effective way to responsibly make the changes necessary to implement an orderly election,” he said. nine teenagers from across the state claimed in a lawsuit this week that hustle’s interpretation of state law that eliminated their voting rights was incorrect.  the judge said his decision affected “potentially thousands of other 17 year old voters still eager to participate at next week’s primary election.” he said no secretary of state between 1981 and 2012 had ever adopted the reading of state law he was now overturning. husted in december modified the state’s election manual to say 17 year olds are allowed only to nominate candidates but are prohibited from voting for presidential delegates because they are elected, not nominated, according to the lawsuit. the teenagers argued husted’s interpretation contradicts state law and a previous ruling by the state supreme court that allows 17 year olds who will be 18 by the election to vote in primaries. alexis brossart, a 17 year old student at milford high school outside cincinnati, was excited to vote until she got a letter last week saying she could not pick a presidential nominee. “i registered in february. ever since february, i’ve been excited to vote,” brossart told reuters. the attorney for the nine teenagers said they were galvanized when they heard their votes would not count. “it has caused them to think about their voting rights and get more engaged in the process,” rachel bloomekatz said. a similar lawsuit filed in federal court by the campaign of democrat presidential contender bernie sanders was halted on friday when u.s. district magistrate judge elizabeth preston deavers stayed the matter until the state court finding.  in the ohio primary, 66 delegates are at stake for the republicans and 159 for the democrats.

" president donald trump told congress on tuesday that more needs to be done to bring down “artificially high” prices for prescription drugs, while at the same time praising a drug that turns out to cost $300,000 per year. during the televised address, trump acknowledged in the audience megan crowley, a college student who has pompe disease   a rare muscle disorder that can be treated with an expensive enzyme replacement therapy.  “but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved megan’s life, from reaching those in need,” the president said. “if we slash the restraints, not just at the fda but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like megan.” trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging “astronomical” prices, while acknowledging how “complicated” the nation’s healthcare system is. representatives of the trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for pompe disease is fair.  trump’s comments on tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors   the potential for deregulation of the fda, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products. “i think trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,” said dr. aaron kesselheim, a researcher at harvard medical school. “the fda’s standards actually promote innovation because patients don’t want just any old drug   they want drugs that work.” megan’s father, john crowley, now chief executive at amicus therapeutics inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for pompe disease.  in 2006, the fda   after a nine month review   approved infused enzyme replacement therapy myozyme for patients born with the condition. a similar drug, lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late onset pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient’s age.  the average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to paris based sanofi sa, which now owns the drugs. under the orphan drug act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases   defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients   are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity.    “pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don’t for mainstream diseases,” said joel hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the university of southern california. the national organization for rare disorders (nord) applauded trump’s recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.     “our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,” nord said in a statement on wednesday.      pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. when glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death. nord estimates that around 30 million americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.

" hurricane irma has caused  enormous devastation  to the dutch side of the caribbean island of saint martin and cut off electricity and gas, dutch prime minister mark rutte said on thursday. most communications with the outside world are being conducted via the military, he said, adding that there was  no clarity  on victims. the dutch navy, which has two ships stationed off the coast of the island, tweeted images gathered by helicopter showing damaged houses, hotels and boats. french authorities have counted at least eight dead on the french side of the island.  dutch interior minister ronald plasterk said he briefly had contact with saint martin s prime minister but communications are sporadic. he said nine patients at a hospital in the country had been evacuated by dutch military helicopter. sint maarten is an independent nation within the kingdom of the netherlands, with a population of around 40,000   about the same as the french side. images of the country s juliana airport showed the landing strips appeared intact, though the navy said the airport is  unreachable  for now. andre van der kamp, commander of the dutch ship zeeland, tweeted that the zeeland and pelikaan would be trying to moor on sint maarten to deliver emergency aid on thursday, but they needed to complete a safety check of the port first.

" u.s. president barack obama’s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor donald trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. due to take office on jan. 20, trump, the winner in tuesday’s election, campaigned at times to dismantle obama’s nuclear deal with iran and to reimpose sanctions obama eased on cuba. trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way obama has deployed troops abroad to combat islamist militant groups. in his most notable foreign policy achievements, obama, a democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a republican controlled congress committed to blocking his agenda. the u.s. constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. both republican and democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. “he (obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,” said thomas wright, director of the project on international order and strategy at the brookings institution.  “that is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a trump administration,” wright said. obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to democrat hillary clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to trump, a republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  often contradicting himself during the campaign, trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. trump said in an october speech that he would “cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by president obama” on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. a trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on thursday on his latest plans. perhaps nowhere has obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with iran, which republicans and some democrats said put too few restrictions on iran’s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. a president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. “anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,” said zachary goldman, a former u.s. treasury official now at new york university. obama drew enough support from democrats to block a republican led resolution rejecting the iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  trump will have the added advantage of working with a u.s. senate and a house of representatives controlled by fellow republicans. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he hoped trump would “see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.” breaking with longstanding u.s. policy on another issue, obama restored diplomatic ties with cuba in 2015. but facing opposition in congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from republicans, he used executive actions to ease some u.s. sanctions. obama capped his cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  “presidential policy directive,” which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement, people to people exchanges, and greater u.s. business ties. trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. obama’s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for u.s. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any republican president to reverse the opening to cuba. trump could roll back obama’s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. obama issued an executive order in july requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. as commander in chief, trump will wield the power to mobilize the u.s. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from congress. obama deployed u.s. troops to iraq, syria and libya to help fight the islamic state militant group by relying on the authority congress granted president george w. bush to battle al qaeda. that same authority would allow trump to ramp up u.s. deployments in fights against islamist militants if he chose to do so. one former u.s. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in congress once the operation is under way. trump’s powers, however, are limited. he pledged to expand the army, grow the marine corps, boost the navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of air force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. for starters, that would require that congress scrap government spending caps under the budget control act. trump’s support for water boarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other “extreme interrogation techniques” widely considered torture. obama signed the measure into law last november.

" egypt s court of cassation upheld a five year jail sentence against prominent opposition activist alaa abdel fattah on wednesday, judicial sources said, a final ruling that cannot be appealed. abdel fattah, who has already served more than three years in prison, was jailed for protesting without permission in breach of a 2013 law that rights groups say effectively bans protests. the blogger and software engineer was a leading voice amongst the tech savvy liberal youth who initially led the 2011 uprising that ended the 30 year rule of hosni mubarak. he is one of several activists jailed since the military overthrew islamist president mohamed mursi in 2013 after mass protests and cracked down on his muslim brotherhood movement and secular democracy activists. the government has proscribed the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist organization but denies it has cracked down on secular democracy activists. prosecutors said abdel fattah was guilty of organizing a protest in november 2013 because he had promoted it on social media. rights groups say authorities were only able to prosecute abdel fattah, who did not attend the protest, by invoking a century old law of assembly that institutes collective punishment for all those involved in an illegal gathering.     they say the 1914 era law was in fact repealed in 1928 and courts should not be using it. they have sued the president over its use but there has been no response from the government. abdel fattah is also on trial in a separate case where he is accused of insulting the judiciary, a charge that carries up to three years in jail. a verdict is scheduled for december. egyptian rights activists say they face the worst crackdown in history under general turned president abdel fattah al sisi, who they accuse of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising. sisi, seen in the west as a bulwark against extremism in the region, has urged his critics to not judge egypt s rights records by western standards, saying security and economic prosperity are also human rights.

" u.s. interior secretary ryan zinke said on thursday he has sent recommendations from his review of more than two dozen national monuments to president donald trump, indicating that some could be scaled back to allow for more hunting and fishing and economic development. the recommendations follow a 120 day study of 27 national monuments across the country, created by presidents since 1996, that trump ordered in april as part of his broader effort to increase development on federal lands. the review has cheered energy, mining, ranching and timber advocates but has drawn widespread criticism and threats of lawsuits from conservation groups and the outdoor recreation industry. there were fears that zinke would recommend the outright elimination of some of the monuments on the list, but on thursday, speaking to the associated press in billings, montana, he said he will not recommend eliminating any. zinke said in a statement that the recommendations would “provide a much needed change for the local communities who border and rely on these lands for hunting and fishing, economic development, traditional uses, and recreation.” he did not specify which monuments he plans to recommend be scaled back. the associated press reported that zinke said he would recommend changing the boundaries for a “handful” of sites. zinke has already announced a recommendation to shrink the size of one site under review, the 1.35 million acre bears ears national monument in utah created by former president barack obama late last year. in the last few weeks, zinke has said that six monuments, including the upper missouri river breaks in his home state of montana, would be left intact. “the report is a draft, so we are continuing to work with interior on getting the best information on which to base recommendations” for trump, a white house official said. “once we have a final report, in the coming weeks, we will make it public.”  timing for the public release of the recommendations has not been set. trump has argued that previous administrations abused their right to create monuments under the antiquities act of 1906 by putting huge areas, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging, ranching and other activities without adequate input from locals.  the law enables a president to declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument if “confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”  (graphic on review of monuments:  tmsnrt.rs/2itkqfd) a designation as a national monument is permanent, and prohibits mining and sets stringent protections for ecosystems on the site. the designation offers more permanent protection than other federal designations like national wilderness or conservation areas. no president has ever revoked a previous designation but a few have reduced the size of some monuments. conservation groups and the growing outdoor retail industry launched public campaigns over the last few weeks to urge zinke to leave the monuments intact, and they vowed to challenge him in court.  “any recommendation from secretary zinke to shrink national monuments is hypocritical at best and ruinous at worst,” said michael brune, director of the sierra club. one republican congressman from utah, rob bishop, chairman of the house of representatives natural resources committee, said he had not yet seen the full report but was briefed on some aspects of it by zinke. he said his committee would eventually take up legislation to carry out some of zinke’s recommendations and may attempt to reform the antiquities act. “if we don’t do reform of the antiquities act, we will have failures in the future,” he said.

" forty former u.s. diplomats and national security officials urged secretary of state rex tillerson not to eliminate the state department office that handles refugees in a letter seen by reuters on monday. the letter argued that a trump administration proposal to transfer the responsibilities of the bureau of population, refugees and migration (prm) to other agencies would undercut u.s. diplomatic leverage in grappling with foreign crises. among the retired officials who signed the letter were former deputy secretary of state william burns, former under secretaries of state for political affairs nicholas burns and wendy sherman and former middle east peace envoy dennis ross. “whether in iraq, afghanistan, kenya, turkey or south sudan, the department of state’s efforts to address humanitarian crises must include the tightest coordination of diplomatic engagement and emergency assistance,” the letter, which was also signed by 18 executives with non governmental aid agencies, said. “we are convinced that the elimination of prm’s assistance functions would have profound and negative implications for the secretary of state’s capacity to influence policy issues of key concern to the united states,” the letter said. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said tillerson “has no preconceived notions about the outcome of the transformation process he has begun at the state department.” she added that tillerson viewed the work of both the bureau of consular affairs and the prm as “essential to the department’s mission to secure our borders and protect the american people.” a memo to the office of management and budget seen by reuters proposes giving prm’s responsibility for the u.s. refugee admission program, which helps resettle refugees in the united states, to the department of homeland security. the memo, which was first reported by cnn on june 30 and which a former official said was prepared by the white house’s domestic policy council, proposes transferring its other responsibilities elsewhere and eliminating the bureau. the memo and the letter from the former officials appear to be part of a wider struggle over refugee and immigration policy. this includes executive orders signed by president donald trump and challenged in court temporarily banning most refugees and most citizens from some muslim majority countries from entering, an internal debate over the cost of resettling refugees and a crackdown on illegal immigration. the issue may come up at a senate foreign relations committee hearing at 5 p.m. (2100 gmt) on monday where deputy secretary of state john sullivan is scheduled to testify about the state department’s reorganization plans.

" a detailed version of president donald trump’s budget to be released in may will lay out plans to eventually erase u.s. deficits, white house budget director mick mulvaney said on sunday. “we’re getting into that now. by may, i think it’s mid may we’re shooting for right now, we’ll have that larger budget...” mulvaney said on nbc’s “meet the press” program. mulvaney acknowledged that the budget would not be balanced in the upcoming 2018 fiscal year but said the administration wants to put the country on a path toward eventually wiping out annual deficits. “we won’t be able to balance the budget this year, but we’re working on trying to get it to balance within the 10 year budget window, which is what republicans in the house and the senate have traditionally done in the last couple of years,” mulvaney said. “it is a very complicated budget process when your entitlements, your mandatory spending is driving most of your budget deficit,” he said. “so over the course of the next decade, we’ll have to look at the mandatory spending side in order to figure out a way to make changes to the way we spend money.” the full budget to be rolled out in may will put “more flesh on the bones” of trump’s preliminary budget plan that was released last week, said mulvaney, director of the white house office of management and budget. trump’s initial budget outline prompted criticism from both democrats and some republicans for its proposals for steep cuts in domestic programs such as education and environmental enforcement programs as well as foreign aid. as a presidential candidate, trump campaigned on a pledge to quickly balance the budget, and eliminate federal debt during his presidency. mulvaney said trump’s proposals to boost u.s. infrastructure could be ready to be issued around “summer or early fall.” he said some money had been taken out of the budget blueprint “with the intention of putting it back into the infrastructure bill.” ",0
" former fbi director james comey’s testimony that u.s. president donald trump expected loyalty and hoped comey would drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against trump, several legal experts said.  such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the u.s. house of representatives, which is controlled by trump’s fellow republicans. according to written testimony posted on the senate intelligence committee’s website on wednesday, comey said trump told him during a one on one feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser michael flynn was a “good guy” and hoped that comey could see his “way clear” to letting go a probe into ties between flynn and russia. trump had fired flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the russian ambassador to the united states.  comey’s account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on thursday, could show that trump intended to impede the flynn investigation, said michael gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the university of north carolina school of law.  “the express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting,” and could heighten speculation that the “president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the russia investigation,” gerhardt said. comey, who was fired by trump on may 9, was leading an fbi investigation of flynn as it looks into allegations of links between russia and trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. moscow and trump have both denied any collusion. trump’s lawyer, marc kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a reuters query about whether comey’s testimony would support an obstruction case. but he said in a statement that trump felt “vindicated” by comey’s confirmation he was not under investigation in any russia probe.     to build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with “corrupt” intent. it does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation.  while a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment.  bruce green, a professor at fordham university school of law, said it would be difficult to show trump intended to impede the flynn investigation. he said trump could say he was merely vouching for flynn’s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president. alan dershowitz, a professor emeritus at harvard law school and well known defense lawyer, added that trump’s comments to comey were “ambiguous statements” and “not even close to obstruction of justice.”  other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the feb. 14 conversation could indicate that trump intended to interfere with the flynn probe.   according to comey, trump told his close advisers, including attorney general jeff sessions and jared kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to comey privately. “asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” said andrew wright, a professor of constitutional law at savannah law school. wright said there were other damaging details in comey’s testimony, including that comey did not document his conversations with former president barack obama but “felt compelled” to do so after his first conversation with trump. comey’s testimony does “maximum damage” to trump, wright said. gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to trump, saying: “some people who weren’t concerned before should be concerned now.”  ",0
" president donald trump may tap u.s. energy secretary rick perry to replace former homeland security secretary john kelly, who took over as white house chief of staff this week, bloomberg news reported on wednesday. bloomberg, citing three people familiar with deliberations, said others were also being considered for the post. white house officials had no immediate comment. asked about the bloomberg report, an energy department spokeswoman said perry was content in his current job. “while secretary perry is honored to be mentioned, he is happy where he is and very focused on carrying out the mission the president gave him when he was chosen to lead the department of energy,” shaylyn hynes said in an email. on friday, an official at the department of homeland security (dhs) said republican u.s. representative michael mccaul, who chairs the house homeland security committee, was among those being considered to replace kelly.  the department is currently being run by homeland security deputy secretary elaine duke. on friday, trump replaced his beleaguered white house chief of staff, reince priebus, after only six months on the job, installing kelly, a retired four star marine corps general, in his place in a major shake up of his top team.   hired to bring more discipline to the white house, kelly took up his new post on monday. kelly’s tenure at dhs was marked by a drop in attempted southern border crossings and a crackdown on illegal immigrants with criminal records, with a focus on gangs.

" the united states provided intelligence to russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bomb attack in st. petersburg, u.s. and russian officials said on sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries. russian president vladimir putin telephoned u.s. president donald trump on sunday to thank him for the tip off, which the kremlin said helped prevent a militant bomb attack on a cathedral in the russian city, as well as other sites. the white house did not disclose details about the plot itself, but said the attack  could have killed large numbers of people.  neither the kremlin nor the white house identified the would be attackers. the u.s. warning allowed russian law enforcement agencies to arrest the suspects before they could carry out their plans, the white house and kremlin said. relations between washington and moscow have been damaged by disagreements over the wars in ukraine and syria, although trump pledged during his election campaign to pursue better ties with moscow.  that has been complicated by u.s. allegations   denied by russia   that the kremlin meddled in last year s u.s. presidential election to help trump win. russian officials say putin believes trump is not to blame for the tensions.  the phone call on sunday between trump and putin was at least the second such call in the past week. on thursday, putin and trump discussed the crisis in north korea. the foiled attack was to have been carried out on kazansky cathedral, in russia s second city of st. petersburg, and on other locations in the city where large numbers of people gather, the kremlin statement said. the cathedral is a popular tourist site. the white house seized on the foiled plot in st. petersburg as a sign of what moscow and washington could do if they cooperate.  both leaders agreed that this serves as an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together,  the white house said, adding trump appreciated the call from putin.     russian media reported last week that the federal security service had detained followers of the islamic state group who had been planning a suicide bomb attack on kazansky cathedral on saturday.  the u.s. central intelligence agency and the office of the director of national intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the foiled plot. putin said russia would alert u.s. authorities if it received information about any attack being planned on the united states, the kremlin said. russia has repeatedly been the target of attacks by islamist militant groups, including an attack in april that killed 14 people when an explosion tore through a train carriage in a metro tunnel in st. petersburg. russian police detained several suspects in that attack from mainly muslim states in ex soviet central asia.

" germany s foreign minister said on saturday that he had been disappointed by british prime minister theresa may s brexit speech, adding to a downbeat reception from france ahead of the resumption of brexit negotiations next week.  we heard nothing concrete. it is time for the government of great britain to clearly state under what conditions it wants to leave the european union,  sigmar gabriel told reporters in the northern german city of wolfenbuettel.  in a speech in the italian city of florence on friday, may set out a plan to retain full access to the eu s single market for two years after brexit, to try to reassure business and reset the tone of stalled negotiations with brussels. shortly afterwards, french president emmanuel macron said there was still not enough clarity on rules for european union citizens living in britain, the divorce bill it would pay, and how the land border with ireland will work.  if these three points are not clarified, we will not be able to advance on the rest,  macron said. france, germany and other eu countries are insisting that britain reach a deal with the bloc on the terms of its divorce before moving on to negotiate its future trading relationship. on saturday, gabriel said the eu would not back away from its demand for britain to pay some 60 100 billion euros ($72 120 billion) for the divorce, adding that he continued to view britons  decision to leave the eu as a huge mistake.  the conservatives in britain didn t tell their citizens the truth about the consequences, and that is why they seem to be unable to present a clear strategy,  he said.  we need clarity from the british government, and no conflict within the british government between the foreign minister and the prime minister. we re running out of time.  britain is due to formally leave the bloc in march 2019. gabriel, a social democrat, said britain had refused to answer the eu s key questions on issues such as its financial obligations under the eu budget, adding:  thank god, the eu is more unified than ever before.  a leading member of merkel s conservatives also criticized may s address.  theresa may s speech underscores the will of london to move ahead with brexit negotiations, but unfortunately it will not provide a new dynamism in the talks that is so urgently needed,  michael stuebgen, european spokesman for the conservatives in the german parliament, said in a statement. he also said may had failed to address the issue of future borders, especially in ireland.  on this basis, we can hardly expect the needed progress in the brexit negotiations before the european council meeting in october,  he said. the eu s chief brexit negotiator, michel barnier, said on friday that may s speech showed  a willingness to move forward , but that he wanted to hear a  precise negotiating position  when he meets his british counterpart on monday.  the head of the german association of small and medium sized businesses (bvmw), mario ohoven, said may had wasted an opportunity for a new beginning in the brexit negotiations.  what german industry needs above all is planning and investment certainty,  he said in a statement.  looming customs duties and bureaucratic trade obstacles are exactly the opposite of that, and are already resulting in significant damage to the investment climate.

" michigan governor rick snyder has asked president barack obama to declare both an emergency and an expedited major disaster in the county where the city of flint has been dealing with the fallout from lead contaminated drinking water. snyder said on late thursday that he requested federal aid in genesee county to protect the safety of flint residents. earlier this week, he sent the michigan national guard to distribute bottled water and other supplies. the financially strapped city was under control of a state appointed emergency manager when it switched its source of tap water from detroit’s system to the nearby flint river in april 2014 to save money. flint, which is about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of detroit, returned to using that city’s water in october after tests found elevated levels of lead in the water and in the blood of some children. the more corrosive water from the flint river leached lead from the city pipes more than detroit water did, leading to the problems. “i am asking president obama to provide additional resources,” snyder said thursday.  on friday, michigan attorney general bill schuette said he would investigate whether any laws were violated in the crisis. “no one should have to fear something as basic as turning on the kitchen faucet.” the assistance snyder has requested could include grants for temporary housing, home repairs and other needs. the federal emergency management agency will review the request and advise obama. the white house said on friday it would consider snyder’s request. a fema spokesman said the agency will give its recommendation to the president as soon as possible. several michigan members of congress on friday urged obama to provide the aid. also on friday, a bipartisan group of leaders on the house energy and commerce committee sent a letter to the environmental protection agency requesting a briefing “in the coming days” on the flint crisis. some flint residents sued snyder, other officials, michigan and the city on jan. 7 in genesee county court, seeking class action status covering all residents. other flint residents late last year filed a federal lawsuit. genesee county also has seen a spike of legionnaires’ disease resulting in 10 deaths that may be related to the water crisis, state officials previously said. snyder said on friday he supports the return of more executive powers to flint mayor karen weaver. since the city is in receivership, a city administrator is currently responsible for day to day operations.

" a judge on tuesday tossed out a legal challenge to a problem plagued presidential preference election in arizona, ruling that the woes at the polls were not due to fraud. maricopa county superior court judge david gass said there were insufficient grounds for granting the request to void the results of the march 22 nominating election, which was marked by long lines and controversy.  in a ruling from the bench, gass said there were glitches and possible missteps by election officials but that the results would not have changed. “elections are human endeavors. they are never, ever perfect,” gass said. “glitches are always something that we need to wary of and we need to work hard, and we need to fix them.... but they don’t rise to the level of fraud.” gass issued his verbal decision following a two day hearing on the lawsuit brought by tucson resident john brakey, who alleged that election officials committed misconduct. the lawsuit argued officials improperly handled voter registration requests and permitted illegal votes to be cast in the election. he also said erroneous ballots were counted and the number of polling locations were inadequate. he sought a repeat of the election, easily won by democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump. brakey’s attorney michael kielsky told reuters on tuesday night that he was disappointed in the ruling, but that it likely will not be appealed. the election brought widespread criticism to arizona, which saw frustrated voters wait in line for as long as five hours to cast their ballots at a drastically reduced number of polls.  in a cost cutting move, county election officials slashed the polling locations to 60, compared with 200 in the election in 2012.  officials immediately took the blame for the mistake, saying the decision was based on past voter turnout and an increase in mail in votes. the election also faces a separate federal court challenge by the state and national democratic parties, along with the clinton and sanders campaigns. justice department officials additionally have launched a probe into the handling of the election.

" israel said on tuesday that the hezbollah guerrilla group, its most potent enemy in neighboring lebanon, had gained control over that country s u.s. sponsored conventional military, signaling both would be in israeli gunsights in any future war. defence minister avigdor lieberman s remarks were a hard tack from more measured recent israeli estimates that the lebanese army maintained autonomy even if some of its troops cooperated with the better armed, iranian aligned guerrillas. outlining potential threats in lebanon, where israel last fought a war against hezbollah in 2006, lieberman said in a speech:  we are no longer talking about hezbollah alone .   we are talking about hezbollah and the lebanese army, and to my regret this is the reality. the lebanese army has turned into an integral part of hezbollah s command structure. the lebanese army has lost its independence and become an inseparable part of the hezbollah apparatus,  lieberman said. there was no immediate response from lebanon, which is formally in a state of war with israel, nor from the u.s. embassies in beirut and tel aviv.  the lebanese army has previously said it operates independently from hezbollah, most recently during an operation against islamic state militants at the lebanese syrian border, during which the army said there was absolutely no coordination with hezbollah fighters who attacked is from the syrian side. hosting lebanese prime minister saad al hariri in july for aid talks, u.s. president donald trump praised beirut s efforts to stem the spread of islamic state and pledged continued help from washington.  america s assistance can help ensure that the lebanese army is the only defender lebanon needs,  trump said.     the pentagon said washington has provided lebanon with more than $1.5 billion in military assistance since 2006, and that    u.s. special forces have been providing  training and support  for the lebanese army since 2011.  strengthening the laf (lebanese armed forces) also advances a range of u.s. interests in the middle east that includes not only countering the spread of isis (islamic state) and other violent extremists but also stemming the influence of iran and hezbollah in the region,  pentagon spokesman eric pahon said. while welcoming u.s. action against islamic state, israel sees iran, hezbollah and their allies as the greater threat and worries about their entrenchment in syria as they help president bashar al assad beat back a more than six year old rebellion. lieberman said israel sought to avoid going to war again on its northern front, which, he predicted, would include syria.       in anything that transpires, it will be one theater, syria and lebanon together, hezbollah, the assad regime and all of the assad regime s collaborators,  he said.

" australia s foreign minister said on wednesday that asylum seekers occupying an abandoned australian run detention camp in papua new guinea (png) can relocate to alternative accommodation, challenging united nations claims that the substitute site is unfinished and inadequate. some 380 men have barricaded themselves into manus island center for more than 20 days without regular food or water supplies, defying attempts by australia and png to close the facility. the asylum seekers say they fear for their safety if moved to the transit center, and risk being resettled in png or another developing nation permanently.  there is accommodation that is perfectly acceptable,  australia s foreign minister, julie bishop, said in an interview with australian broadcasting corp radio on wednesday.  the stand off on manus island can be ended if the men ... move from the regional processing center to the alternative accommodation that is being offered.  mostly from afghanistan, iran, myanmar, pakistan, sri lanka and syria, the men are held under australia s strict  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores. the stand off has attracted the attention of the united nations, which is a long time critic of the conditions experienced by asylum seekers held in australia s offshore camps. nai jit lam, a regional representative for the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, told a u.n. briefing in geneva on tuesday that asylum seekers  are still not adequately provided for outside the center .  it s still under construction ... we saw for ourselves that they are trying to complete the site as quickly as possible but the fact remains that major work is still in progress,  lam said in a satellite phone call from manus island. australia says allowing asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores would only encourage people smugglers in asia and see more people risk their lives trying to make the perilous sea voyage. it rejected an offer from new zealand to resettle 150 of the men to focus on sending up to 1,250 asylum seekers to the united states. conditions at the abandoned facility are getting worse each day, according to lam, with rubbish and human waste building up and medical supplies already exhausted. papua new guinea s post courier newspaper reported on tuesday that immigration officials would begin evicting the men on wednesday, the fourth such deadline imposed on the refugees to leave since the camp s closure on oct. 31. papua new guinea s immigration department did not respond to a request for comment.

" south sudan s government has sought to disarm the bodyguards of detained former army chief paul malong on fears he might escape and launch a rebellion, his wife said on saturday, highlighting tensions within the leadership. malong   the man who has led president salva kiir s campaign against rebels   has been under house arrest since may after kiir sacked him following a string of military resignations by senior generals alleging abuses and ethnic bias. malong had initially fled the capital juba with a convoy of vehicles for his home state of aweil following his dismissal   raising fears he might join opposition forces, before returning to the capital. on saturday, his wife lucy ayak told reuters security officials arrived at their home late on friday with  specific orders  from kiir.  they came carrying the order from the president and told general malong that they had been ordered to disarm his bodyguards,  she said, adding that they also tried to take his phone and said his family members would not be allowed to visit.   the government is thinking that general malong might take the country back to war. the tension is still high ... we do not know if they might come back and arrest him by force if he resists.  residents in juba told reuters heavily armed soldiers have blocked the main road leading to his house.  media outlets from juba also reported that a senior commander in the army who is allied with malong has also defected with the aim of launching a rebellion. president kiir s press secretary ateny wek ateny declined to comment, saying the  issue was purely an army matter . south sudan won independence from sudan in 2011 but plunged into civil war in 2013 after kiir fired his deputy riek machar. the conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines, has pitched parts of the oil producing country into severe hunger, paralyzed public services and forced a quarter of the population   three million people   to flee their homes.

" pope francis, in a major speech on europe, on saturday urged the european union to  recover the sense of being a single community  if it wants a future of prosperity and fairness for all. francis spoke at the end of a two day conference at the vatican called  re thinking europe . dozens of participants attended, including european parliament president antonio tajani, the vice president of the european commission, frans timmermans, and religious leaders. while the pope did not specifically mention the situation in catalonia, where the region s leaders want to break away from spain, or britain s decision to leave the eu, he spoke often of solidarity, teamwork and mutual sacrifice.  a european union that, in facing its crises, fails to recover a sense of being a single community that sustains and assists its members   and not just a collection of small interest groups   would miss out not only on one of the greatest challenges of its history, but also on one of the greatest opportunities for its own future,  he said.  particular and nationalist agendas risk thwarting the courageous dreams of the founders of europe,  he said. in his long speech, francis appeared to warn against the dangers to europe posed by populist anti immigrant parties. in elections in germany in september, alternative for germany (afd) secured almost 13 percent of the vote, making it the third largest party and the first far right party to win seats in more than half a century.  extremist and populist groups are finding fertile ground in many countries; they make protest the heart of their political message, without offering the alternative of a constructive political project,  francis said, without naming any group. history s first latin american pope said politics had often gone astray, saying  sadly, all too often we see how politics is becoming instead a forum for clashes between opposing forces.  in his address to the pope at the closing ceremony, tajani, the european parliament president, spoke of  risk of a return to intolerance and xenophobia . the pope called for immigrants to be welcomed to europe as an enriching resource, rather than be seen as a threat. but, in an apparent assertion that immigration had to be controlled, he said that while authorities should have an  open heart  they should be able to  provide for the full integration, on the social, economic and political level  of newcomers.

" the investigative arm of congress has agreed to examine whether a panel that oversees foreign investment in the united states has the legal powers it needs to keep up with efforts by state owned firms in russia and china to buy strategic u.s. companies. the government accountability office said in a letter to lawmakers released on monday that it would begin the review in about four months once the staff with the needed expertise were cleared of other duties. the letter was dated sept. 30. the study is being initiated in response to a request on sept. 15 by 16 members of congress, who voiced concern that legislation governing the committee on foreign investment in the united states (cfius) has not been updated enough to ensure the panel can do its job effectively. “now is an opportune time for gao to review what has worked well, and where cfius authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state owned enterprises and state controlled enterprises from china and russia, among other designated countries,” the lawmakers said in their letter. the letter from the lawmakers noted that foreign investment oversight began as an executive order from the president and was only codified by congress in response to concerns about foreign ownership of defense industries and ports. the letter said lawmakers were now concerned about recent investments in the telecommunications, media and agriculture sectors that raised questions about “the degree to which foreign ownership ... may pose a strategic rather than overt national security threat.” it noted that chinese companies designated by beijing as “state champions” often benefited from illegal subsidies in order to gain strategic access to markets like the united states. the letter said congress had raised concerns about china national chemical corp’s (chemchina) cnncc.ul planned $43 billion acquisition of swiss agricultural seed and pesticides provider syngenta ag synn.s and to dalian wanda group’s bid for major american movie studios like legendary entertainment and paramount studios. it said the media acquisitions were particularly concerning because of “china’s efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on american media.” “these examples raise serious security questions about what authority cfius currently has, or may need to be added, to address these concerns,” the lawmakers said in their letter.

" a sweeping corruption case against a former mayor of pennsylvania’s capital city harrisburg ended on monday when he pleaded guilty to 20 counts of receiving stolen artifacts bought with public funds for a proposed museum that was never built in the city. former mayor stephen r. reed, 67, made the plea on the morning when jury selection in his trial was scheduled to begin in dauphin county court of common pleas. as part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped 94 other counts. reed, who was originally charged in 2015 with nearly 500 criminal counts, could receive up to nine months in prison under state sentencing guidelines when judge kevin hess sentences him on friday, although he may only get probation. many of the more serious charges, including bribery and siphoning money from bond issues, were dismissed last year on statute of limitations grounds.  “today’s guilty plea marks the final chapter in a case that has gone on for several years,” said deputy attorney general rebecca frantz. “this will help the city of harrisburg to move on.” reed, known as an avid private collector of civil war and american west memorabilia during his 28 years in office, pleaded guilty to illegal possession of 20 historical documents and photographs with a total value of more than $18,000.  the artifacts were among thousands acquired by reed with public funds for a proposed museum of the american west that he had hoped to build in financially strapped harrisburg. after his plea, reed told reporters he experienced “gut wrenching humiliation and embarrassment” over his arrest, after serving as harrisburg’s mayor for decades. he said many of the artifacts seized from his home and warehouse during a raid in 2015 were legally owned by him, but similar to ones acquired with public funds for the museum. he believes the 20 items in the plea were accidentally placed in boxes of his own papers after he hastily left office following his defeat in 2010, but acknowledged the packing was done under his supervision. “the precepts of my faith require that i take responsibility for this error, and that was my ultimate deciding factor in doing this plea,” reed said. a hearing is scheduled in march on reed’s petition for the return of artifacts he believes belong to him. frantz said prosecutors would oppose that request. harrisburg has been under state financial supervision since 2011, primarily because of cost overruns on an incinerator retrofit project.

" france demanded on wednesday an urgent u.n. security council session on human trafficking in libya and raised the possibility of sanctions on the country after a video appearing to show african migrants sold as slaves there sparked global outrage. convened by italy, which struck a deal with libya to slash the number of migrants reaching its shores, the council on tuesday unanimously backed a resolution urging tougher action to crack down on human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide. speaking to lawmakers, french foreign minister jean yves le drian suggested paris wanted to take things further and called for an urgent session of the council to specifically discuss the situation in libya.  libyan authorities, who have been alerted several times, including by myself because i was there in september, have decided to open an investigation into the facts,  le drian said.  we want it to go fast and if the libyan justice system can not carry this procedure through then we should open international sanctions,  le drian said. footage appearing to show african migrants sold as slaves in libya has sparked an international outcry with protests erupting across europe and africa, while artists to soccer stars to u.n. officials have made pleas for the abuse to end. the video broadcast by cnn showed what it said was an auction of men offered to libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400, a chilling echo of the trans saharan slave trade of centuries past.  what has been revealed is indeed trafficking of human beings, it s a crime against humanity,  macron said during a news conference with african union president alpha conde.  macron said he wanted the u.n. security council to discuss what concrete steps could be taken to tackle the issue. a french diplomat said the u.n. session would likely be in coming days, probably next week, and would see what concrete measures could be taken to improve the situation.  despite events in libya, conde put the blame firmly on the european union, accusing it of encouraging the libyans to keep migrants in the north african country despite there being no government.   what happened in libya is shocking, scandalous, but we must establish the responsibilities,  said conde.  in libya there is no government, so the european union can not choose a developing country and ask that country to detain refugees (...) when it doesn t have the means to do so,  he added.  the refugees are in terrible conditions ... so our european friends were not right to ask libya to keep the migrants. the european union is responsible.         le drian said he wanted the international organization for migration and the u.n. refugee agency to publish details about the trafficking of migrants in the country.  libya splintered along political, ideological and tribal lines during and after a 2011 nato backed uprising that unseated former leader muammar gaddafi. in 2014 a battle for the capital led to rival parliaments and governments being set up in tripoli and the east.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he hoped to see compromise immigration reform that combines border security measures with protections for immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children. president donald trump on tuesday ended a program for so called dreamers and gave congress six months to find a legislative fix. in a new york times interview on thursday, ryan was asked if he would put the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to a vote. “i’m going to put a consensus plan on the floor, because i want members of congress in both parties to talk to each other and find consensus on this issue.” ryan said the daca issue was a symptom of failure of security at u.s. borders. “it is only reasonable that while fixing this serious real problem, we also try to address the root cause of that problem. and that is border security,” he said. “that is where i think the consensus lies.” ",0
" doctors treating some of the 429,000 rohingya muslims who have fled to bangladesh from myanmar in recent weeks have seen dozens of women with injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks, u.n. clinicians and other health workers said. the medics  accounts, backed in some cases by medical notes reviewed by reuters, lend weight to repeated allegations, ranging from molestation to gang rape, leveled by women from the stateless minority group against myanmar s armed forces.  myanmar officials have mostly dismissed such allegations as militant propaganda designed to defame its military, which they say is engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations and under orders to protect civilians.  zaw htay, spokesman for myanmar s de facto leader aung san suu kyi, said the authorities would investigate any allegations brought to them.  those rape victim women should come to us,  he said.  we will give full security to them. we will investigate and we will take action.   suu kyi herself has not commented on the numerous allegations of sexual assault committed by the military against rohingya women made public since late last year.      violence erupted in myanmar s northwestern rakhine state following attacks on security forces by rohingya militants last october. further attacks on aug. 25 provoked a renewed military offensive the united nations has called  ethnic cleansing . reuters spoke with eight health and protection workers in bangladesh s cox s bazar district who between them said they had treated more than 25 individual rape cases since late august. the medics say they do not attempt to establish definitively what happened to their patients, but have seen an unmistakeable pattern in the stories and physical symptoms of dozens of women, who invariably say myanmar soldiers were the perpetrators. it is rare for u.n. doctors and aid agencies to speak about rape allegedly committed by a state s armed forces, given the sensitivity of the matter. doctors at a clinic run by the u.n s international organization for migration (iom) at the leda makeshift refugee say they treated hundreds of women with injuries they said were from violent sexual assaults during the army operation in october and november. there have been fewer rapes reported among the influx of refugees since august, said dr. niranta kumar, the clinic s health coordinator, but those they have seen have injuries suggesting  more aggressive  attacks on women. several health workers suggested that, whereas in october many women had initially remained in their villages believing the army sweeps were only targeting rohingya men, this time most had fled at the first sign of military activity. doctors at the leda clinic showed a reuters reporter three case files, without divulging the identity of the patients. one said a 20 year old woman was treated on sept. 10, seven days after she said she was raped by a soldier in myanmar. handwritten notes say she said soldiers had  pulled her hair  and a  gun used to beat her  before raping her. examinations often find injuries suggesting forced penetration, beating and even what looked like intentional cutting of the genitals, doctors said.  we found skin marks, it showed a very forceful attack, an inhuman attack,  said iom medical officer dr tasnuba nourin. she had seen incidents of vaginal tearing, bite marks and signs that seemed to show a firearm was used to penetrate women, she said. among the new influx of rohingya she had treated at least five women who appeared to have been recently raped, she said, adding that in each case the physical injuries observed were consistent with the patient s account of what had happened. at bangladesh government clinics supported by u.n. agencies in the ukhia area, doctors reported treating 19 women who had been raped, said dr. misbah uddin ahmed, head of the main health complex there, citing reports from female clinicians.  the evidence included bite marks, tearing of the vagina, these sorts of things,  he said. in one day alone, sept. 14, six women showed up at one of the clinics, all saying they were sexually assaulted.  they all said myanmar army had done this.  an iom doctor who asked not to be identified, working at one of those clinics near the kutapalong refugee camp, said a woman who crossed from myanmar in late august said she was raped by at least seven soldiers.  she was extremely weak and traumatized and said she struggled to make it to the clinic,  the doctor said.  she had a laceration on the vagina.  the doctor treated 15 of the 19 cases of women who appeared to have been raped, and another eight women who had been physically assaulted. some were given emergency contraceptives, and all were given treatment to reduce the risk of contracting hiv and jabs against hepatitis. symptoms included bite marks over the arms and back, tearing and laceration on the vagina and vaginal bleeding, the doctor said. internal reports compiled by aid agencies in cox s bazar recorded that 49  sgbv survivors  were identified in just four days between aug. 28 31. sgbv, or sexual and gender based violence is used to refer to only cases of rape, according to u.n. doctors. data for reported rape cases was not available for other dates. a situation report from aid agencies says more than 350 people had been referred for  life saving care  relating to gender based violence   a broad term that includes rape, attempted rape and molestation, as well as emotional abuse and denial of resources based on gender   since aug. 25. it did not refer to the perpetrators. kate white, emergency medical coordinator for m decins sans fronti res (msf) in cox s bazar said the charity had treated at least 23 cases of sexual and gender based violence including gang rape and sexual assault since aug. 25.  this is a fraction of the cases that are likely to be out there,  she said.  reuters first reported allegations of mass rape of rohingya women within days of militant attacks in northern rakhine in october. the same reports were also heard by u.n. investigators who visited bangladesh in january.  a report of the u.n. secretary general in april said the sexual assaults were  apparently employed systematically to humiliate and terrorize their community . before her rise to power last year suu kyi had spoken of rape being used as a tool of division in the country s myriad ethnic conflicts.   it is used as a weapon by armed forces to intimidate the ethnic nationalities and to divide our country, this is how i see it,  she said in 2011 in a video message to a conference on sexual violence in conflict. her spokesman zaw htay said there was  nothing to say  when asked if her view had changed since then.  everything should be according to the rule of law,  he said.  the military leaders also have said they will take action.

" the bodies of five argentine men killed in a truck attack in new york city last week arrived at their hometown of rosario on monday.  a police escort accompanied the bodies of the men as they were transported from buenos aires ezeiza international airport in a motorcade to rosario, argentina s third largest city. other officers on horseback saluted as the cars carrying the victims passed through the streets of buenos aires early in the morning. the motorcade reached a funeral home in rosario several hours later.  the victims are hern n ferruchi, diego enrique angelini, hern n diego mendoza and ariel erlij, all 48, and alejandro dami n pagnucco, 49.  the five, who were businessmen or architects, were among eight people killed on tuesday in the truck attack as they rode bicycles on a pedestrian path in lower manhattan along the hudson river. the argentines were part of a group of 10 friends who had traveled to new york to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation.  uzbek immigrant sayfullo saipov, 29, was charged in a federal court on wednesday with driving the truck down the bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists, in support of islamic state. argentine president mauricio macri and first lady juliana awada joined new york city mayor bill de blasio at the site of the attack on monday, where they laid flowers and paid tribute to the victims.  terrorism does not distinguish or limit countries, nor nationalities,  macri said.  argentines confirm that we want to be part of this battle, that we all have to give in this world to coexist in peace and with love.   macri is in new york for a previously planned trip to meet with investors and business executives.  de blasio said the five argentines  visit to new york was an affirmation about all that is good about life.   we live 5,000 miles apart, but we feel a tremendous sense of unity and a deep connection right now,  de blasio said. rosario mourned for three days after the deadly attack. the victims  high school, where administrators said lifelong friendships are common among students, is counseling students and observing a weeklong mourning period.   friendship moves the world,  said 65 year old rosario resident adriana sorzoli,  and i am very sad.

" the white house has narrowed its search for a u.s. supreme court nominee to three federal appeals court judges, sri srinivasan, merrick garland and paul watford, a source familiar with the selection process said on friday. srinivasan, an indian american who served under presidents of both parties before president barack obama named him as an appellate judge, and garland, considered but passed over for the supreme court twice before by obama, are considered the leading contenders, according to the source and two other sources close to the process. obama is searching for a replacement for long serving conservative justice antonin scalia, who died on feb. 13. senate republicans have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up or down vote on any nominee picked by the democratic president for the lifetime position on the court. senate republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the nov. 8 presidential election, want the next president, who takes office in january, to make the selection.  a formal announcement could come as soon as monday. that would give obama the weekend to think about his final choice and make an announcement before tuesday’s presidential primary elections in five states including florida and ohio. srinivasan, 49, and garland, 63, serve together on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. that appeals court has served as a springboard to the supreme court for several justices including scalia in recent decades. srinivasan, who was born in india and grew up in kansas, would be the first asian american and first hindu on the high court. obama appointed him to the appeals court in 2013. the senate confirmed him in a 97 0 vote. srinivasan served in the justice department under democratic and republican presidents and worked as a clerk to the first woman to serve on the supreme court, sandra day o’connor, a republican appointee. garland, who has earned praise from lawmakers of both parties, is the chief judge of the washington appeals court, where he has served since being appointed by democratic president bill clinton in 1997, winning confirmation in a 76 23 vote. prior to that, he served in the justice department under clinton. watford, 48, is a judge on the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, winning senate confirmation in a 61 34 vote in 2012. he previously worked as a prosecutor and in private practice. if confirmed, he would be the nation’s third black justice, following current justice clarence thomas, appointed in 1991, and thurgood marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. obama is the first black u.s. president. it was unclear whether the other two other candidates who had been expected to be interviewed by obama, federal appeals court judge jane kelly and federal trial judge ketanji brown jackson, were now out of the running altogether. kelly is a judge on the st. louis based 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals. jackson is a federal trial judge in washington. both were appointed to those positions by obama. without scalia, the supreme court is evenly split with four liberals and four conservatives. an obama appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. obama is traveling in texas, where he spoke at austin’s south by southwest festival on friday and is appearing at democratic fundraisers. he returns to washington late on saturday.

" in the run up to kenya s august presidential election, the ruling party used divisive social media campaigns created by a u.s. company whose previous clients include president donald trump, a britain based privacy advocacy group said on thursday. two websites   one detailing the accomplishments of president uhuru kenyatta and the other attacking opposition leader raila odinga   share an ip address with texas based harris media llc, according to privacy international s report. privacy international said the company used data analytics to target audiences using information gleaned from social media accounts in kenya, where 1,200 people were killed in inter ethnic violence after a disputed election a decade ago. kenyans vote largely along ethnic lines, and candidates appeal to voters on that basis.  this raises serious concerns about the role and responsibility of companies working for political campaigns in kenya, in which tribal affiliation and region of origin are particularly politically sensitive data, and volatile  coded language  was widely deployed,  privacy international said. social media in the east african nation were flooded with ads linking to the  real raila  and  uhuru for us  sites in the weeks before the aug. 26 vote. an official for kenyatta s jubilee party denied the report, saying it handled all its campaigns locally. the company, u.s. based harris media llc, did not respond to a request from reuters for comment on the report. but the allegations by privacy international recalled how, for the first time in kenya s history, social media including fake news, hashtags and trolls dominated the public discussion and stoked tensions in the run up to the hotly contested presidential election on aug. 26. kenyans went to the polls amid concerns over the credibility of the vote and bitter online hate campaigns stoking ethnic tensions, leading to fears of a return to the bloodshed that followed the disputed 2007 vote. the august vote was eventually nullified by the supreme court over irregularities. kenyatta won an october re run that odinga boycotted. but violence marred the extended election season, and more than 70 people were killed, mainly by police. raphael tuju, jubilee party secretary general, denied the party had hired or used harris media.  we have heard a lot of those kinds of accusations. we were running a campaign from the jubilee headquarters, and we employed local communications experts, led by our own team, and that is it for us,  he told reuters by phone. days before the august vote, facebook released a tool enabling kenyan users to evaluate content displayed prominently when they log on. the tool contained tips on how to spot fake news, including checking web addresses and looking for other reports on the topic.

" the new president of the world s largest humanitarian network, the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), promised on tuesday to crack down on corruption after a scandal over ebola funds in west africa. francesco rocca, who headed the italian red cross and oversaw its role in the mediterranean refugee crisis, was elected on monday to lead the ifrc. he said the organization should have  zero tolerance for any grey area or black hole  and its 190 national societies should adopt  very strict  policies.   what has happened could jeopardize our credibility,  rocca told reuters. last month the ifrc said it had uncovered fraud committed during its operations to combat the deadly ebola virus outbreak in guinea, liberia and sierra leone in 2014 2016.  the estimated losses totaled 6 million swiss francs, including suspected collusion between ifrc staff and bank employees in sierra leone, fake billing in guinea and inflated prices and payments in liberia.   it s a huge offense to our volunteers, who spend their lives and sacrifice their time (away from) their family, their friends, their free time, sometimes their job, to spend for humanity,  rocca said.  then someone is creating profit on their shoulders. it is something that is really unacceptable.  rocca said other priorities for the organization included recruiting more volunteers to help cope with bigger and more frequent natural disasters, and persuading politicians to take the right decisions. politicians were too concerned about the present and needed to think longer term to solve big problems, rocca said.  one such issue was the flow of migrants and refugees from africa to europe, thousands of whom die every year as they try to cross the sahara and the mediterranean.   if after 30 years people are still escaping for the same reason, perhaps we need to rethink how we have worked so far in that area of the world,  he said.

" republican candidate jeb bush was endorsed by former rival senator lindsey graham of south carolina on friday, winning an important ally in a state where a feb. 20 vote could prove critical in the 2016 race for a presidential nominee. the move by the hawkish graham, who ended his own presidential campaign on dec. 21, reflected his view that bush offered the best plan to defeat islamic state militants and to do so by forming alliances with muslim nations in the region. graham’s decision could be significant in swaying not only south carolina republican voters but also his good friend senator john mccain, the 2008 republican presidential nominee who remains an influential figure in the party and who has spoken warmly about bush in recent months. graham said the vote in south carolina, which will follow iowa’s caucuses on feb. 1 and new hampshire’s primary on feb. 9, will reset the race. “jeb bush is going to be a nominee that can win an election that as a party we can’t afford to lose. he will be the president that can reset the world, bring us together and solve hard problems,” graham said. in making his announcement, graham also said that a bush rival, florida senator marco rubio, was, at 44, too young to be president. rubio delivered a strong performance thursday night at a debate of the top seven republican candidates, an event that front runner donald trump was seen as winning. graham, 60, said he believed rubio would be president some day, but not following the nov. 8 election.  pointing to his own experience, he said at age 44: “i was not ready to be president.” stung by a series of ads against him from the bush campaign and the superpac that supports bush, rubio released a tv ad on friday, calling bush desperate. bush waved off the attacks, suggesting rubio has been too sensitive in the hypercompetitive political world. “if you’re a candidate, you can’t play the role of victim, and he shouldn’t either,” bush said. graham said trump’s proposed ban on muslims entering the united states would complicate efforts to gain support from governments in the middle east. at the debate, bush had said trump’s idea was flawed and that a muslim alliance was vital. graham, who has been a sharp trump critic, said bush’s bid to woo latino voters was also critical in widening the reach of the republican party, which has not won the presidency since bush’s brother, george w. bush, was reelected in 2004. bush, said graham, “wants to expand a party that desperately needs to grow.” trump dismissed graham’s move on twitter. “sen. lindsey graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for president and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of bush,” he tweeted.

" u.s. president donald trump on wednesday nominated philip bilden, a former military intelligence officer and private equity executive with broad experience of asia, particularly china, as the civilian head of the u.s. navy. trump has vowed to build up the u.s. navy to 350 ships from the current 290, a move aides say is aimed at countering china’s rapid rise as a military power in the asia pacific. the trump administration on monday raised the prospect of worsening tensions with china when it vowed to prevent beijing from taking over territory in international waters in the south china sea, something chinese state media has warned would require washington to “wage war.” bilden emerged recently as a favorite for the position of navy secretary over the early front runner, former u.s. representative randy forbes, a leading critic of china who chaired the house armed services seapower subcommittee. bilden’s nomination, which must be confirmed by the u.s. senate, follows that of another businessman, vincent viola, an army veteran and founder of a high speed trading firm, to be secretary of the army. neither bilden or viola has experience in government. a white house statement described bilden as “a highly successful business leader, former military intelligence officer, and naval war college cybersecurity leader.” it said he would “bring strategic leadership, investment discipline, and asia pacific regional and cyber expertise to the department of the navy.” “maintaining the strength, readiness, and capabilities of our maritime force is critical to our national security,” bilden said in the white house statement.  “if confirmed, i will ensure that our sailors and marines have the resources they need to defend our interests around the globe and support our allies with commitment and capability.” retired admiral james stavridis, a former nato supreme commander, said bilden was an excellent choice. “(he) is deeply knowledgeable about china, but i would not say he is close to china. many times he has spoken to me about the need to take a firm line in the south china sea,” he told reuters. james carafano, at the heritage foundation think tank said bilden had a deep knowledge of cyber threats, “and understands the threat posed by rising naval powers such as china.” the administration statement said bilden served in the u.s. army reserve as an intelligence officer from 1986 to 1996. he recently retired as a co founding member of harbourvest, a global private equity firm having established its asian presence in hong kong. he is a director of the u.s. naval academy foundation and a trustee of the naval war college foundation, where he chairs the center for cyber conflict studies.

" a pakistani anti corruption court on tuesday issued an arrest warrant for finance minister ishaq dar after the veteran politician failed to turn up for several court hearings. the warrant comes at an awkward time for pakistan, which wants to raise in excess of $1 billion on international debt markets through a sukuk and a eurobond in coming months and has been trying to woo international investors. dar, who has been charged with amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income, has missed three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti graft agency the national accountability bureau (nab). judge mohammad bashir issued the warrant on the grounds of  continued absence  from the court, according to a court statement. dar, who has pleaded not guilty, is receiving medical treatment in london and now faces arrest upon his return to pakistan. the case has been adjourned until nov. 21. the charges against dar followed an investigation into the finances of former prime minister nawaz sharif, who was ousted in july after the supreme court disqualified him for not declaring a small salary from his son s off shore company. the finance minister is one of sharif s closest political allies and dar s son has married sharif s daughter. both men deny any wrongdoing. dar has rejected growing calls to resign amid his legal woes and a worsening economic outlook for pakistan, which is battling to stave off a balance of payments crisis due to dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit. dar was initially lauded for steering pakistan out of a balance of payments crisis in 2013 and returning the nuclear armed country toward a higher growth trajectory. but over the past year he has faced criticism for his refusal to allow the rupee to weaken to ease macroeconomic pressures. he has also been accused of eroding the central bank s independence.

[l5n17j063]. “if anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics, i recommend that he look for a psychiatrist,” he said, laughing. in an interview with abc news after the meeting, sanders called the pope “a beautiful man”, adding “i am not a catholic, but there is a radiance that comes from him.” “i just conveyed to him my admiration for the extraordinary work he is doing raising some of the most important issues facing our planet and the billions of people on the planet and injecting the need for morality in the global economy,” sanders, a brooklyn born son of polish jewish immigrants, told abc. the democratic hopeful from vermont has campaigned on a promise to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower income americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of the pope. the meeting came just days before tuesday’s democratic party primary in new york, where polls say he is trailing hillary clinton. after he won seven of the last eight state contests, a loss in sanders’ home state would give front runner clinton a boost toward the party’s presidential nomination. sanders has said the trip was not a pitch for the catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for the pontiff.

" president donald trump’s signal of a new openness to immigration reform in a speech to the u.s. congress did little to win over democrats who would be essential to revamping the nation’s immigration laws. any goodwill trump may have sparked with his mention of a chance for “real and positive immigration reform” in tuesday’s speech, his first to a joint session of congress, was soon dashed by rhetoric that democrats said tarred and misrepresented most immigrants. “the speech he gave was one of the most anti immigrant speeches that we heard any president ever give,” senate democratic leader charles schumer said on wednesday. what offended democrats, a minority in both chambers, was trump’s reference to past incidents in which one illegal immigrant “viciously gunned down” two california law enforcement officers and another “viciously murdered” a 17 year old boy. trump built a base of support for his 2016 presidential campaign by vowing to fight illegal immigration, including a pledge to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border. on becoming president in january, he immediately issued a temporary visa ban against seven muslim majority countries, later blocked by federal courts. he also suspended a refugee program and initiated tougher deportation procedures. major immigration reform efforts failed in congress under trump’s predecessors, democratic president barack obama and republican george w. bush, because of deep divisions among lawmakers and americans over the issue. the challenges include how to protect illegal immigrants who came to the united states as children, and how to deal long term with the estimated 11 million people living in the country without proper documentation. legislation putting illegal immigrants in line for citizenship threatens to alienate trump’s core conservative voters. trump said in his speech that reform was possible if both democrats and republicans were willing to compromise.     even before tuesday’s address, immigration reform minded republicans and democrats in congress were holding informal lunches and dinners, as well as conversations on the floors of the house of representatives and senate about the possibility of trump eventually moderating his stance. the congressional hispanic caucus will meet on thursday and discuss how, or whether, to react to trump’s signal of openness to reform at a time when a feeling of “fear and hopelessness” pervades latino communities, one house democratic aide said.  republican representative mario diaz balart of florida, a leading voice for overhauling immigration laws, hoped that once the white house dealt with healthcare and tax reforms this year, trump might tackle vexing immigration problems. “remember that old adage that only nixon could go to china,” said diaz balart, a self described optimist and son of cuban immigrants who has labored for years over immigration laws. he was referring to richard nixon, who in 1972 became the first u.s. president to visit the people’s republic of china despite having built his political career as the arch enemy of communist governments. after tuesday’s speech, a major change in tone will likely be needed for democrats to engage with republicans. democratic representative luis gutierrez of illinois challenged attorney general jeff sessions and trump adviser steve bannon, who have both taken a hard line on illegal immigration, to pledge support for immigration reform, “absent that, i don’t believe a thing (they) have to say” on the administration’s interest in reforming immigration law, gutierrez told reporters. gutierrez is of puerto rican descent and has worked in the past with republicans on immigration legislation. some prominent republicans said progress on the first major immigration reform since 1986 was still possible. senator john mccain of arizona, who helped win senate passage in 2013 of a sweeping bipartisan immigration law rewrite that subsequently died in the house, said of trump’s upbeat remarks: “i would hope that would open the door for negotiations and support” for legislation. senator jeff flake, an arizona republican who joined with mccain and others in 2013, said if there was an opportunity to go forward, trump would likely want to pair bills that would be supported by opposing sides in the immigration debate. for example, flake speculated, the president might support putting into law temporary protections shielding “dreamers” from deportation   people who entered the united states as children. in return, conservatives could win new legislation on border security or “expedited deportations,” he said, a trade off democrats might not want to make.

" republican donald trump campaigned on a promise to shake up washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the united states handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies. yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from congress after he takes office on jan. 20. while he will may enjoy a post election honeymoon with congressional republicans, a long lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with republican orthodoxy. following is an overview of trump’s top policy plans: in his campaign, trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt u.s. workers and the country’s competitiveness. he has promised to “get tough” on china and withdraw from the 12 nation trans pacific partnership, or tpp, which is still not finalized. as president, trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as china.  president barack obama’s administration has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for tpp, saying its fate was up to trump and republican lawmakers. trump has also said he would renegotiate or scrap the north american free trade agreement, the 1994 free trade deal with mexico and canada. both canada and mexico have indicated they are willing to discuss the agreement with trump. canada has indicated it would consider a free trade agreement that excludes mexico. economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to t shirts. u.s. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.      trump has promised to build a wall along the mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been “compromised by terrorism.”  since his election, he has said parts could be a fence instead of a wall, and he would act to deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records. it was unclear where his figure comes from. think tank migration policy institute estimated in a 2015 report there were 820,000 unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.    those policies would not come cheap. trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. other estimates have run much higher. politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. while many congressional republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost. trump has said he would force mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want.  trump also promised to withhold federal funds from “sanctuary cities” such as new york and los angeles that shield people who are in the country illegally.     more broadly, trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like republican senator jeff sessions of alabama who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. that would be a blow to business groups and hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws. trump has promised to repeal president barack obama’s signature affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. he would need congress to act, and republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100 member senate. republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of americans who previously had no healthcare. after the election trump said he would consider retaining parts of obamacare, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with existing conditions. trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of u.s. government spending. that combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan center for a responsible budget. he has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year. on taxes, he would get plenty of help from republicans in congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. but they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks. trump’s promise to protect entitlement programs such as social security and medicare will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. but those programs are popular with the american public. trump has promised a “dismantling” of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. both trump and the republican party have called for reinstating glass steagall, the 1930s era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit taking institutions. republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most despised pieces of the dodd frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to glass steagall. trump appears to be leaning toward weakening the law in a manner similar to what was proposed in a bill known as the choice act this summer by jeb hensarling, the republican chairman of the u.s. house financial services committee.      trump has offered few details about his plans to fight islamic state but has said he would “knock the hell out of” the militant group. he says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. trump said that if he won, he would give u.s. generals 30 days after taking office on jan. 20 to propose their own plans. trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in syria, and instead has said he would create “safe zones” there, which he says would be funded by gulf states. obama has said a safe zone in syria would require a large u.s. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with americans weary of lengthy wars in iraq and afghanistan. trump has said he would have a “very, very good” relationship with russia.  trump has said could work with russia to combat islamic state. he also said he would look into recognizing crimea, seized from ukraine in 2014, as russian territory and lifting sanctions on russia imposed by western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. trump has criticized the north atlantic treaty organization, saying some u.s. allies have not met their defense commitments. in july, he said if russia attacked a nato member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. nato leaders say the sanctions against russia are key to persuading it to change that country’s behavior in ukraine, where it has backed ethnic russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. with one vacancy on the supreme court and several more possible in the coming four years, trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the courts for decades to come. his list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and republicans in the u.s. senate, who will be eager to help him in that area. trump has called global warming a hoax and said he wants to cancel the 2015 paris agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on nov. 4. instead, he says he will push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil.  trump’s advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on his transition team.

" australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull, a strong supporter of gay marriage, defended the right of a church to refuse to marry a young couple who had posted support for same sex unions on social media.  the minister of a presbyterian church in the southern state of victoria told a young couple in their 20s that they would not be allowed to hold their ceremony at the church after the bride posted a message on facebook supporting same sex marriage.  australia is in the midst of a non compulsory, non binding poll to inform parliament on whether it should become the 25th country to legalise same sex marriage. the issue has threatened to fracture the ruling liberal national coalition government.   churches are free to marry whoever they like,  turnbull said on friday in canberra according to a press conference transcript.  as strongly as i believe in the right of same sex couples to marry ... religious freedom is fundamental and it will be protected in any bill that emerges from this parliament.   religious freedom in australia is guaranteed under the constitution. the issue has dogged prime minister turnbull for two years as progressive and conservative members of his ruling coalition have pulled in opposite directions threatening his narrow parliamentary majority.   australians have started receiving postal ballots for the poll, which runs until the end of october, and the issue is dividing the country s population of 24 million people along religious and generational lines. despite securing 70 percent public support in an ipsos/fairfax poll, the issue of same sex marriage had faced a political deadlock, only broken last week when the high court gave the all clear for the vote.  fissures have opened within religions as some churches urge their followers to vote against same sex marriage, while other churches have taken a neutral stance.  the catholic archbishop of sydney, australia s largest city, wrote to sydney catholic school principals on friday afternoon, quoting pope francis and urging them to oppose the vote. the bishop of parramatta, vincent long van nguyen, however, told his parishioners in a pastoral letter that the vote was a matter of individual conscience.  the anglican church, which officially opposes gay marriage, has been divided on the issue for years.

"  good preparations  should be made by china and the united states to ensure that u.s. president donald trump s visit to china later this year is a success, chinese foreign minister wang yi told u.s. vice president mike pence. trump will likely visit china in november as part of a trip that will take him to an asean summit in the philippines and an apec summit in vietnam. the two sides should make good preparations for the visit to ensure its success so that  concrete achievements can be obtained and conditions can be created for good prospects, giving fresh impetus to bilateral ties,  wang said, according to the official xinhua news agency on thursday. close communications between xi and trump have meant a  smooth transition  and a  good start  in china s relationship with the united states under the new administration, he said. a  stable and healthy  relationship between the two countries is good for both countries and the international community, wang told pence on the sidelines of the annual general debate of the united nations general assembly on wednesday, xinhua reported. china s relationship with the united states has been strained by the trump administration s criticism of china s trade practices and by demands that beijing do more to pressure north korea to halt its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. chinese president xi jinping and trump met for the first time in person at trump s mar a lago estate in florida in april. trump has since played up his personal relationship with xi, even when criticizing china over north korea and trade. the two sides launched a 100 day economic plan at that meeting, including some industry specific announcements such as the resumption of american beef sales in china. there has since been limited progress on trade relations, especially after trump began to launch trade investigations into chinese practices via the world trade organization. trump s administration has also repeatedly called on china to do more to rein in north korea and has threatened new sanctions on chinese banks and other firms doing business with pyongyang. china says it is already doing all it can to pressure north korea and that those countries directly involved in the stand off on the peninsula should take responsibility for resolving tensions.

" north korea on tuesday rejected a u.n. security council resolution imposing tougher sanctions and said the united states would soon face the  greatest pain  it had ever experienced. the security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea on monday over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, imposing a ban on its textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.  my delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal and unlawful u.n. security council resolution,  pyongyang s ambassador, han tae song, told the u.n. sponsored conference on disarmament in geneva. han accused the u.s. administration of being  fired up for political, economic, and military confrontation,  and of being   obsessed with the wild game of reversing the dprk s development of nuclear force which has already reached the completion phase . north korea was condemned globally for its latest nuclear test on sept. 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb. the democratic people s republic of korea (dprk) is  ready to use a form of ultimate means , han said without elaborating.  the forthcoming measures by dprk will make the u.s. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history,  he said. u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood took the floor to say that the security council resolution  frankly sent a very clear and unambiguous message to the regime that the international community is tired, is no longer willing to put up provocative behavior from this regime .  my hope is the regime will hear the message loud and clear and it will choose a different path,  wood said.  we call on all countries to vigorously implement these new sanctions and all other existing sanctions,  he added.

" afghan and u.s. military authorities are investigating reports that as many as 13 civilians were killed in an operation in the northern region of kunduz, officials said on monday, but details remain sketchy three days after the incident. there were conflicting reports of the casualty numbers in friday s incident in the district of chahardara outside kunduz. a local council member said 13 people were killed, but a spokesman for the provincial governor said it was just one. however, the incident underlines the risk of increased civilian casualties from the recent u.s. decision to step up air strikes and special forces operations in afghanistan to break a stalemate with taliban militants.  there is a need for a proper investigation to prove these allegations and we will launch it soon,  ghulam qader akbari, the governor of chahardara, said on monday. on saturday, the nato led resolute support mission in kabul confirmed the incident had occurred in kunduz and said an investigation had begun, but gave no details.  we are aware of allegations regarding the potential for civilian casualties as the result of a combined operation in northern afghanistan,  resolute support spokesman capt tom gresback said in a statement.  resolute support takes all allegations of civilian casualties and the responsibility of human life seriously, and is assessing the facts surrounding this incident.  khosh bawar nasratyar, a member of the local provincial council, said 13 people had been killed by u.s. airstrikes in the district. but nematullah temor, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said only one civilian had been killed and six wounded when coalition forces hit a car taking people to the villages of ghar o qeshlaq and qatl e am to evacuate taliban casualties. he said other reports of civilian casualties were  untrue and baseless . afghan special forces said 48 insurgents had been killed in chahardara but denied any civilian casualties, saying the area had been evacuated before the operation. but graphic pictures purporting to show the aftermath of the incident, and unconfirmed reports that as many as 60 people had been killed, were widely shared on social media, highlighting the risk that public opinion could turn decisively against the government over the issue. the most recent united nations civilian casualty figures, released last month, show air strikes drove a rise of 52 percent in the first nine months of 2017, to 205 killed and 261 injured, versus the corresponding period last year. former president hamid karzai, who clashed bitterly with the united states over civilian casualties when he was in power, condemned the incident, but there was no comment from the government of president ashraf ghani.

" u.s. health and human services secretary tom price promised on thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights, as expensive air travel by trump administration officials drew sharp scrutiny from congress. “today, i will write a personal check to the u.s. treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes,” said price, a former member of congress, in a statement. “the taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.” price was one of a handful of senior officials in president donald trump’s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money.  price told fox news on thursday that trump had spoken to him about the matter and was not happy. asked if he retained trump’s confidence, price said he worked at the president’s pleasure. washington media outlet politico reported that price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since may at a cost to u.s. taxpayers of more than $400,000. politico in a report on thursday night said the white house had approved the use of military aircraft for other trips by price to africa, europe and asia in the spring and summer that cost taxpayers more than $500,000. “secretary price will write a personal check to the u.s. treasury for $51,887.31,” a spokeswoman for the department of health and human services said on thursday. price is paying his individual share of the charter flight cost, an hhs official said. price said earlier on thursday he believed he retained trump’s confidence. senior u.s. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep the costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. price, environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt and treasury secretary steve mnuchin were all in the spotlight for their travel habits. politico reported late on thursday that interior secretary ryan zinke took a charter flight from las vegas to glacier park international airport in montana in june that cost $12,375. the route is served by commercial flights. zinke also took charter flights between st. croix and st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands in march and used a military aircraft to travel to norway in may, according to politico. “as with previous interior secretaries, the secretary traveled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,” interior department spokeswoman heather swift said in a statement. “all travel is pre approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.”  republican senator chuck grassley urged trump in a statement “to emphasize to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions.” in his statement, price said his travel had been approved by legal and departmental officials. but he expressed regret over the concerns raised and pledged to take no more private charter flights while health secretary. “i was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer,” said price, an orthopedic surgeon. he was confirmed in february as health secretary despite questions about how he had been buying shares in publicly traded healthcare companies while working on legislation affecting them. as a conservative republican u.s. representative in 2009, price chastised “the fiscal irresponsibility” of private plane use by government officials in an appearance on cnbc television that he also posted on twitter. price’s travels and those of the entire trump cabinet are being probed by a u.s. house of representatives committee.  senate democrats wrote to price on thursday demanding information about his flights.         the inspectors general at hhs, epa and treasury are investigating to see if government travel rules were followed. the epa’s inspector general said last month it was investigating pruitt’s frequent travels to his home state of oklahoma. the washington post reported on thursday that pruitt had taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid february, costing taxpayers more than $58,000. epa spokeswoman liz bowman said pruitt did use one charter flight but that other commissioned flights were done on government planes. “the administrator flies commercial, unless there is a necessity to do otherwise, and with approvals from epa’s ethics office,” said epa spokesman jahan wilcox. at the treasury department, the inspector general is reviewing mnuchin’s use of a government plane to fly to kentucky in august for a visit to louisville and fort knox. mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip. on the “cbs this morning” program on thursday, mnuchin said he would use military planes in the future only when there are national security issues or “there’s no other means” of travel.

" the populist danish people s party (df), upon whose support the minority government depends to pass laws, gave its backing on friday to a fiscal budget for 2018 but one of the coalition parties said it still wanted an agreement on tax cuts. the liberal alliance (la), a junior partner in the three way coalition led by prime minister lokke rasmussen s liberals and also including the conservative party said it would not support the budget in parliament unless a deal to cut taxes was agreed. but df, which is not a member of the coalition, said it could not guarantee that a deal involving  historically big tax cuts  could be reached. if la does not vote to give the budget final approval, rasmussen could be forced either to hand power to the social democrat led opposition or to call a snap election.  we don t know how this will all end,  df s negotiator ren  christensen told reporters.  otherwise we would have had three deals now,  he said, referring to another proposal by df that would tighten rules on granting residency to refugees. economy minister simon emil ammitzboll bille, a la lawmaker, said the budget negotiations had been  chaotic  and there had been a  crisis of confidence  between the parties, but that the confidence had now been re established. tax cuts have been on the right leaning government s wish list for a long time, but pro welfare df has been less eager to back that part of the government s policies. the parties will meet again after the weekend to discuss the proposed tax cuts and df s proposal to make it easier for authorities to revoke residence permits for refugees from war once there is peace in their home countries. the budget deal includes among other things increased spending on health and elderly care and on infrastructure.

" democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was endorsed  by the congressional black caucus on thursday, a much needed boost to her campaign as it competes for the important black voting bloc in south carolina’s primary this month. clinton and her husband, former president bill clinton, have built strong ties to the african american community over the past decades. several lawmakers cited clinton’s long history of not only working on issues important to black americans, but on getting democrats elected and advancing the party’s agenda.  “mrs clinton has demonstrated her leadership skills. she has labored in various capacities all of her adult life and now she is ready to serve our country by occupying the highest office in our country,” said u.s. representative g.k. butterfield. the group’s backing will be important as clinton seeks to recover from tuesday’s stinging loss to u.s. senator bernie sanders in the new hampshire primary. black voters make up a large bloc in the democratic primary in south carolina and will be increasingly significant to the democrats as the presidential contest moves from iowa and new hampshire to more demographically diverse states. the congressional black caucus political action committee planned to send a dozen members to south carolina to campaign for clinton over the weekend in advance of the state’s feb. 27 democratic primary. sanders, fresh off his victory in new hampshire, had breakfast on wednesday with one of america’s most prominent civil rights activists, rev. al sharpton, recognizing the need to broaden his base to mount a long term challenge to clinton. u.s. representative james clyburn, an influential african american from south carolina, declined to make a personal endorsement before the caucus announcement in washington.  appearing on cnn thursday morning, clyburn praised sanders’ voting record and had no criticism of the u.s. senator from vermont.  but his comments suggested he was leaning toward clinton, whom he credited with significant contributions to issues important to black americans, particularly universal access to health care and children’s issues. butterfield was more pointed in alluding to sanders, who promises universal health care and free college tuition. “we need a president who doesn’t simply campaign and just promise wonderful things but things that are politically impossible to achieve,” he said at the caucus announcement.

" cuba s top diplomat warned the united states on tuesday against taking hasty decisions over alleged incidents that have harmed u.s. embassy staff in havana and urged its authorities to cooperate on the investigation into the mysterious affair. cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez had called for tuesday s meeting with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson in washington to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former cold war foes. the highest level meeting to take place between the two countries since u.s. president donald trump took office came 10 days after tillerson said the united states was considering closing its recently re opened embassy in havana.  the foreign minister reaffirmed that the investigation to resolve this matter is still in progress,  the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement, noting that  effective cooperation  of u.s. authorities was essential.   it would be regrettable that a matter of this nature is politicized and that hasty decisions not supported by conclusive evidence and investigation results are taken.  the meeting  took place in a respectful ambiance , the  cuban foreign ministry said. the u.s. state department said the conversation was  firm and frank  and tillerson  conveyed the gravity of the situation and underscored the cuban authorities  obligations to protect embassy staff.  washington earlier this year expelled two cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents, which it says caused symptoms from hearing loss to nausea in u.s. embassy staff and their families in havana, although it has so far not laid blame on cuba. cuba reiterated on tuesday that it  has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any kind against diplomats,  and said it had implemented additional measures to protect u.s. personnel since they reported the incidents. the case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since trump took office to the boil. trump, who in june vowed to partially roll back the detente with cuba agreed by his democratic predecessor, president barack obama, called the communist run nation  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the united nations general assembly last week.  he said he would not lift the u.s. trade embargo on the caribbean island until it made  fundamental reforms.  cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.   cuba s investigation had uncovered  no evidence so far of the cause or the origin of the health disorders reported by the u.s. diplomats,  the country s foreign ministry said. experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of cuban american exiles or third party state actors such as russia, iran or north korea, but most flounder. audiologists, for example, have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.

" china and pakistan will look at extending their $57 billion china pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan, chinese foreign minister wang yi said on tuesday, part of china s ambitious belt and road plan linking china with asia, europe and beyond. china has tried to position itself as a helpful party to promote talks between pakistan and afghanistan, both uneasy neighbors ever since pakistan s independence in 1947. their ties have been poisoned in recent years by afghan accusations that pakistan is supporting taliban insurgents fighting the u.s. backed kabul in order to limit the influence of its old rival, india, in afghanistan. pakistan denies that and says it wants to see a peaceful, stable afghanistan. speaking after the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of china, pakistan and afghanistan, wang said china hoped the economic corridor could benefit the whole region and act as an impetus for development. afghanistan has urgent need to develop and improve people s lives and hopes it can join inter connectivity initiatives, wang told reporters, as he announced that pakistan and afghanistan had agreed to mend their strained relations.  so china and pakistan are willing to look at with afghanistan, on the basis of win win, mutually beneficial principles, using an appropriate means to extend the china pakistan economic corridor to afghanistan,  he added. how that could happen needs the three countries to reach a gradual consensus, tackling easier, smaller projects first, wang said, without giving details. pakistani foreign minister khawaja asif said his country and china were  iron brothers , but did not directly mention the prospect of afghanistan joining the corridor.  the successful implementation of cpec (china pakistan economic corridor) projects will serve as a model for enhancing connectivity and cooperation through similar projects with neighboring countries, including afghanistan, iran and with central and west asia,  he said. india has looked askance at the project as parts of it run through pakistan administered kashmir that india considers its own territory, though wang said the plan had nothing to do with territorial disputes. china has sought to bring kabul and islamabad together partly due to chinese fears about the spread of islamist militancy from pakistan and afghanistan to the unrest prone far western chinese region of xinjiang. as such, china has pushed for pakistan and afghanistan to improve their own ties so they can better tackle the violence in their respective countries, and has also tried to broker peace talks with afghan taliban militants, to limited effect. a tentative talks process collapsed in 2015. wang said china fully supported peace talks between the afghan government and taliban and would continue to provide  necessary facilitation . the belt and road infrastructure drive aims to build a modern day  silk road  connecting china to economies in southeast and central asia by land and the middle east and europe by sea.

" germany s sept. 24 national election has shown the country is divided by new, less visible  walls , president frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday, the anniversary of german reunification. speaking 27 years after east and west germany were reunited following the 1989 fall of the berlin wall, steinmeier said the election, which saw the far right enter parliament, had exposed  large and small cracks  in society and he called on democratic lawmakers to work together to fight any return to nationalism.  on september 24th, it became clear that other walls have arisen, less visible, without barbed wire and death strips, but walls that stand in the way of our common sense of  us ,  steinmeier said in a speech in the western city of mainz. chancellor angela merkel won a fourth term in office in the election, but the vote brought a far right party into parliament for the first time in more than half a century. a fractured vote means she will have to govern with a far less stable coalition. merkel, who grew up in communist east germany, said the reunification anniversary was  a day of joy . reunified germany carried a responsibility to uphold freedom at home and abroad, she said.  we know we cannot disconnect from what s going on in the world. rather, we must take care that globalization is constructed humanely,  she added at celebrations in mainz. but steinmeier, a center left social democrat who was foreign minister before taking up the largely ceremonial presidency role in march, said that germany now has  walls between our living environments . he said these had sprung up  between city and country, online and offline, poor and rich, old and young   walls, from behind which people hardly understand anything of each other.  a poll on monday showed nearly two thirds of germans still see divisions between those in the former communist east and the west, a sort of  berlin wall in the head . in germany s new parliament, comprising six party groups compared to four previously,  political culture will change , steinmeier said. the far right alternative for germany (afd) has vowed to  hunt  the new government, whatever its make up. the president urged lawmakers to show that  democrats have better solutions than those who abuse democracy , and to never allow a return to nationalism. he said germany needed a sense of  homeland  with a common, democratic, way forward. a leading member of the afd, alexander gauland, provoked outrage last month for saying that germans should no longer be reproached with their nazi past and should take pride in what their soldiers achieved during world war one and two.  steinmeier said germany needed an honest discussion about immigration   the issue that fueled the rise of the afd after merkel s 2015 decision to leave german borders open to around 1 million refugees, mostly fleeing war in the middle east. he called for discussion about how much migration germany wants, and needs, adding that this could mean new guidelines.  in my view, this means not simply wishing away migration but ... defining legal admission to germany, which regulates and controls migration by our stipulations,  he said.

" former manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara, who earned a reputation for fighting crime on wall street and public corruption before president donald trump fired him in march, has signed a book deal with alfred a. knopf.  the book, as yet untitled, is about “the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,” knopf said in a statement on thursday. publication is expected in january 2019. bharara said his book would be about the law, “integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.” “it addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,” bharara said in a statement. in 2009, president barack obama appointed bharara to serve as u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, which includes manhattan.  during seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. “preet bharara’s life experience, coupled with his standing as a u.s. attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,” said sonny mehta, editor in chief for knopf, which is a division of penguin random house. bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at new york university’s law school, was unexpectedly fired by trump on march 11 after refusing to step down. he had been among 46 u.s. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. in november, bharara met with trump at trump tower in new york city, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a “good meeting” and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.” he was fired a few months later. this month, bharara told abc news in an interview that he received “unusual” phone calls from trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. he said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  bharara said he believed trump’s calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. knopf spokesman paul bogaards said on thursday that bharara “addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.” whether the book itself goes into the details of bharara’s firing “remains an open question,” bogaards said.

" six in 10 american voters support the new ban on people from six predominantly muslim countries from entering the united states unless they can show they have a close relative here, according to opinion poll results released on wednesday. the politico morning consult poll found 37 percent of voters said they “strongly supported” the new u.s. state department guidelines that would deny visas to citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen who do not have close relatives in the united states. another 23 percent of voters said they “somewhat support” the guidelines. the poll was conducted online on thursday and friday following a u.s. supreme court ruling that partly upheld the ban, with 1,989 registered voters taking part. the poll results' margin of error was 2 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. (link to the poll: politi.co/2ujlfoo) the survey asked respondents whether they support or oppose the state department’s new guidelines, “which say visa applicants from six predominately muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a u.s. resident in order to enter the country.” it did not mention u.s. president donald trump, nor the president’s executive orders on immigration.  the supreme court ruled on june 26 that the temporary travel ban could proceed so long as visa applicants with a “bona fide relationship” with a person or entity in the united states were exempted.  a year before his election, trump promised voters he would seek a temporary “total and complete shutdown” of muslims entering the united states. trump said it was necessary to prevent attacks by islamist militants, while critics said it was a needlessly discriminatory policy that could inflame prejudice against muslims in the united states and abroad. the partial ban, which took effect on thursday, was most strongly supported by trump’s fellow republicans, 83 percent of whom approved. even among democratic voters, only 46 percent said they were opposed.  forty one percent of democrats said they support it, and the remaining 13 percent said they “don’t know.”   the supreme court allowed the ban, which bars people from the designated six countries for 90 days and refugees from any country for 120 days, to take effect until it can take up the case during its next term starting in october.

" nearly 400 people have died in fighting that has rocked myanmar s northwest for a week, new official data show, making it probably the deadliest bout of violence to engulf the country s rohingya muslim minority in decades. about 38,000 rohingya have crossed into bangladesh from myanmar, u.n. sources said on friday, a week after rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army base in rakhine state, prompting clashes and a military counteroffensive. the army says it is conducting clearance operations against  extremist terrorists  and security forces have been told to protect civilians. but rohingya fleeing to bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings aims to force them out. u.n. secretary general antonio guterres is  deeply concerned  by reports of the use of excessive force during the army s operations in rakhine state, spokeswoman eri kaneko said in a statement on friday.   (he) urges restraint and calm to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe,  kaneko said.  the secretary general underlines the responsibility of the government of myanmar to provide security and assistance to all those in need and to enable the united nations and its partners to extend the humanitarian support they are ready to provide,  she said. the treatment of myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingya is the biggest challenge facing national leader aung san suu kyi, accused by some western critics of not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution. the clashes and ensuing army crackdown have killed about 370 rohingya insurgents, 13 security forces, two government officials and 14 civilians, the myanmar military said on thursday. by comparison, communal violence in 2012 in sittwe, the capital of rakhine, led to the killing of nearly 200 people and the displacement of about 140,000, most of them rohingya. the fighting is a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since october, when similar but much smaller rohingya attacks on security posts prompted a brutal military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses. myanmar evacuated more than 11,700  ethnic residents  from the area affected by fighting, the army said, referring to the non muslim population of northern rakhine. more than 150 rohingya insurgents staged fresh attacks on security forces on thursday near villages occupied by hindus, the state run global new light of myanmar said, adding that about 700 members of such families had been evacuated.  four of the terrorists were arrested, including one 13 year old boy,  it said, adding that security forces had arrested two more men near a maungdaw police outpost on suspicion of involvement in the attacks. about 20,000 more rohingya trying to flee are stuck in no man s land at the border, the u.n. sources said, as aid workers in bangladesh struggle to alleviate the sufferings of a sudden influx of thousands of hungry and traumatized people. while some rohingya try to cross by land, others attempt a perilous boat journey across the naf river separating the two countries. bangladesh border guards found the bodies of 15 rohingya muslims, 11 children among them, floating in the river on friday, area commander lieutenant colonel ariful islam told reuters. that takes to about 40 the total of rohingya known to have died by drowning. late on friday, bangladesh foreign ministry said it had lodged a  strong protest  against violation of air space by myanmar helicopters on three days this week, including friday, near the area where the rohingya are fleeing violence.  these instances of incursion into bangladesh air space by myanmar helicopters run contrary to the good neighborly relations and could lead to unwarranted situation,  said the foreign ministry statement. suu kyi spokesman zaw htay said h he was not aware of the complaint but that there were channels in place for dialogue between the two sides. if myanmar receives the complaint from bangladesh, it will respond, he said.

" greece does not expect it will need a precautionary credit line when it exits its bailout next year, a view that is in line with its official creditors, the finance minister said on friday after a meeting of euro zone ministers in tallinn. greece s 86 billion euro bailout program, its third since 2010 when its debt crisis exploded, ends in august next year and by then athens aims to have fully returned to market financing.  it is pretty clear that the greek government, the european institutions and the imf are not thinking of a precautionary credit line, there is no reason for it,  euclid tsakalotos told reporters. he said that based on a eurogroup decision in june, greece  should have a buffer of funds to ensure a clean exit from the bailout program and to pay down state arrears. the money will likely come from bailout funds that will be left unused.  what emerges from the eurogroup s statement in june is that we may get part of these funds to form a buffer and pay down state arrears. this is a discussion that will take place between february and may, not now,  he said. tsakalotos echoed european central bank executive board member benoit coeure, who said he saw no need to conduct an asset quality review (aqr) at greek banks as a broader european union wide stress test is already being planned for 2018.  the greek case is simple, greek banks are part of the european system. we have the european authorities, the ecb and the ssm (single supervisory mechanism), neither of which is asking for an asset quality review,  tsakalotos said. the minister said that greek banks will take part in the pan european stress test next year and projected that economic recovery in the next two years will help lenders reduce their high level of non performing loans.

" chuck grassley and merrick garland go way back, but when the republican senate judiciary committee chairman and president barack obama’s u.s. supreme court nominee meet for a private breakfast on tuesday, they will not exactly be sharing fond memories. two decades ago, grassley, an iowa republican, spearheaded a fight against garland’s nomination to the influential u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. just like now, a democratic president, in that case bill clinton, submitted garland’s nomination to a republican controlled senate. garland, then a top justice department lawyer, was denied a senate confirmation vote in 1995 and 1996 despite earning bipartisan praise. finally, in 1997, after clinton renominated garland upon winning re election in 1996, was he confirmed to a seat on the court that was a launching pad to the supreme court for chief justice john roberts, justices ruth bader ginsburg and clarence thomas, as well as the late antonin scalia. fast forward to 2016: another democratic president has chosen garland to replace scalia only to have grassley and a republican senate maneuver to block the nomination without so much as a judiciary committee hearing. “nothin’ against him,” the 82 year old grassley, who describes himself as “just a farmer from butler county,” told reuters. even so, garland, 63, will sit down with grassley on tuesday and be told that once again, his nomination will be put on ice. in 1995 and 1996, garland was entangled in “what ended up being a 12  or 15 year crusade,” grassley said, to reduce the number of judges on the federal appeals court that clinton chose him to join. two decades later, grassley again offered no criticism of garland’s qualifications. grassley, like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, has decided to ignore garland’s nomination in the hope that a republican will be elected president on nov. 8 and, after taking office in january, would choose a conservative rather than the centrist garland. “it’s not about him because we’re living by the principle ‘let the people have a voice,’” grassley said, referring to the november presidential and congressional elections. grassley, no stranger to controversy during 35 years in the senate, has become the target of democrats’ scorn in this supreme court drama. senate democratic leader harry reid said grassley could go down as both inept and the “most obstructionist” judiciary committee chairman in history. other voices have weighed in against grassley and his fellow republicans, with the des moines register newspaper in his home state calling the garland blockade “un american.” grassley, facing re election in november, insists he will not buckle, and called the register’s editorial “hyperbolic rhetoric.” in a senate speech last week, he recounted showdowns dating back to the 1980s when he took on a popular president from his own party, ronald reagan, over budget matters. “i am no stranger to political pressure and to strong arm tactics,” grassley said. grassley then turned his attention to roberts, criticizing a speech the chief justice made shortly before scalia’s death about the politicization of the confirmation process and warning roberts, appointed by republican george w. bush, to keep his mouth shut in the garland fight. “now that’s a political temptation that the chief justice should resist,” grassley said.

" britain’s looming exit from the european union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive u.s. eu free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti trade sentiment on both sides of the atlantic.  the historic divorce launched by thursday’s vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip) talks as the remaining 27 eu states sort out their own new relationship with britain, trade experts said on friday.  with french and german officials increasingly voicing skepticism about ttip’s chances for success, the united kingdom’s departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before president barack obama leaves office in january. “this is yet another reason why ttip will likely be postponed,” said heather conley, european program director at the center for strategic and international studies, a think tank in washington. “but to be honest, ttip isn’t going anywhere, i believe, before 2018 at the earliest,” she said. u.s. trade representative michael froman said in a statement on friday that he was evaluating the uk decision’s impact on ttip, but would continue to engage with both european and uk counterparts.     “the importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the european union and the united kingdom,” froman said. “the economic and strategic rationale for t tip remains strong.” ttip negotiators are still expected to meet in brussels in mid july as scheduled, but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for u.s. and eu political leaders to resolve. and it is unclear when britain will launch formal separation proceedings, which will take at least two years. but analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new u.s. president due to take office in january and french and german leadership elections nearing in 2017. the brexit also will preoccupy eu officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with london over the future terms of uk eu trade, and sort out their post brexit priorities, said hosuk lee makiyama, director of the european centre for international political economy, a brussels based think tank.     britain’s departure could leave u.s. negotiators facing a european side that is more dug in on some issues, said chad bown, a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics, a think tank in washington. “as the uk is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the eu, the u.s. is losing one of the more like minded countries from the group in brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table,” said bown, a former world bank economist. however, lee makiyama, who also sees little chance of a deal before 2018, said britain’s departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the uk has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal. “the only real proponent of banking regulation in ttip is the uk. germany and france are probably willing to let it go,” he said. “it still leaves about 20 outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty.” the ttip negotiations, which started three years ago, have unable to settle major differences over agriculture, where the eu side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit american beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods, or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules, such as for asiago and feta cheeses. european negotiators have complained that the united states has offered too little to open up its vast federal, state and local government procurement markets to european vendors with “buy american” preferences in place. europe also wants access to key u.s. sectors such as maritime transport and aviation, while american negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some 200 european sectors ranging from healthcare to education. the two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes. the u.s. side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach, while the europeans want a court like system that allows for appeals. more progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors, clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections.

" kenyan opposition leader raila odinga called for calm on sunday as he visited a slum in the capital that was hit by violence when a political stand off over a repeat presidential election fed into rising ethnic tensions. clashes in kawangware and in a village in western kenya following thursday s vote were the first signs that face offs between odinga supporters and the police might eventually morph into neighbors turning against each other.  a country cannot be ruled by the gun. standing here in this church we want to condemn the militarization of politics in this country,  odinga told residents in the nairobi slum. the veteran opposition leader had boycotted the re run of an august presidential election that was nullified by kenya s supreme court on procedural grounds, leaving president uhuru kenyatta with an almost free run against six minor candidates. on friday, a day after the repeat vote was held in most of the country, ethnic violence in kawangware saw dozens of homes and shops torched and one man killed. most of buildings torched belonged to residents from the kenyatta s kikuyu tribe.  one man from odinga s luo group was killed overnight near  koguta village in the west of the country, after residents from two ethnic groups backing different candidates armed themselves.  if such isolated incidents become a trend, it could ignite large swathes of kenya, as happened after a 2007 presidential election when weeks of violence left 1,200 dead. that sent ripples throughout east africa, which relies on kenya as a trade and diplomatic hub.  in his speech, odinga condemned violence generally and did not single out any particular attack.   we have come here to give consolation to those who were beaten and killed. we as nasa condemn what happened,  he told worshippers at a church in kawangware, referring to his national super alliance, an opposition coalition.  odinga boycotted thursday s vote because he said the contest would not be fair. instead, he wanted the oct. 26 contest dismissed and fresh elections held within 90 days.  his withdrawal means kenyans are watching the turnout, rather than the result, for an indication of kenyatta s popularity for a second, five year term.  results published on sunday by the election commission showed that kenyatta had won slightly more than 98 percent of the vote with results in from 244 out of 291 constituencies.  turnout for the constituencies counted so far was 43 percent. that figure is likely to decrease when it includes returns of 0 from least 23 constituencies where authorities were unable to open even a single polling station because of protests by odinga s supporters.  the election board planned to try to hold elections there on saturday, but postponed the plan amid fears of further violence.

" the head of the u.n. refugee agency said on saturday he was shocked by the  terrible violence  inflicted on rohingya refugees fleeing myanmar, and said their suffering would last far longer than the time it took to satisfy their basic needs.   more than 420,000 rohingya muslims have fled to bangladesh since aug. 25, when attacks by rohingya militants in rakhine state triggered a myanmar crackdown that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing. during a visit to the sprawling kutapalong refugee camp in southeastern bangladesh, close to the myanmar border, the united nations high commissioner for refugees, filippo grandi, said rohingyas had told him their stories.  i was really struck by the fear that these people carry with themselves, what they have gone through and seen back in myanmar,  he told reuters in the camp, where refugees live under thousands of tarpaulins covering the hills and rice paddies.   parents killed, families divided, wounds inflicted, rapes perpetrated on women. there s a lot of terrible violence that has occurred and it will take a long time for people to heal their wounds, longer than satisfying their basic needs,  grandi said. the speed and scale of the exodus from myanmar has left hundreds of thousands living in dire conditions in a poor part of a poor country, and u.n and aid agencies are scrambling to give people shelter, get them fed and prevent an outbreak of disease.   a senior u.n. official said on friday that an estimated $200 million would be needed to help the refugees in bangladesh for six months. aid workers fear a humanitarian crisis is also unfolding in rakhine state, though myanmar has restricted access. rohingyas, who trace their roots back generations in myanmar, are a stateless minority who have mostly been stripped of their citizenship in the predominantly buddhist country. tensions between the communities have simmered for decades and exploded into violence several times in recent years. myanmar leader aung san suu kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism over their plight, for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. myanmar dismisses accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it has to tackle the insurgents, whom it accuses of starting fires and attacking civilians as well as the security forces.   grandi, who in july called for myanmar to grant rohingyas citizenship, also asked a rohingya refugee in bangladesh what it would take for him to return.  the refugee said myanmar needed to restore citizenship and fundamental rights, and that violence was  continuing . rights group amnesty international said on friday new satellite images and videos showed plumes of smoke were still rising from villages in rakhine state.

(the) apology will give a great deal of comfort to many who were unjustly prosecuted and will help draw a line, once and for all, under a dark period in scotland s history,  gay rights group stonewall said in a statement.  the legislation  acknowledges the wrongfulness and discriminatory effect of past convictions for certain historical sexual offences  by pardoning people convicted of those offences and providing a legal process for convictions to be disregarded. in january, the uk government passed a similar law relating to england and wales.

" ukraine s state security service sbu have detained a government official on suspicion of working in the interests of russia, prime minister volodymyr groysman said on thursday.  together with the security service of ukraine, an official in the government s secretariat was found to be working for a long time in the interests of the enemy state. he was detained,  groysman said on facebook. neither he nor the sbu named the position or name of the detained official, but lawmakers and local media said the suspect was called stanislav yezhov, a deputy head of the government s protocol service who had also worked as an interpreter for groysman. yezhov could not immediately be reached for comment. the sbu said in a statement that the official was recruited by russian agents while he traveled abroad. it said the official had been collecting information about the activities of the government. ukraine and russia were once allies whose intelligence agencies often worked closely together, but relations deteriorated after russia s annexation of crimea in 2014 and support for pro russian separatists in eastern ukraine.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on friday: u.s. britain trump says he wants good relations with russia and declined to say whether he was ready to lift sanctions on moscow, which visiting british prime minister theresa may said must stay in place. u.s. mexico a day after mexican president enrique pena nieto canceled a washington trip, trump says they had a friendly phone call but asserted he will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of the countries’ ties because mexico has “beat us to a pulp” in the past. the white house says that trump and pena nieto recognized their differences on trump’s plan to build a wall on the southern u.s. border but have agreed to “work these differences out.” trump is poised to sign an executive order on friday to temporarily halt refugees from some muslim majority nations from entering the united states, a white house official says. trump’s executive order taking away federal funding from “sanctuary cities” has an exemption for one of his favorite constituencies, the police, who would be protected from cuts. but opponents say that could be grounds for a legal challenge. u.s. russia trump and russian president vladimir putin are likely to discuss the sanctions that washington imposed on russia over the conflict in ukraine when the two leaders speak by telephone on saturday, a senior white house aide says. u.s. senator john mccain, addressing speculation about lifting sanctions, hopes the administration will reject that “reckless course” and calls putin a murderer and thug.  vice president mike pence fires up tens of thousands of anti abortion activists in washington for the 44th march for life, celebrating a political shift in their favor with trump’s election. u.s. u.n. nikki haley, the new u.s. ambassador to the united nations, pledges to overhaul the world body and warns u.s. allies that if they do not support washington, then she is “taking names” and will respond. trump’s move to revive the keystone xl oil pipeline is part of his plan to boost u.s. drillers and create new u.s. jobs, but the project’s biggest winners may be canadian. vice president mike pence reportedly tells republicans a “full evaluation of voting rules” will likely be part of the trump administration’s investigation into what the president claims is widespread voting fraud.

" european countries will do their utmost to preserve a deal limiting iran s nuclear program despite misgivings by u.s. president donald trump, a senior european union diplomat said on wednesday.  this is not a bilateral agreement, it s a multilateral agreement. as europeans, we will do everything to make sure it stays,  helga schmid, secretary general of the eu s foreign policy service, told an iranian investment conference in switzerland s financial capital. the deal was brokered in 2015 by the bloc between iran, the united states, france, germany, britain, russia and china. trump is weighing whether the pact serves u.s. security interests as he faces an oct. 15 deadline for certifying that iran is complying, a decision that could sink an agreement strongly supported by the other world powers that negotiated it. schmid said europe has concerns about iran s role in regional affairs, but that those issues were not part of the nuclear accord known as the joint comprehensive plan of action.  i m absolutely convinced we will not be in a better place to address any of these issues by ditching the jcpoa,  schmid said.  the world does not need a second nuclear proliferation crisis. one is already too many,  she added in an apparent reference to washington s standoff with north korea. nicholas hopton, britain s ambassador to iran, said the u.n. nuclear watchdog s reports had shown iran was fully complying with terms of the accord.  we hope that president trump will recertify the deal and that the u.s. will continue to play a constructive and important role in the implementation of the jcpoa,  he told the conference. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday the united states should consider staying in the iran deal unless it were proven that tehran was not abiding by the agreement or that it was not in the u.s. national interest to do so. although mattis said he supported trump s review of the agreement, the defense secretary s view was far more positive than that of trump, who has called the deal agreed between iran and six world powers an  embarrassment.

" philadelphia mayor jim kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 u.s. public officials who took on the powerful u.s. soda industry when the city council voted on thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks.  after a bitter, months long battle, the city council voted 13 4 to approve a 1.5 cent per ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in january. the council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week, and the outcome had not been expected to change.  the city of brotherly love became the biggest u.s. city to have such a tax. much smaller berkeley, california, was the first. similar efforts, including several spearheaded by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the american beverage association, which opposes the philadelphia move and represents coca cola co and pepsico inc.  following thursday’s vote, the aba said it would take legal action to stop the tax.  the philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes. but experts noted those concerns were not the focus for kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that “nanny state” public health measures intrude on residents’ personal lives. instead, kenney rewrote the soda tax advocate’s playbook. he played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the city’s depleted coffers. in the first year, the tax is projected to raise $91 million, and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre kindergarten. “if you want to tax something and people know where the money’s going to go, then it’s easier for them to get behind it,” kenney said in an interview. he noted that focusing on revenue, rather than health, was largely responsible for the measure’s passage.  the strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in san francisco, neighboring oakland, california, and boulder, colorado. residents of those cities will vote in november on similar taxes, which could deal further blows to a u.s. soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption. u.s. soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015, according to euromonitor data.  bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as new york city mayor between 2002 and 2013. he moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants, ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants. on soda, he pushed for a tax, then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps, and finally a much lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks. his efforts were ultimately rejected, with critics decrying the moves toward a “nanny state.”  the strategy worked in britain, where a new soft drinks levy was announced in march after officials emphasized the country’s obesity crisis, saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state funded health system.  that approach never worked in philadelphia. michael nutter, the previous mayor, twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall. he was unable to push it through the city council. “twice before it was used in philadelphia and it was not successful. it was used in new york and it was not effective,” said kenney, adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not “less important,” they are less tangible.  kenney, who became mayor in january, had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre kindergarten, and he kept that issue as his focus. a spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal. bloomberg personally contributed funding to support philadelphia’s pro tax campaigners.  opponents of philadelphia’s soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda.  a spokesman for no philly grocery tax, a local aba funded group, said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the “unconstitutional” tax, but was still analyzing all its legal options. in a statement, it called the tax “regressive and discriminatory.”  kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry.  “it’s the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting, and that’s their problem now,” kenney said. “you’re going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort.”  in colorado, boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs, and san francisco and oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention.  when berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014, industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the city’s largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures. but philadelphia is the fifth largest u.s. city, with 1.6 million people. “no one can trivialize it as they can trivialize berkeley,” said larry tramutola, a california political strategist who worked on the berkeley campaign and is currently leading the san francisco and oakland efforts.

" the chief executive officers of two major american companies   retailer target corp and agribusiness archer daniels midland co   offered opposing views in a hearing before u.s. lawmakers on tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax. target ceo brian cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the republican backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside juan luciano, president and ceo of adm, who spoke in favor of the proposal. the border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by house republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. target is a big importer of goods, while adm exports. house speaker paul ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.  cornell and luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.  “under the new border adjustment tax, american families – your constituents – would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less,” cornell told the committee.  luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make american companies more competitive. “a competitive tax code will help us continue providing american made food and feed to our customers in the united states and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad,” he said. the outlook for passage of the border tax   which drew staunch opposition from retailers   remains perilous, especially as key senate republicans and president donald trump have refused to endorse it. several republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including republican representative jim renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports. dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform. the committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including william simon, the former ceo of wal mart stores inc, who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure. “we will see more good middle class jobs, a robust u.s. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution,” simon said. lawrence lindsey, the former director of the national economic council under president george w. bush, also supported the tax. economist kimberly clausing, of reed college, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.  “this is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime,” she said.

" the department of homeland security has prepared new guidance for immigration agents aimed at speeding up deportations by denying asylum claims earlier in the process.  the new guidelines, contained in a draft memo dated february 17 but not yet sent to field offices, directs agents to only pass applicants who have a good chance of ultimately getting asylum, but does not give specific criteria for establishing credible fear of persecution if sent home.   the guidance instructs asylum officers to ""elicit all relevant information"" in determining whether an applicant has ""credible fear"" of persecution if returned home, the first obstacle faced by migrants on the u.s. mexico border requesting asylum. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2m4apas) three sources familiar with the drafting of the guidance said the goal of the new instructions is to raise the bar on initial screening in order to ease strain on the courts and reduce the number of immigrants allowed to stay in the united states, often for years, while they await a hearing. the administration’s plan is to leave wide discretion to asylum officers by allowing them to determine which applications have a “significant possibility” of being approved by an immigration court, the sources said. the guidance was first reported and posted on the internet by mcclatchy news organization. in 2015, just 18 percent of asylum applicants whose cases were ruled on by immigration judges were granted asylum, according to the justice department. applicants from countries with a high rate of political persecution have a higher chance of winning their asylum cases.  a tougher approach to asylum seekers would be an element of president donald trump’s promise to crack down on immigration and tighten border security, a cornerstone of his election campaign and a top priority of his first month in office. the guidelines are contained in two draft memos signed by homeland security secretary john kelly and currently under review by the white house, according to two people familiar with them. the memos also outlined plans for greatly expanding the categories of people that immigration agents target for deportation, and gives them wide discretion in deciding who to deport. previously, recent arrivals and convicted criminals were the prime targets. the new plan would include migrants who have been charged but not convicted of crimes, and would also apply to illegal immigrants who have been in the country for many years. the memos also call for quickly hiring 10,000 more immigration and customs enforcement agents as well as 5,000 more border patrol agents. the dhs declined to comment for this story, referring questions to the white house, which did not respond to a request for comment. under the immigration and nationality act, an applicant must generally demonstrate “a well founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”   immigration lawyers say any applicants who appear to meet that criteria in their initial interviews should be allowed to make their cases in court. they oppose encouraging asylum officers to take a stricter stance on questioning claims and rejecting applications.  interviews to assess credible fear are conducted almost immediately after an asylum request is made, often at the border or in detention facilities by immigration agents or asylum officers, and most applicants easily clear that hurdle. between july and september of 2016, u.s. asylum officers accepted nearly 88 percent of the claims of credible fear, according to u.s. citizenship and immigration services data. asylum seekers who fail the credible fear test can be quickly deported unless they file an appeal. currently, those who pass the test are eventually released and allowed to remain in the united states awaiting hearings, which are often scheduled years into the future because of a backlog of more than 500,000 cases in immigration courts. between october 2015 and april 2016, nearly 50,000 migrants claimed credible fear, 78 percent of whom were from honduras, el salvador, guatemala or mexico, according to statistics from uscis.  the number of migrants from those three countries who passed credible fear and went to court to make their case for asylum rose sharply between 2011 and 2015, from 13,970 claims to 34,125, according to data from the justice department.  former border patrol chief mike fisher credits that trend to advice from immigration lawyers who know “asylum officers are going to err on the side of caution and refer most cases to a judge.”  the new guidance on asylum seekers is for border personnel implementing trump’s jan. 25 executive order on tightening u.s. border security.  among other measures, the president’s directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the united states and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected. some immigration officers familiar with the draft guidance say they are concerned that a rapid increase in deportations of asylum seekers could strain overcrowded detention facilities and create transportation problems.  deportations take time and coordination, even when immigrants are quickly targeted for expulsion. u.s. officials must get approval from a deportee’s home country before repatriation can take place, and transportation can be complicated and expensive. immigrants from non contiguous countries are flown home by plane, while mexicans are often bused across the border.   homeland security personnel who worked on the guidance say they hope to expand detention space by at least 8,000 beds. the money to pay for that would require congressional sign off. the extra beds, they say, would further the president’s goal, expressed in his executive order on border security, of ending the practice known as “catch and release” in which migrants, including asylum seekers, are freed pending a court hearing. the new guidance calls for expanding detention, but acknowledges that ending the practice “may not be immediately possible.”  a congressional aide familiar with the administration’s plans said dhs is considering expanding its contracts with private prison companies like geo group (geo.n) and corecivic (cxw.n), which currently hold most immigrant detainees. immigrants rights advocates say they fear that raising the bar on the credible fear test could screen out migrants with a rightful claim to asylum, because asylum officers may dismiss cases that could make it through court if the asylum seeker were given legal counsel, said marielena hincapie, executive director of the national immigration law center.     asylum applicants have the right to appeal denials of credible fear claims and may request to see a judge to assert their claim to be in the united states for other reasons, such as family ties. for that reason, raising the bar on credible fear might not deter asylum seekers as much as the trump administration hopes, said former border patrol head fisher.

" u.s. president elect donald trump vowed on wednesday to step back from running his global business empire to avoid conflicts of interest but gave few immediate details as concern over his dual role mounts ahead of his jan. 20 inauguration. trump, a real estate magnate who owns hotels and golf resorts from panama to scotland, said he would spell out at a dec. 15 news conference how he will separate himself “in total” from his worldwide business holdings, which include a winery, modeling agency and a range of other businesses. after trump won the nov. 8 election, his company, the trump organization, had said it was looking at new business structures with the goal of transferring control to donald trump jr., ivanka trump and eric trump   three of his adult children who are involved with the company. trump gave few details in a series of early morning tweets but said that “legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations” and that his children would attend the news conference. he did not say what the planned change might mean for ownership of his businesses. although trump’s fellow republicans generally take a more laissez faire stance toward business than democrats, the president elect will travel to indiana on thursday to formally announce a deal he reached with united technologies corp to keep close to 1,000 jobs at its carrier corp air conditioner plant in indianapolis rather than have them moved to mexico. trump and his running mate, mike pence, the governor of indiana, railed against carrier on the campaign trail, using the company’s outsourcing move as an example of how trade agreements hurt american workers.     critics have raised questions about the role of trump’s children, who are on the executive committee of his white house transition team. his daughter ivanka joined a telephone call her father had with argentine president mauricio macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe, creating concerns about possible conflicts of interest. a brand name around the globe, trump previously argued he had no need to separate himself from the trump organization, which includes a hotel down the street from the white house, a manhattan tower where he lives and is running his transition to office, and a new jersey golf course where he interviewed cabinet candidates earlier this month. trump said on wednesday he was not required by law to alter his relationship with his business, but added: “i feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.” as the republican heads toward taking over the white house from democratic president barack obama, scrutiny of potential conflicts has grown. democratic lawmakers on capitol hill called for hearings on the issue. rules on conflict of interest for executive branch employees do not apply to the president, but trump will be bound by bribery laws, disclosure rules and the u.s. constitution, which bars elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments. the nonpartisan office of government ethics, a government office that oversees ethics programs for the executive branch, issued a statement saying it applauded trump’s aims and appearing to suggest that he completely shed his holdings. “divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not,” it said. richard painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer to former republican president george w. bush, concurred.  “he needs to sell the businesses not just have someone else manage them for him,” painter, a professor at the university of minnesota law school, said in an emailed comment. trump, a former reality tv star, has spent much of the past few weeks setting up his cabinet and interviewing candidates for top jobs in his administration. on wednesday, trump said he would nominate his chief campaign fundraiser, steven mnuchin, to lead the u.s. treasury. mnuchin said the administration would make tax reform and trade pact overhauls top priorities as it seeks a sustained pace of 3 percent to 4 percent economic growth. mnuchin, a former goldman sachs banker, also signaled a desire to remove u.s. mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac from government ownership, a move that could have wide ranging ramifications for how americans pay for their homes, and said banking regulations should be eased to spur lending. trump named wilbur ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, as his nominee for commerce secretary. both nominees will require confirmation by the u.s. senate. trump is also considering goldman sachs president and chief operating officer gary cohn, a former commodities trader, to head his white house budget office or to fill another position, a trump transition official said. the economic picks were praised by the business roundtable, a group that represents america’s largest corporations. but u.s. senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren called mnuchin “just another wall street insider.” “that is not the type of change that donald trump promised to bring to washington   that is hypocrisy at its worst,” sanders, a vermont independent who ran for the 2016 democratic presidential nomination, and warren, a massachusetts democrat, said in a joint statement. trump pledged during his campaign to “drain the swamp” in washington. a spokesman said giving top economic jobs to wall street figures was not inconsistent with that vow. “you want some people that are insiders and understand the system and some outsiders that are creative thinkers, out of the box thinkers and disruptors,” said anthony scaramucci, an asset manager who is on trump’s transition committee. trump is also working to fill out his foreign policy team, but no decision appeared imminent on who the next secretary of state would be.

" lebanon s army will deploy along the country s entire eastern border with syria and remain stationed there after recently recapturing areas from islamic state militants, army chief general joseph aoun said on friday. the remarks appeared to confirm comments by the lebanese shi ite group hezbollah that it was handing over points it had controlled along the border to the military.  the army will deploy from now onwards along the extent of the eastern borders, to defend them,  aoun said at a ceremony commemorating lebanese soldiers killed by islamic state. an army offensive last month ended with the militants withdrawing from their last foothold along the border under a ceasefire deal. the syrian army and hezbollah fought the jihadists separately on the syrian side. hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said in july it would be ready to hand over territory it captured if the lebanese army requested it. hezbollah led a campaign in the same area that month to oust the nusra front jihadist group from their last foothold along the border. security sources said hezbollah had begun handing over points it controlled. iran backed hezbollah has played a critical role in vanquishing sunni muslim jihadists in the border region during the six year long syrian war, part of its military support for syrian president bashar al assad. the group, an ally of lebanese president michel aoun, was key to the defeat of militants in the qalamoun area further south in 2015, and at the syrian town of qusair, in 2013. lebanon s southern border with israel, a hezbollah foe, is patrolled by the united nations interim force in lebanon.

" u.s. senators reached an agreement on monday on legislation imposing new sanctions on russia, including a provision that would prevent the white house from easing, suspending or ending sanctions without congressional approval. the agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 u.s. election, annexation of ukraine’s crimea region and support for the government of syria in that country’s six year long civil war. [l1n1j41ls] the iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. besides the provision setting up a process for congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. it would impose new sanctions on russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to syria’s government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of russia’s government, among others. the measure also would allow new sanctions on russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. the legislation is backed by both republicans and democrats, and is expected to easily pass the senate. it was introduced amid an intense focus in the u.s. capital on relations with russia, and investigations by the department of justice and congressional committees of whether russia sought to influence the 2016 u.s. elections to help elect republican president donald trump, and whether trump associates colluded with moscow as it sought to influence the election.  to become law, the legislation would have to pass the house of representatives and be signed into law by trump. if trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto. “these additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a statement. russia has denied attempting to interfere in the u.s election, and trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. the measure also authorizes “robust assistance” to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in european countries that might be targeted by what the legislation’s sponsors described as russian aggression. in december, the final full month of president barack obama’s administration, washington sanctioned russian businessmen and companies for moscow’s role in ukraine via executive order.

" the u.s. senate armed services committee approved 4,000 more visas for afghans who worked for u.s. forces as interpreters or support staff on wednesday, an effort to preserve a program that had been at risk of shutting down. the committee included the additional visas in its version of the annual national defense authorization act (ndaa), a must pass piece of legislation that sets priorities for the department of defense budget for fiscal 2018, which will be about $650 billion. the senate and house of representatives are currently working on separate versions of the legislation, which must be reconciled and passed by both chambers and signed by president donald trump before it can become law. the afghan special immigrant visa (siv) program allows afghans who worked for the u.s. government, often risking their lives, to move to the united states after a rigorous vetting process. bipartisan pushes by u.s. lawmakers this year for more siv visas have come against the backdrop of efforts by the trump administration to clamp down on immigration from majority muslim countries. in march, the u.s. embassy in kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for siv applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, but lawmakers included 2,500 more in a  spending bill in april to preserve the program. “our nation owes a great debt to the civilians who have provided essential assistance to the u.s. mission in afghanistan, and i am very pleased that this legislation authorizes the necessary visas for these brave men and women,” said democratic senator jeanne shaheen, who led the push for the legislation with republican senator john mccain, the armed services committee’s chairman.

" kosovo s government considers the possibility of attacks by islamic state fighters returning from iraq and syria one of the main threats to national security, according to a new strategy document. around 300 kosovars have gone to syria and iraq since 2012 to fight with the islamic state group for the establishment of a caliphate ruled by islamic law. some 70 have been killed but many, including women and children, are still believed to be in the conflict zone, despite the group s expulsion from almost all the population centers it had held. the document,  state strategy against terrorism and action plan 2018 2022 , was posted on a government website on friday. it said potential threats included  attacks by members of terrorist organizations through foreign terrorist fighters, inactive cells, but also by sympathizers and supporters who may be inspired to commit violent acts . international and local security agencies have previously warned of the risk posed by returning fighters, and in 2015, kosovo adopted a law making fighting in foreign conflicts punishable by up to 15 years in jail. the report said there had been  public calls for terrorist attacks in kosovo and the region  and called terrorism  one of the biggest threats to national security . kosovo s population is nominally 90 percent muslim, but largely secular in outlook. there have been no islamist attacks on its soil, although in june, nine kosovar men were charged with planning attacks at a soccer match in albania against the visiting israeli national team and its fans the previous november. the state prosecutor said some of the men had been in contact with lavdrim muhaxheri, a prominent islamic state member and the self declared  commander of albanians in syria and iraq , from whom they had received orders to attack. muhaxheri was reported to have been killed in the syria the same month. the government strategy, compiled by the interior ministry, said that a form of radical islam had been imported to kosovo by non governmental organizations from the middle east after the end of its 1998 99 war of secession from serbia.

" south sudan s government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on thursday in the latest attempt to end a four year civil war and allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting. the ceasefire aims to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed last year after heavy fighting broke out in south sudan s capital juba. it was agreed after talks in the ethiopian capital addis ababa convened by regional bloc igad. a decision by president salva kiir to sack his deputy riek machar triggered the war in the world s youngest country. the war has been fought largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to kiir, who is dinka, and machar, who is nuer. tens of thousands have died and a third of the population of 12 million have fled their homes. the conflict has since mutated from a two way fight into one involving multiple parties and this has made it harder to find peace. representatives of kiir and machar were both present at the signing. south sudan s information minister michael makuei leuth told journalists:  the cessation of hostilities will be effective 72 hours from now. as of now, we will send messages to all the commands in the field to abide by this cessation of hostilities.   from now onwards, there will be no more fighting,  he added.  just talks.   i do hope in signing this agreement, you will try to put an end to this tragedy .... this is an encouraging first phase,  said moussa faki mahamat, chairperson of the african union commission. ethiopia s foreign minister workneh gebeyehu, also present, said:  there is no longer any excuse for the violations of human rights. all parties are obliged to observe cessation of hostilities agreement. diplomats at the talks told reuters the next phase of the negotiations would now center on thrashing out a revised power sharing arrangement leading up to a new date for polls. the united states, britain and norway, which form a group that supported a 2005 accord leading to the independence of south sudan from sudan, welcomed the agreement.  the troika ... congratulate the parties on their willingness to compromise for the benefit of the people of south sudan and hope that they immediately take action to make good on that agreement,  they said in a statement issued by the u.s. state department.

" cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the  temperature  of popular opinion and how people feel about each other, a senior chinese official said on friday, amid a freeze in cultural ties with south korea over an anti missile system. china has been angered by seoul s decision to deploy the u.s. made terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) system, saying that its powerful radar harms china s own national security and will do nothing to lessen tensions with north korea, which thaad is supposed to defend against. popular south korean soap operas have been pulled from streaming sites, k pop singers have had concerts canceled and there has been a dramatic drop in chinese tourists to south korea. china has not officially linked the moves to the thaad tensions, but has said relations need to have a  basis in popular opinion . asked about the prospects for cultural exchanges with south korea amid the thaad dispute, deputy media regulator zhang hongsen said cultural exchanges were not an  ordinary exchange of goods .  cultural exchanges relate to where the popular will inclines and to emotional choices,  he said, speaking on the sidelines of a communist party congress.  so what we say is that culture exchanges are an exchange of temperatures, and this temperature comes from popular feeling and emotion,  added zhang, who is a vice minister of the state administration of press, publication, radio, film and television.  when popular sentiments and emotions align, cultural exchanges and cooperation can certainly develop in a positive direction,  he said, without elaborating.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said on monday she will not accept an invitation from mexican president enrique pena nieto for a visit after rival donald trump created what she called a “diplomatic incident” in his foray there. in a written excerpt from an interview with abc news that will air tuesday morning, clinton simply said “no” when asked if she would travel to mexico before the election on nov. 8, without elaborating further. her campaign later confirmed her decision. “we understand and respect her decision to propose the time to hold a meeting,” said mexican foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu in a tweet, adding that contact with clinton’s campaign was ongoing. pena nieto extended invitations to both candidates last month, and trump flew to mexico city last wednesday for a meeting that appeared to be friendly but later revealed deep tensions. trump, the republican presidential nominee, has been highly critical of mexico, saying the country sends rapists and drug dealers to the united states. he has called for a wall to be built on the border that would be paid for by mexico.  trump said at a joint news conference with pena nieto that they did not discuss who would pay for the wall. pena nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on twitter that he made it clear mexico would not pay for the wall. “he came out saying one thing and the mexican president contradicted him almost immediately,” clinton, a former u.s. secretary of state, said in the abc interview. “he didn’t raise it, so he did choke. he didn’t know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state. and i think that’s a pretty clear outcome from that trip,” she added.

" iran s supreme court has upheld a death sentence against an iranian academic with swedish residency convicted of espionage, amnesty international and his family said on tuesday. ahmadreza djalali, a doctor and lecturer at the karolinska institute, a stockholm medical university, was accused of providing information to israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists. djalali was arrested in iran in april 2016 and later convicted of espionage. he denied the charges, amnesty said.  at least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what tehran said was a program of assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy. western powers and israel said iran aimed to build a nuclear bomb. tehran denied this. the islamic republic hanged a man in 2012 over the killings, saying he had links to israel. djalali s lawyers were told on saturday that the supreme court had considered his case and upheld his oct. 24 sentence in a secret process without allowing them to file defense submissions, london based amnesty said.  this is not only a shocking assault on the right to a fair trial but is also in utter disregard for ahmadreza djalali s right to life,  magdalena mughrabi, amnesty s deputy director for the middle east and north africa, said in a statement. vida mehrannia, djalali s wife, said the whole family were in shock at the decision and that they had informed the swedish government about the latest development in the case.  the judicial process was not fair and legal from the beginning. none of the court sessions was held in public and the interrogators imposed their decision on the judges,  she told reuters by telephone from stockholm. the iranian judiciary could not be reached for comment.  amnesty said in october that the court verdict against djalali stated he had worked with the israeli government which then helped him obtain a swedish residency permit. djalali was on a business trip to iran when he was arrested and sent to evin prison. he was held in solitary confinement for three months of his detention and tortured, amnesty said.  it said djalali wrote a letter inside evin last august stating he was being held for refusing to spy for iran. sweden condemned the sentence in october and said it had raised the matter with iranian envoys in stockholm and tehran. seventy five nobel prize laureates petitioned iranian authorities last month to release djalali so he could  continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind . they said djalali has suggested it was his refusal to work for iranian intelligence services that led to this  unfair, flawed trial . the united nations and international human rights organizations regularly list iran as a country with one of the world s highest execution rates. rights groups have criticized iran for its regular resort to capital punishment.

" deportations of undocumented mexican migrants in the united states may start rising when president elect donald trump takes office but the process will not begin soon, mexico’s deputy interior minister for migration said on wednesday. trump surged to victory early on wednesday morning after upsetting pollsters’ predictions to beat democratic rival hillary clinton and seize the white house in a campaign that sent the world into uncertainty. the impact of his win was particularly acute in mexico, where the beleaguered peso currency fell about 10 percent in the aftermath of the vote. trump, who will be inaugurated jan. 20, has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, fence off mexico with a border wall and threatened to rip up the north american free trade agreement, putting in danger billions of dollars in cross border trade. “it may well be that deportations of the estimated 6 million undocumented mexicans increase but we don’t think it will be a measure that will take place soon or happen quickly,” humberto roque villanueva, the deputy interior minister for migration, told reuters in an interview. “the mexicans over there are useful to the north american economy and president trump, the president elect, will need to recognize the economic effects of such a campaign promise,” he said. roque villanueva also said mexico stands ready to lobby the u.s. congress and use all legal means possible to block trump’s plan for impounding remittances so that mexico ends up paying for his proposed wall on the southern u.s. border. “they wouldn’t be retaliatory measures. they would be legal responses,” he said. “we’ll be ready for all the craziness.” ",0
" the unraveling of the coalition that was supposed to carry hillary clinton to the white house had a lot to do with voters like jim mcandrew in counties like northampton, pennsylvania. mcandrew, 69, a retired steel worker, voted democrat in every presidential election for half a century. this year he stayed home. and northampton county, a heavily white, heavily democratic, largely working class area that backed president barack obama in 2008 and 2012, went for donald trump, a republican. mcandrew, who voted for obama in the two previous races, was intrigued by trump, but decided eventually that “all he does is insult everybody ... women, black people, white people, rich, poor. he’s an idiot.” he considered clinton, but was concerned by the scandal over her handling of classified material on a private email server as secretary of state. “i hated both of them, so i just said, ‘the hell with it,’” mcandrew said. his wife, also a life long democrat, went to the polls without him   and voted republican.  “first time ever,” he said. trump’s ability to flip reliably democratic counties like northampton helped drive his victory in the presidential election this week. it was critical to his win in pennsylvania and other rust belt states, a bulwark in the democrats’ electoral strategy for winning the white house, and it helped fuel his victories in critical swing states, such as florida and north carolina. it’s not that trump’s economic populism and “america first” messages generated widespread enthusiasm; he won some of those counties with far fewer votes than mitt romney captured as the republican nominee in 2012. nationwide, trump’s 59.7 million votes are about 1.2 million behind the 60.9 million romney got when he lost four years ago, based on initial projections. but clinton’s troubles holding on to democratic voters were far more stark. some crossed party lines for trump or backed an independent.  many just stayed home.  clinton won the popular vote with 59.9 million votes, 6 million fewer than the 65.9 million obama won in 2012. and her weakness in traditionally democratic areas helped cost her the electoral college that chooses the winner of the election. clinton came across as a status quo candidate unlikely to shake up the washington establishment, says mike sly, 74, a retiree and independent voter in pinellas county, florida, who backed obama in 2012 and voted for trump this year. clinton’s message failed to convince him that she would address his concerns about the state of the economy and rising health insurance premiums under obama’s affordable care act. the race “came down to basically what change do i think is going to happen, and how i think it is going to happen,” sly says. “i felt that hillary really carried too much baggage to be trusted.” clinton’s loss in florida, a key battleground state, stemmed partly from her inability to hold voters like sly in white, middle  and working class areas that previously went democrat. in vote rich pinellas, a beach community popular with retirees in the tampa bay region, trump won 48 percent of the vote, besting clinton’s 47 percent. in 2012, obama won 52 percent. nationally, initial projections show low voter turnout of just over 55 percent, the worst since the contested election of 2000, when republican george w. bush defeated then democratic vice president al gore. in obama’s first victory, turnout was more than 62 percent. clinton beat trump among black and hispanic voters, but her effort to forge a winning coalition by leveraging that strength in diverse, urban areas was upended by trump’s strength among whites. meanwhile, trump still managed to hold roughly the same level of minority support that romney got in 2012. the pattern held true not only in rural areas, but also in many suburbs, particularly in the rust belt and the south, that tipped towards obama in the previous two presidential races. “it was pretty much a base election, but one group was better at turning out their voters than the other,” says susan macmanus, a university of south florida political science professor. in gates county, north carolina, trump’s vows to crack down on illegal immigration and police muslim communities for radicalism resonated, says eric j. earhart, 49, pastor of the evangelical upper room assembly church. “there has been a definite shift over the past eight years away from us being a judeo christian nation,” earhart adds, and many congregants worry about that. the rural county of 12,000 people went for obama in 2012 with 52 percent of the vote, but it flipped into trump’s column in this year’s race, giving him 53 percent. thomas hill, 38, chairman of the gates county republican party, says voters also were attracted to trump’s blunt speaking and his pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs that went overseas.  trump’s economic message, which included a promise to kill free trade agreements that are unpopular among many working class voters in industrial areas, also succeeded in macomb county, michigan, a predominantly white area north of detroit. the number of voters casting ballots in the county jumped by more than 14,000 over 2012, and trump captured 53 percent of the vote to clinton’s 42 percent. four years ago, obama won the county with just under 52 percent of the vote.  “you’ve got a lot of blue collar workers here (and) ... a lot of union guys, and they went republican,” says david phair, 59, a construction worker and trump voter who didn’t cast a ballot in 2012. “they’re tired of politicians.” phair also liked trump’s promise to end illegal immigration. “i’m looking forward to how he’s going to handle illegal aliens.” in pennsylvania, northampton county and neighboring lehigh county, once reliant on steel companies, have bounced back from the industry’s decline. in bethlehem, which straddles the two counties, new development has mushroomed around the old steel mill, including a sands casino resort with 2,400 employees.  e commerce companies, white collar firms and big corporations, such as olympus, the japanese imaging giant, have also  moved to the region. lehigh and northampton counties have a larger share of households than the state as a whole that earn more than $75,000, about 36 percent. all that suggests ripe country for clinton. but the counties also are whiter and older than the country as a whole.  and trump dominated voting among older whites. around the table where mcandrew has a weekly poker game in the basement of the united steel workers office in bethlehem, the retired men of the city’s steel mills have different opinions on why clinton failed to match obama’s success in the region. but they agree that she didn’t offer a compelling message. among the five at the table, all lifelong democrats, only three cast votes for clinton. “she was going to continue everything the way it is and a lot of people think there are things that need to be changed,” says ken rayden, 80, who voted for clinton, but mainly out of party loyalty. “she didn’t show the people anything new.” ",0
" president donald trump will propose $200 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years in his first budget on tuesday   funding the administration believes will boost private, state and local spending on projects, a white house official said on friday. the infrastructure plan, first reported by bloomberg news, is likely to include funding to encourage state and local governments to lease assets to the private sector to generate funding for other projects. trump has long pledged a $1 trillion, 10 year plan to modernize u.s. roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and water systems, but has so far been vague on how much of the spending would come from the federal government. trump, who leaves on friday for his first foreign trip, will miss the roll out of his full budget. he was to meet with his budget director, mick mulvaney, on friday before departing. the budget will also include details about trump’s proposals to cut foreign aid and boost military spending. it could provide clues on his plan to cut taxes. the washington post reported that the budget will include funds for a program to give parents six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child, expected to cost about $25 billion a year. while trump can propose programs, congress ultimately controls spending and rarely approves white house budget plans as proposed. republicans control both the senate and house of representatives, but were lukewarm to trump’s initial “skinny budget” plan for fiscal 2018, released in march.

" linkedin cofounder reid hoffman said on tuesday that republican presidential candidate donald trump would have a “terrifying” effect on domestic and foreign policy if elected. the comments came one day after hoffman published an article on medium.com pledging support to a crowdpac crowdfunding campaign that promises to donate to veterans causes if trump releases his tax returns.  hoffman said in his article that he will match five times the crowdfunded amount to donate up to $5 million. the campaign has raised more than $90,000. hoffman told a crowd at techcrunch disrupt 2016 in san francisco that he was “in denial” about the possibility of a trump presidency but encouraged by efforts to hold the candidate accountable.  trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  trump is facing criticism for not releasing tax returns, a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every white house nominee since 1973. his campaign last week released 10 years of returns for vice presidential nominee mike pence and repeated a pledge that trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit. “when i saw the campaign … i said that’s exactly the right way to make this message, a message in support of folks who have given great service to our country. if donald trump is as concerned with making america great as he says he is he should care about veterans,” hoffman said.

" an egyptian court on saturday sentenced ousted president mohammed mursi of the muslim brotherhood to 25 years in prison in a final ruling over a case accusing him of spying for qatar, judicial sources said. mursi, democratically elected after egypt s 2011 revolution, was overthrown in mid 2013 by then general abdel fattah al sisi, now the president, following mass protests against his rule. he was immediately arrested. egypt s court of cassation reduced mursi s sentence in the qatar case to 25 years in its final ruling, from an original 40 years.  mursi is already serving a 20 year sentence after being convicted for the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012. since toppling mursi, sisi has clamped down on dissent. mass trials have been held for thousands of muslim brotherhood supporters, and hundreds have received death sentences or lengthy prison terms. in 2014, egypt charged mursi and nine others with endangering national security by leaking state secrets and sensitive documents to qatar. egypt s relations with doha were already troubled by qatar s backing of mursi. egypt is one of four arab nations in a saudi led bloc that cut relations with the gulf state on june 5, accusing it of backing militant groups and cooperating with their arch foe iran, allegations doha denies.

" yemen s ex president ali abdullah saleh appears to have patched up a violent rift with his allies in the armed houthi movement, but the drama has left friends and foe alike wondering anew at the wily political survivor s next move. forming a surprise alliance with the houthis when they seized the capital sanaa in 2014, saleh s army loyalists and houthi fighters have together weathered thousands of air strikes by a saudi led military coalition in 2 1/2 years of war. fearing the houthis are a proxy for their arch foe iran, the mostly gulf arab alliance seeks to help the internationally recognized government push up from a base in yemen s south toward sanaa. saleh s guile has been key to resisting the push. for 34 years saleh ruled over one of the world s most heavily armed and tribal societies with expertly balanced doses of largesse and force. he battled the houthis for a decade in office before he befriended them when out of power. cornered by pro democracy  arab spring  protests, saleh wore a cryptic smile when signing his resignation in a televised ceremony in 2012. then as now, few could discern his intentions. but his desire to preserve by any means necessary his influence and that of his family   many of whom occupy top military positions   seems beyond doubt. his influence has outlived that of other arab leaders left dead or deposed by uprisings and civil wars since 2011. as the conflict has wrought a humanitarian crisis, weeks of mutual sniping about responsibility for economic woes in northern yemeni lands that they together rule peaked with a deadly gun battle between houthi and saleh supporters last week. leaders from saleh s former ruling party and the houthis met and pronounced the split healed. though they pledged to focus on the war effort against yemen s internationally recognized government that is backed by the saudi led coalition, the tensions suggest saleh is seeking to stake out his own political strategy as exhaustion sets in on all sides.   saleh wants to capitalize on popular opposition to both the houthis and the government, positioning himself as an alternative,  said adam baron, a yemen expert at the european council on foreign relations (ecfr). the war has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced 2 million from their homes, led to widespread hunger and a cholera epidemic which has left 2,000 people dead. militias and yemen s powerful al qaeda branch have gained ground in the chaos. any total breakdown within the alliance between saleh and the houthis would be bloody and pit scores of local leaders, tribesmen and army units cultivated by saleh for decades against others loyal to the fighters. saleh appeared eager to avoid that showdown in an interview which aired on monday on yemen today, a tv channel he owns.  there is no crisis or disagreement at all except in the imaginations of trouble makers and sowers of discord at home and abroad,  he said. but the ex leader, at times referring to himself in the third person, said that  imbalances  remained in the alliance, suggesting not all wounds had been salved. analysts say he remains annoyed at the continued existence of a houthi  revolutionary committee  which ruled alone before its alliance was formalized with saleh s general people s congress party in a  governing council  where they shared power.  anxiety also flares over appointments of local officials and control over financial policy   both former gpc prerogatives. beyond local squabbles, the good relations saleh enjoyed with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates during his presidency raise houthi fears of a grand double cross. saleh s son, ahmed ali, lives under house arrest in the uae where he once served as ambassador before it joined its ally saudi arabia to make war on the houthi saleh alliance. a powerful former military chief whom his father appeared to be grooming to succeed him, ahmed ali and the passing of saleh power to the next generation may figure into his calculus.  he certainly wants to secure a place for his family in any post war order ... the houthis are very paranoid that saleh may cut a deal with saudi arabia and the uae that will leave them out to dry,  baron of ecfr added. saleh has denied seeking to advance his son s political career or any backroom dealing with their enemies. to salvage their alliance, the houthis will need to convince saleh that despite their violent history, they make for stronger allies than some gpc members   like saleh s successor, president abd rabbu mansour hadi   who turned on him in the past.  i say to president saleh, out of sincerity and love, beware of these snakes,  houthi official hamid rizq wrote on his facebook page on tuesday.  they are the ones who pushed you to fight wars against the honorable and loyal people in your society then abandoned you and called you are a thief and a criminal.

" the senate passed the first broad energy bill in nine years on wednesday, legislation containing modest measures popular with both republicans and democrats to modernize the power grid and speed the permitting process for liquefied natural gas exports.  the bill, which passed 85 12, attempts to protect the power grid from extreme weather events such as ice storms and hurricanes, and from cyber attacks. it also aims to spur innovations in storage of power from wind and solar energy. the house of representatives passed a similar bill last year. the energy policy and modernization act would increase u.s. exports of liquefied natural gas (lng), eventually helping to give european consumers alternatives to relying mainly on russia for gas.    after disagreements held the bill up for months, senators last week dropped measures from the bill to aid flint, michigan overcome a drinking water crisis, in which children have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, and on offshore drilling.   lawmakers from both the house and senate will next iron out differences over the bill. the senate bill, for instance, requires the department of energy to issue a decision on lng projects within 45 days of an environmental assessment, while the house bill directs the doe to make the decision on permits after 30 days. senator maria cantwell, a democrat from washington state who co sponsored the bill, said shortly before it passed that she hoped the chambers would move quickly “so that we can realize the opportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy future.”  the white house has signaled that president barack obama would sign the senate bill.  energy policy analyst kevin book of clearview energy partners said the chances the bill would be signed into law this year were about 65 percent, because the white house has had some differences with the house bill.  charlie riedl, the head of industry group the center for liquefied natural gas, said the vote was a “big step forward” and that certainty about the regulatory process is “crucial” for projects that cost billions of dollars to build.  rob cowin, director of government affairs at the union of concerned scientists, a nonprofit group, said the bill falls “far short” of what is needed to promote wind and solar power, but is “better than doing nothing.” the senate on tuesday passed several amendments to the bill, including restricting most sales from the strategic petroleum reserve when oil prices are low.

" ask john mica why he sticks by donald trump, amid the defections of many fellow republicans, and the u.s. congressman from central florida instead touts his own work on easing traffic congestion in this tourism mecca. ask again about his support for trump and the mild mannered mica shows subtle signs of becoming annoyed. mica has become adept at tiptoeing around trump questions as his support for the controversial presidential candidate complicates his effort to extend a 24 year reign in congress. the race between mica and his democratic challenger, newcomer stephanie murphy, 38, could be a bellwether for republicans who seek to support the party’s presidential nominee while maintaining a safe distance from some of trump’s more controversial positions and alleged bad behavior.  the course of the campaign could provide clues on whether republicans maintain control of the house of representatives in a year in which trump has shaken his party and the political world with his bombast.  voters in his orlando district “don’t care about all this garbage that’s going on” in the presidential race, says mica, as he steers the conversation to improving healthcare for military veterans, creating jobs and expanding local airports. mica’s re election bid is also made unusually tough because of a newly drawn congressional district that gives democrats hope of a win.  murphy has sought to use mica’s support for trump against him by saying that just as mica has stuck with trump too long, he follows republican leaders in congress all too often. she ticks off mica’s support for gun positions pushed by the powerful national rifle association, especially after june’s massacre in orlando of 49 people at a gay nightclub. murphy has said mica is out of step with the reconfigured district, which she said is “evenly split” and not especially partisan.  as mica campaigns on his ability to deliver goods to his district in the form of job creation and infrastructure investment, democrats are making sure to remind voters that he is aligned with the man who arguably is one of the most controversial major party presidential candidates in history. democrats punctuate that with a photo of trump and mica side by side at a 2014 ceremony celebrating the start of construction of a trump hotel in washington. early trends of mail in ballots in the 7th congressional district point to a competitive race. in orange county, 10,975 democrats have cast early votes compared to only 6,732 republicans and 3,525 independents. orlando may be famous as the home of the fantasy land that is disney world. but mica’s district is a real life mirror of america. its residents are politically divided, in this case about evenly split between republicans and democrats and with a strong dose of independent voters. furthermore, as in other parts of the country, latino voters in central florida are building political muscle. as mica, 73, wages a ground war that has him knocking on constituents’ doors in orlando’s heat and humidity, he walks a fine line. he is a grandson of immigrants who boasts of being “hard nosed” against “amnesty” for the 11 million immigrants in the united states illegally. but he suggests there could be exceptions to trump’s promise to deport them all. building a wall on the southern border with mexico, a linchpin of trump’s campaign, should be done “where it makes sense,” mica said during an interview with reuters amid a lunchtime crowd of mainly hispanic customers at the lechonera el barrio restaurant. still, as prominent republicans offended by the tenor of trump’s campaign, including house speaker paul ryan, distance themselves from trump, mica stands firm, saying, “i’m pretty much a party loyalist.” such loyalty can come with a price, though, and mica acknowledges, “i’m stuck with the republican (presidential) nominee” whom he said made “vulgar, reprehensible” remarks about sexual advances on women captured in a 2005 videotape that recently became public. but there is an upside to supporting trump as well. mica said some supporters want to know that he is sticking with the nominee. “these people are very passionate. they’re going to be voting,” he said. miriam ramirez, a former republican legislator in puerto rico who lives part time in florida and has been stumping for mica, worries trump could complicate mica’s re election.  asked whether mica’s appeal to the district’s booming puerto rican population could suffer because of his association with trump,  ramirez said, “yes, especially in lower income families.” murphy, who came to the united states as a child after she and her family escaped vietnam and were adrift in the south china sea before being rescued by the u.s. navy, said trump’s “hateful and divisive rhetoric” has voters worried that he “will act on the prejudices he has laid out” if elected. “voters choose political leaders they believe will do the best for them but also represent the best in them,” murphy said, challenging mica’s support of trump. one thing seems certain in the closing weeks of the campaign: mica is staying on message as he tiptoes around trump, instead talking about the “interstate (highway) massive rebuild” and the airport in seminole county that “had weeds growing up...out of the runway” and now supports thousands of jobs.

" u.s. president donald trump took a conciliatory tone on saturday at a meeting with chinese president xi jinping where the leaders agreed to keep working on two pressing issues: the nuclear threat posed by north korea and bilateral trade irritants. trump campaigned in last year’s presidential election on cracking down on china for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with china on the nuclear issue. when the two leaders first met in april at trump’s florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. trump called xi a “good man” as he urged him to use beijing’s economic clout to force north korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. lately, trump has expressed some impatience on china’s role in north korea   particularly after pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach alaska, and parts of the u.s. west coast. his administration made new arms sales to taiwan, imposed sanctions on two chinese citizens and a shipping company and put china on a global human trafficking list. it also accused a chinese bank of laundering money for pyongyang. the white house is also debating trade actions against beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the g20 talks, trump complained that trade between china and north korea had grown.  but he showed none of that impatience on saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of xi at the tail end of the g20 in germany. “it’s an honor to have you as a friend,” trump told xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on north korea. “as far as north korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. it may take longer than i’d like. it may take longer than you’d like. but there will be success in the end one way or the other,” trump said. speaking to reporters later on air force one, u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the trump xi meeting lasted over an hour and a half, and they had “substantive discussions” about how to deal with north korea together. “in regards to china, we had very direct discussions about north korea. we had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation,” mnuchin said.   “i think that president trump made very clear to president xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. and i think president xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint,” he added.    for his part, xi told trump that stronger china u.s. ties were conducive to stability and prosperity amid global conflicts, and had made “new progress” in some areas “despite some sensitive issues”, xi said, according to state news agency xinhua. xi stressed the importance of talks with north korea, and said china’s navy will join next year’s u.s. led pacific rim military exercises. xinhua said xi stressed to trump china’s position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. while china has been angered by north korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the united states and south korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. “china has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to north korean acts that go against u.n. security council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation,” xinhua said, citing xi. xi also reiterated china’s opposition to the u.s. deployment of the terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) anti missile system in south korea, xinhua said. china says thaad threatens its security, despite u.s. and south korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against north korea. both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the korean peninsula nuclear issue, xinhua said. in a statement released on sunday, chinese foreign minister wang yi said xi and trump had “enhanced mutual understanding” about the north korea issue and “confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue”. trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with xi, calling it a “very, very big issue” that he would address. “i know that china in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal,” trump said. senior officials from both countries will meet in washington on july 19 to discuss economic and trade issues.

" a plan to raise california’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 cleared its first legislative hurdle on wednesday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. the measure, incorporating a deal governor jerry brown reached with labor leaders and fellow democrats in the legislature, was approved on a party line vote of 12 7 by the assembly appropriations committee, where a previous version of the bill had stalled last summer. one democrat, tom daly, joined six republicans in opposing the measure, which now advances to the full assembly for action as early as this week. it would then return to the senate for a final vote. if enacted, the bill would put california, home to one of the world’s biggest economies, in the vanguard of a growing number of u.s. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. supporters say such measures are necessary to help low paid workers who have been slipping into poverty due to stagnant earnings and rising living expenses. opponents say raising the mandatory wage floor puts undue strain on businesses still struggling to rebound from a prolonged u.s. economic slump. the measure would gradually raise california’s hourly minimum wage from the current level of $10 to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. it also would head off a pair of competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend the increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for brown. raising the minimum wage has cropped up on many democratic candidates’ agendas ahead of the november elections, and the issue could help galvanize supporters at the polls. but passage is not assured without backing from more moderate democrats, including business friendly assembly members in swing districts who have recently held up bills that were priorities for the party’s progressive wing, including a plan to cut the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. according to the governor’s office, 2.2 million californians earn the state minimum wage of $10 an hour. the bill would ultimately benefit 5.6 million workers, raising their wages by an average of 24 percent, according to an analysis from the university of california, berkeley. retail employees account for 16 percent of affected workers, and restaurant employees 15 percent.

" britain s government has not yet decided what it wants from a final brexit deal because it is still waiting to clear preliminary talks with brussels, finance minister philip hammond said on wednesday. with the clock ticking towards britain s scheduled march 2019 exit from the european union, the government is focused at the moment on getting a green light for the negotiations on future trade relations with the eu, hammond said.  the cabinet has had general discussions about our brexit negotiations but we haven t had a specific mandating of an end state position,  he told lawmakers in britain s parliament. prime minister theresa may s top ministers have big differences over what brexit should mean for britain, and over the extent of concessions that the country should offer in return for preferential access to the eu s single market. hammond said a group of key government ministers would deal with the issue once britain is given the go ahead by other eu countries that it can proceed with negotiations for a new, post brexit trade deal. that go ahead is on hold pending an agreement by the bloc s other 27 member states that britain has done enough on the terms of its divorce, now stuck on differences over how open the future border between ireland and northern ireland should be.  we are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to  have that discussion until we reach that stage,  hammond told parliament s treasury committee. a spokesman for may, asked about hammond s comments, told reporters that government ministers would discuss the preferred outcome of the brexit talks before the end of the year.  we re not into phase two (of negotiations) yet, and brussels have been clear that they re not prepared to discuss  end state ,  the spokesman said. earlier on wednesday brexit minister david davis inflamed critics of the government s handling of brexit when he said he had not conducted formal sector by sector analyses of the effect of brexit on the economy, arguing they were not yet necessary. hammond has previously said he favors striking a  pragmatic  deal with the eu to minimize brexit s impact on businesses and the economy, angering some brexit supporters who favor a more definitive rupture with brussels. on wednesday, hammond reiterated that britain would leave the eu s single market and its customs union but that need not represent a big change to britain s relationship with the bloc, if britain replicates most of the current arrangements.  now, that would have consequences and some of our colleagues would not find that palatable, but it would be logically possible to approach it in that way,  he said. may hopes to secure the launch of the second phase of the brexit negotiations when she meets other eu leaders next week. but she suffered a setback this week when her allies in a political party from northern ireland objected to proposals for post brexit rules for the border with ireland. the democratic unionist party said on wednesday the stand off increased the likelihood of a  no deal  brexit   the nightmare scenario for many british businesses.

" the investigation into alleged ties between president donald trump’s election campaign and russia is threatening to dampen already flagging momentum for the president’s legislative agenda of rolling back obamacare and overhauling the tax code.  with the senate convening on monday and the house of representatives on tuesday for a legislative sprint leading up to an august recess, the spotlight is on james comey, the fbi director fired by trump on may 9. comey, who will appear before the senate intelligence committee on thursday, will be grilled on whether trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president’s 2016 campaign and russia. trump, a republican, has called the russia probe a “witch hunt” designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. the russia matter presents a double barreled threat to congressional republicans: it could impede healthcare and tax initiatives that already were languishing and it could hurt efforts to hold onto their majorities in the house and senate in 2018 midterm elections. “it’s an enormous distraction and it creates uncertainty,” said veteran republican representative tom cole in a telephone interview. “it casts a pall over the political system and slows things down. you don’t want to slow things down when you have all three levers of power,” cole said, referring to the white house, senate and house. the day before comey’s scheduled testimony, top u.s. intelligence officials are set to appear before the same panel to discuss renewal of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, or fisa, which allows the government to collect communications of foreigners thought to be living overseas whose communications pass through american phone or internet providers. but senators are likely to also wade into the russia affair. [nl1n1iz0vv] lawmakers must also come up with a plan to raise the country’s debt limit. treasury secretary steven mnuchin is clamoring for congress to quickly approve more borrowing authority as the incoming stream of tax revenues slows. republican fiscal conservatives routinely demand budget cuts and other concessions as a price for raising the debt limit, setting up a likely fight. [nl1n1iz13f] amid all this, trump and his fellow republicans in congress hope the new work session, following a week long memorial day break, will be a chance to ‘reset’ the conversation in washington that has centered on russia and their failures so far on healthcare and tax legislation. house republicans hope this week to pass a repeal of portions of the 2010 dodd frank financial reform law. but that bill will face resistance in the senate, where democrats are expected to use procedural tactics to kill it. even so, house republicans hope passage of ‘low hanging fruit’ bills like this will allow them to argue that they have racked up accomplishments when they go home to their districts in august. meanwhile, the senate is struggling to craft legislation repealing and replacing obamacare, former president barack obama’s landmark law that expanded health insurance coverage to millions and placed new controls on insurers. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, in a may 24 interview with reuters said, “i don’t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment” but pledged to forge ahead. senators this week are expected to be presented with  options for a new healthcare program they hope will be more acceptable to voters than one passed by the house. [nber4wkzcm] failure to agree on a formula by early july could doom the push to kill obamacare, which has been a republican vow since it became law in 2010. congress is already months behind in writing a budget blueprint that would guide federal spending in the fiscal year beginning oct. 1. republicans are deeply divided over the level of defense spending and potential structural reforms to social welfare programs such as social security, medicare and medicaid. if that is not enough, house republicans are promising to streamline the antiquated tax code and reduce rates. democrats and some experts outside of congress argue their approach would largely help the wealthy while ballooning the nation’s debt.

" mateusz morawiecki was sworn in as poland s new prime minister on monday and european council president donald tusk called on the new leader to pursue european unity. poland s ruling law and justice party (pis) is at odds with the eu over immigration, logging in an ancient forest and government attempts to control the courts and the media. critics say the eurosceptic party s policies have subverted democracy and the rule of law. at the same time, acrimony between tusk and the pis dates back years. poland, acting on orders from the pis boss and long time tusk adversary jaroslaw kaczynski, was the sole member of the 28 eu members to vote in march against tusk s re election. morawiecki, 49, replaced beata szydlo, who became a deputy prime minister. pis sacked the popular szydlo last week in a bid to improve poland s image abroad and prepare the conservatives for a series of elections. morawiecki will remain finance minister and economy minister. all other ministers have kept their jobs for now, although some ministerial changes are expected in weeks to come. morawiecki said his government will continue the work of szydlo. he is expected to outline his policies on tuesday. tusk, a former polish prime minister before pis came to power in 2015, said he counts on good cooperation.  acting for poland s strong position in the european union and for the unity of all member states is the need of the moment,  tusk wrote. former polish president lech walesa, who is a critic of the pis said on twitter:  the circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles.  walesa led protests and strikes that shook communist rule in the 1980s. szydlo s government was one of the most popular in poland since the 1989 collapse of communism. it registered around 40 percent approval due to low unemployment, increases in public spending and a focus on traditional catholic values in public life.

" dutch judges jailed a onetime aide to ethiopia s former communist ruler mengistu haile mariam for life on friday for war crimes carried out during ethiopia s  red terror  purges of the 1970s, including the execution of 75 prisoners. eshetu alemu, 63, was found guilty at his trial in the hague of ordering the 1978 killing of camp detainees   many of them under 18 years of age   who were taken from their cells and strangled with ropes in a church. in the hearings held under dutch universal jurisdiction, alemu, a former mengistu regional representative, was convicted of all charges brought by prosecutors, including arbitrary detention, inhumane treatment, torture and mass murder.  the fact that the majority of victims were children younger than 18 makes the crimes all the more cruel,  said presiding judge mariette renckens. alemu came to the netherlands as an asylum seeker in 1990 and had been in custody since 2015. he has pleaded not guilty to the charges but was not present when the verdict was read out. negus gebeyehu, a prisoner in a camp under alemu s control, gave an emotional speech in the hague court following the verdict as other victims cheered.  justice has been done for ethiopia,  he said.  i was imprisoned as a young man and i survived. this is also the day for us to forgive.  an ethiopian court had sentenced alemu to death in absentia in 2007 for his role in the  red terror , which mengistu s communist military junta conducted after ethiopian emperor, haile selassie, was ousted in 1974. mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in the same trial in 2007, where he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17 year rule.  today s verdict shows perpetrators that the netherlands will not be a safe haven,  jirko patist of the national prosecutor s office said. the netherlands is one of the european countries that has established an international crimes prosecution unit to prosecute alleged war criminals residing in the netherlands even if their crimes were committed abroad.

" u.s. representative steve scalise, the no. 3 republican in the house of representatives, showed further improvement days after being shot by a man who opened fire on lawmakers at a baseball practice earlier in the week, his lead surgeon said in a statement on saturday. scalise’s condition was upgraded to “serious,” from “critical” after undergoing another surgery on saturday, according to a statement from dr. jack sava, the director of trauma at the medstar washington hospital center. “he is more responsive and is speaking with his loved ones,” the doctor said. scalise, 51, sustained injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in his left hip early on wednesday at a baseball field in a suburb of washington. four men, including scalise, a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist, were shot and wounded when a man identified as james hodgkinson, opened fire on the lawmakers as they practiced for an annual charity baseball game between republicans and democrats. sava earlier said the louisiana congressman had been at “imminent risk of death” when he was first brought into the hospital on wednesday, and he received many units of transfused blood. hodgkinson 66, who was from the st. louis suburb of belleville, illinois, died after being shot by police.

" major governments, including the united states, the european union and canada, and top united nations  officials, are among those demanding the release of reuters reporters wa lone and kyaw soe oo from detention in myanmar.  the reporters were arrested on dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of yangon. they had worked on stories about a military crackdown in rakhine state, from where about 665,000 rohingya muslims have fled since august and sought refuge in bangladesh, according to the united nations. the two journalists were sent to yangon s insein prison on wednesday after a brief court appearance where they were allowed to meet their families and a lawyer for the first time since their arrest. myanmar s ministry of information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. it said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the british colonial era official secrets act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged.  reuters president and editor in chief stephen j. adler  has called for their immediate release.      wa lone and kyaw soe oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,  he said in a statement. here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups, journalists and press freedom advocates around the world:     a group of 50 pulitzer prize winners called their arrest  an outrageous attack on media freedom  and demanded their immediate release.  wa lone and kyaw soe oo are brave, principled and professional journalists who were working in the public interest and were jailed simply for doing their jobs,  they said in a statement on wednesday.   two u.n. human rights experts called on myanmar last week to release the two reporters, saying it was putting myanmar on a dangerous path by using the official secrets act to criminalize journalism.  journalism is not a crime. these detentions are another way for the government to censor information about the military s role in rakhine state and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place,  said yanghee lee and david kaye, who are the u.n. special rapporteur on myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively.   u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has said the united states was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  last week,  the state department reiterated the u.s. demand for the reporters  immediate release.   senator ben cardin, the leading democrat on the senate foreign relations committee called the arrests  outrageous .  it just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule,  he said.   republican thom tillis and democrat chris coons, leaders of the u.s. senate human rights caucus, said they were  gravely concerned  about the reporters  arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the rohingya.    japanese foreign minister taro kano said last week,  freedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. the japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.  tokyo based human rights now has called on japan to take a stronger stance.    the european union has urged myanmar to release the reporters  as quickly as possible.  a spokeswoman for eu  foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said,  freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.    u.n. secretary general antonio guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and press freedom in myanmar.    britain, holland, canada, norway and sweden have demanded the release of the reuters reporters. australia has expressed concern and bangladesh has denounced the arrests.    former new zealand prime minister helen clark said it was  disturbing  to hear of the detention of the two reuters journalists.  press freedom is very important,  she said in a tweet on christmas day.   vijay nambiar, former special adviser on myanmar to the u.n. secretary general, said in a statement to reuters that the detentions had caused  widespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of myanmar.    president of the european parliament antonio tajani called on myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters.   the new york times said in an editorial on saturday that releasing the two journalists immediately  would help restore at least some lost faith  in aung san suu kyi s government.   human rights watch said the detentions appeared to be  aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the rohingya.     the committee to protect journalists said the arrests were  having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance .   reporters without borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were  completely spurious .   advocacy group fortify rights demanded myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the reuters journalists.    myanmar s irrawaddy online news site called on dec. 14 for the journalists  release in an editorial headlined  the crackdown on the media must stop.  it said  it is an outrage to see the ministry of information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed   as police normally do to criminals   on its website soon after the detention. it is chilling to see that moi has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.    the southeast asian press alliance said the journalists were  only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the rohingya conflict.     the protection committee for myanmar journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .    the foreign correspondents  club of myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about press freedom in myanmar.    the foreign correspondents  club in thailand, foreign correspondents  association of the philippines, jakarta foreign correspondents  club and foreign correspondents  club of hong kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

" it is perhaps  only a matter of time  before rome is hit by a barcelona style attack but security forces are ready in case the vatican is targeted, the head the swiss guard has said. security has been stepped up at religious sites throughout italy, including at the vatican, since last year, when a truck driven by a suspected islamist militant killed 86 people in the french city of nice. barriers and police and army vehicles have been placed around st. peter s basilica to make it harder for a vehicle to gather speed in an attack such as the one last week in barcelona, which killed 13 people. despite threats from islamic state, rome and other italian cities have so far been spared the kind of vehicle attacks that have also hit nice, london, and berlin.  it could perhaps be just a matter of time before there is such an attack in rome, but we are prepared,  christoph graf, the commandant of the swiss guard, was quoted as telling the swiss catholic website cath.ch. graf, referring to the attack in barcelona, spoke on the sidelines of a religious ceremony in the swiss city of solothurn earlier this week. websites linked to islamic state militants have made threats against catholic targets in rome in recent years. in 2015 in a video showing the beheading of 21 egyptian coptic christians in libya, one of the killers said:  safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for ... we will conquer rome, by the will of allah.  at about the same time a website used by militants ran a photo montage showing the movement s black flag flying from the obelisk at the center of st peter s square. the swiss guard has its origins as a papal protection force in the 16th century and numbers about 110 men, all of swiss nationality. it shares responsibility for the protection of the pope and the vatican with a police force of about the same size. italian police are responsible for patrolling the vatican s external perimeter in rome. both vatican security forces are trained in anti terrorism tactics and in the use of modern weapons.

" donald trump’s company was pursuing a moscow real estate deal while he was running for u.s. president in late 2015 and early 2016, the washington post reported on sunday. the post report cited people familiar with the proposal and records viewed by trump organization lawyers. the newspaper said investors and trump’s company had signed a letter of intent to build a trump tower in moscow but the project, lacking land and permits, was abandoned at the end of january 2016, just before the u.s. presidential primaries began, according to several people familiar with the proposal. the white house initially referred reuters’ queries to white house special counsel ty cobb and later to the trump organization. neither responded immediately to a request for comment. the washington post report comes amid investigations by an independent special counsel and congressional committees into whether trump campaign aides colluded with moscow to influence the 2016 u.s. election. trump and the russian government have denied any collusion. in july 2016, trump denied business connections with russia and said on twitter: “for the record, i have zero investments in russia.” he told a news conference the next day: “i have nothing to do with russia.” discussions about the moscow project began in earnest in september 2015, the washington post said, citing people briefed on the deal. an unidentified investor planned to build the project and, under a licensing agreement, put trump’s name on it. however, it was unclear how involved or aware trump was of his company’s negotiations, the newspaper reported. before the project was dropped, a russian born real estate developer had urged trump to visit moscow to promote the proposal and suggested he could get russian president vladimir putin to say “great things” about trump, according to the report, which cited people briefed on the correspondence. trump, who was elected in november 2016, never went to moscow, the newspaper said. details about the proposed deal were contained in a batch of emails to be turned over to congressional investigators shortly, the report said.

" u.s. president donald trump said on monday that iran must immediately stop its financial and military support for “terrorists and militias” and he reiterated that it never be permitted to possess atomic arms. “most importantly, the united states and israel can declare with one voice that iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon   never, ever   and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias, and it must cease immediately,” trump said in public remarks at a meeting in jerusalem with israeli president reuven rivlin. the united states brands iran a “state sponsor of terrorism”. it says tehran’s support for syrian president bashar al assad in syria’s civil war, houthi rebels in yemen’s civil war and the hezbollah shi’ite political party and militia in lebanon have helped destabilize the middle east.  trump flew to israel from riyadh earlier in the day, on the second leg of his first overseas trip since entering office in january. in his speech at rivlin’s official residence, trump said he was deeply encouraged by his conversations with muslim world leaders in saudi arabia. “many expressed their resolve to help end terrorism and the spread of radicalization. many muslim nations have already taken steps to begin following through on this commitment,” he said.   “there is a growing realization among your arab neighbors that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by iran,” trump told rivlin.

" president muhammadu buhari is to visit southeast nigeria this week, his spokesman said on monday, his first trip since taking office to a region formerly known as biafra.  calls for secession have become increasingly loud in the last few months in parts of the southeast, where the president is deeply unpopular, prompting buhari to say he will not allow nigeria to be divided by separatist groups. a million people died in a 1967 70 civil war over the short lived republic of biafra. buhari, a 74 year old former military ruler who took office in may 2015, fought in the war as a young soldier on the government side. the spokesman, garba shehu, said the president would, as part of his trip, visit the campaign run by his all progressive congress party in the state of anambra ahead of gubernatorial elections in the next few days.   mr president will be visiting two southeast states of ebonyi and anambra,  said shehu. he said buhari would leave the capital, abuja, on tuesday morning and return the following day.  tensions in the region rose following the release on bail of nnamdi kanu, leader of the region s best known secessionist group, the indigenous people of biafra (ipob). the government designated the group as a terrorist organization in september, and deployed troops to the region to crack down on secessionists.  kanu, who was on bail after being charged with treason, has not been seen since sept. 14, when ipob says his home was raided by soldiers. the military has denied raiding kanu s home and has said it is not holding him.  we are yet to know our leader s whereabouts or that of his parents. (buhari) is not the type of person any governor should be welcoming to their land,  said an ipob spokesman in a statement that urged the president to  stay away .  a nigerian minister in september said secessionists in the southeast were sponsored by the government s political opponents. the government has repeatedly rejected the accusation that buhari, a muslim northerner, is opposed to the development of the mostly christian southeast, where people are mainly from the igbo ethnic group.  nigeria s 180 million inhabitants are split roughly equally between christians and muslims, and around 250 ethnic groups mostly live peacefully side by side.

" pro marijuana activists planning to light thousands of joints at donald trump’s presidential inauguration in a call for national legalization of the drug fear a reversal of recent gains if his attorney general pick is confirmed in hearings beginning on tuesday. trump’s nominee, u.s. senator jeff sessions of alabama, has long condemned use of the drug, which has been legalized for recreational use in eight u.s. states and the district of columbia but remains banned by federal law. sessions has opposed attempts to legalize marijuana and reduce drug sentences longtime washington pro marijuana activist adam eidinger, one of the organizers of the plan to distribute and light 4,200 joints during the jan. 20 inauguration, said on monday that protesters wearing t shirts saying: “great americans smoke marijuana” would be in line for sessions’ hearing before dawn. “this is political warfare. there is no respect in washington for the marijuana movement or its business interest right now,” eidinger said in a telephone interview. the demonstration will be among dozens of protests planned  against trump, a republican real estate developer whose campaign promises included building a wall on the mexican border and deporting millions of illegal immigrants. trump’s transition team did not reply to a request for comment. eidinger said he and other activists and entrepreneurs  feared sessions could erase gains for legal marijuana across the united states. “i don’t want to go to jail. this a real thing for a lot of people,” he said. members of his group plan to light the joints at four minutes and 20 seconds into trump’s inaugural speech if he has not backed the idea of national legalization. the date of april 20, or 4/20, corresponds with the figure widely recognized within the cannabis subculture as a symbol for all things marijuana. trump said during the election campaign that marijuana legalization was best left to the states. fbi figures show there were about 640,000 marijuana related arrests in 2015. in addition to the states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, 28 states have legalized use for medical purposes.  taylor west, the deputy director of the national cannabis industry association, a trade group, said legal marijuana sales totaled nearly $7 billion last year, a figure projected to reach $20 billion in 2021. “we are certainly watching the situation very closely,” she said of the incoming administration.

" the texas court of criminal appeals on wednesday dismissed an abuse of power indictment against rick perry, ending a case that dragged on the former texas governor’s unsuccessful bid for the 2016 republican presidential nomination. perry, who campaigned for the nomination in 2012 and 2016, faced a first degree felony charge in state courts that could have brought up to 99 years in prison because of a funding veto he made in 2013 seen as being intended to force a texas county district attorney to resign. “when the only act that is being prosecuted is a veto, then the prosecution itself violates separation of powers,” the court said. the longest serving governor in texas history, perry, 65, was indicted on the two charges in august 2014 by a grand jury in travis county, a democratic stronghold in the heavily republican state. “the court’s decision today proves that this indictment was nothing less than a baseless political attack,” perry told a news conference. “i have always known that the actions that i took were not only lawful and legal   they were right.” he first threatened and then vetoed $7.5 million for an integrity unit in the travis county district attorney’s office. many said perry played hardball politics to force out county district attorney rosemary lehmberg, a democrat, after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving. in july 2015, a texas state appeals court threw out a lesser charge against perry for coercion of a public official, leaving only the abuse of power charge. lawyers for perry, whose term ended at the start of 2015, have argued the governor was acting within his powers when he made the funding cut.  a prosecutor in the case said that perry acted unlawfully to pressure lehmberg by threatening the funding cut. lehmberg remained in office. in september 2015, perry, struggling to raise money and languishing near the bottom in presidential opinion polls, became the first member of the crowded republican field to drop out of the 2016 white house race. on the campaign trail, perry tried to rally support among republican voters by saying the indictment was the result of a partisan attack by democrats. analysts noted, however, the threat of a trial during his campaign likely scared away major donors, dooming a campaign seen as a long shot.  perry dropped out of a gaffe filled campaign for the 2012 republican presidential nomination.

" the u.s. house of representatives is expected to pass a $6.3 billion piece of legislation on wednesday designed to spur medical innovation, speed access to new drugs, expand mental health treatment, and combat opioid abuse. the bill, known as the 21st century cures act, provides $4.8 billion to the national institutes of health (nih) over 10 years to support brain, cancer and precision medicine research. it also provides $500 million to the food and drug administration to approve drugs and devices more quickly. president elect donald trump has promised to cut “red tape” at the fda. he has not commented specifically on 21st century cures. the u.s. senate is expected to vote on the bill next week. it is expected to pass, though possibly not before some additional changes are made. it would then go to president barack obama for signature. the bill calls for $1 billion over two years to treat and prevent opioid abuse, including improving prescription drug monitoring programs, training for health care providers, and expanding access to opioid treatment programs. critics of the bill, including senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts, a democrat, said it contains too many give aways to the pharmaceutical industry and will allow companies to push treatments with limited proof of efficacy. speaking on the senate floor on monday, warren said she could not vote for the bill despite its many positive elements and would not be a “lackey” for the drug industry. warren, along with republican senator charles grassley of iowa, also objects to a provision that would allow companies to hide payments to doctors under the auspices of continuing medical education. grassley co authored the sunshine act which led to the creation of a database listing drug and device company payments to doctors. “a lot of earlier payments to doctors were under the umbrella of continuing medical education,” grassley said in a statement on monday. “we shouldn’t create a loophole that would let drug and medical device companies mask their payments to doctors under a payment category that’s too broad and could gut the spirit and the letter of the sunshine act.” the bill would add an additional reporting exemption for physicians who receive indirect payments for speaking fees. patients groups hailed the bill, saying it would bring patient voices to the center of the drug approval process. “this is a patient centered bill,” said ellen sigal, chair and founder of friends of cancer research, a patient advocacy organization. “it fosters innovation and doesn’t lower safety standards.” ",0
" eu envoys discussed on wednesday delaying into next year the launch of talks with london on a post brexit relationship, raising the risk of businesses shifting out of britain due to lack of clarity on what will happen after march 2019. a meeting of ambassadors from the other 27 eu states had been due to start discussing how to negotiate a transition that would start when britain quits the bloc in 17 months. but instead, people familiar with the talks told reuters, the discussion was dominated by concern that london would fail to meet eu conditions next month for opening future negotiations. once again, lead powers germany and france insisted british prime minister theresa may agree in principle to pay an exit bill in the tens of billions of euros to brussels before eu leaders agree to open a second phase of brexit negotiations on the future relationship. they told may at a summit last month that they were ready to do that when they next meet, on dec. 14. but british negotiators, who will be in brussels on thursday and friday for more talks on that financial settlement, as well as rights for eu citizens and the irish border,  should not think they are sailing ahead into the next phase , an eu official familiar with the envoys  discussions said.  while the transition and future relationship were formally on the agenda, what ambassadors focused very much on was real concern that the uk does not realize that the eu27 are deadly serious about the need to meet the  sufficient progress  mark on the three first phase issues.  with may struggling with the loss of a second scandal hit cabinet minister in a week, germany, france and others are ramping up pressure on her to cut a deal in the knowledge that businesses are piling on their own demands for clarity before making investment decisions in the new year.  the focus was very much on the here and now and the fact that the uk is so far away from meeting the sufficient progress point and that we are rapidly running out of time,  the official added. several diplomats gave similar accounts of the meeting.   we should not be pressured or rushed. they really must come with the money,  one senior eu diplomat said.      the european parliament, which must approve any withdrawal treaty, added its voice on wednesday. its brexit coordinator, guy verhofstadt said may s suggestion that agreement was close on citizens  rights was wide of the mark and that  major issues  remained unresolved to guarantee rights for eu nationals. the eu official said the ambassadors agreed that without  sufficient progress  on divorce issues in the next month, the talks would simply be extended into 2018 with no discussions on the future   talks that london is keen to start immediately.  if they don t move until early december, we ll have to think again what to do next,  the senior diplomat said.  then there could be a take it or leave it offer from us, which would clearly not be very nice to britain and at home they would fall under immense pressure to walk away from the talks.  some brexit backers in her own government have urged may to walk out without a withdrawal deal, arguing that the eu also has an interest in an orderly split and that the british economy can stand any disruption   a view not shared by many businesses. several eu officials said britain would have to abide by all eu laws in the transition period, even if they are changed during that time, but would have no vote on them. and that such a transition, which both sides have said should last less than two years, might have to be extended to give time for a trade pact.  it s impossible to get any bespoke trade deal in two years or so,  said an eu parliament official who deals with brexit.  and for all that time the uk would be an eu colony   forced to accept all our laws with no say.  this is what i call a definition of colony.

" a group of democrats in congress urged the u.s. department of justice and federal trade commission in a letter this week to conduct a more in depth review of online retailer amazon.com inc’s plan to buy grocer whole foods market inc.  the lawmakers asked that the review include consideration of what effect the $13.7 billion deal could have on access to healthy foods in so called food deserts where residents may have limited access to fresh groceries.  “while we do not oppose the merger at this time, we are concerned about what this merger could mean for african american communities across the country already suffering from a lack of affordable healthy food choices from grocers,” the letter said on thursday. the letter was signed by u.s. representative marcia fudge and 11 other democrats, including senator cory booker.  amazon and whole foods hope to expand access to fresh food, said brian huseman, amazon’s vice president of policy, in a letter to fudge, also on thursday.  “we agree with you that access to food is an important issue for the country, and we share your goal of improving that access,” huseman said in the letter. amazon has lobbied to be able to accept food stamps online and is participating in a pilot program. “we deliver low cost, healthy food to zip codes across the country that before amazon had limited access to a large selection of high quality foods,” huseman wrote to fudge. fudge’s letter was made public by the united food and commercial workers union (ufcw), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in the united states. fudge’s office confirmed she had sent the letter. amazon’s plan announced in june to buy premium grocer whole foods roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and hurt employment.  still, most antitrust experts expect the federal trade commission to approve the planned merger. the letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the ufcw union. “political concerns about amazon’s acquisition of whole foods are growing for good reason,” ufcw president marc perrone said on friday. “amazon’s monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard working men and women at whole foods, it’s also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.”  amazon has sought to dispute that it would monopolize the grocery industry. wal mart stores inc currently controls the largest market share.  “we also do not plan job reductions as part of the acquisition, which if approved would result in a company with a combined less than 3 percent of national grocery sales,” huseman wrote.

" u.s. president barack obama, keen to preserve his legacy on domestic health care and the iran nuclear deal, is not expected to make major moves on israeli palestinian peace before leaving office, u.s. officials said on thursday. one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the last word on the president’s failed peace effort might come from secretary of state john kerry at an appearance on sunday at an annual middle east conference in washington. obama’s aides are wary of being seen picking a fight with donald trump at a time when he hopes to persuade the republican president elect to preserve parts of his legacy, including the iran nuclear deal, obamacare and the opening to cuba. while obama has yet to present his final decision, several officials said he had given no sign that he intended to go against the consensus of his top advisers, who have mostly urged him not to take dramatic steps, a second official said.  “there is no evidence that there is any muscle behind (doing) anything,” said a third official. putting new pressure on israel could be seen as a vindictive parting shot by obama at israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, the first official said, noting they have had a testy relationship. there is concern that trump, in response, might over react in trying to demonstrate his own pro israel credentials, for example by moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv, a step that would enrage palestinians and create an international furor. officials said obama has weighed enshrining his own outline for a deal in a u.n. security council resolution that would live on after he gives way to trump on jan. 20. another idea was to give a speech laying out such parameters. these options appear to have lost steam. kerry, who led the last round of peace talks that collapsed in 2014, appears on sunday at the saban forum conference of u.s., israeli and arab officials. officials could not rule out that obama might also talk about israeli palestinian diplomacy before he leaves office. the white house and the israeli embassy declined comment. the central issues to be resolved in the conflict include borders between israel and a future palestinian state, the fate of jewish settlements in the west bank, which most nations regard as illegal, the fate of palestinian refugees and the status of jerusalem. israeli officials remain concerned that obama and his aides have not explicitly ruled out some kind of last ditch u.s. action, either at the united nations or in another public forum.     u.s. officials said obama could also have his hand forced, notably if another nation like france put forward a u.n. security council resolution condemning israeli settlement activity as illegal or illegitimate, daring washington to veto it as it did a similar french proposed resolution in 2011. u.s. ambassador to israel dan shapiro, asked if washington would again veto a french proposal, told israel’s army radio: “we will always oppose unilateral proposals.” he added: “if there is something more balanced, i cannot guess what the response will be.” ",0
" actor and director george clooney, a supporter of hillary clinton’s presidential bid, broke ranks over campaign financing on saturday to condemn the “obscene” sums of money in u.s. politics and praised clinton’s chief political rival in the process.    clooney made the remarks in an interview with nbc news’ “meet the press” the day after he and his wife, amal, hosted a fundraiser on democratic party hopeful clinton’s behalf friday night with a price tag of up to $353,400 per couple.  “we had some protesters last night when we pulled up in san francisco and they’re right to protest. they’re absolutely right. it is an obscene amount of money,” clooney said in excerpts released on saturday. the interview will air on sunday. bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont and clinton’s rival in the race for the democratic nomination to run for the white house in the nov. 8 election, has pounced on former secretary of state clinton over the big ticket event and for accepting large sums of money for her campaign. “the sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. it’s ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. i agree completely,” clooney said.  in response to the dinner, the sanders campaign on friday evening sent out an email to supporters asking them to help reach their fundraising goals by chipping in $3.53 apiece, instead.

" palestinian billionaire sabih al masri, jordan s most powerful businessman, returned to amman on tuesday after his release in saudi arabia secured when he agreed to pay an unspecified amount of money, sources close to the matter said.  masri was detained for questioning last week over his alleged links with saudi business partners among royals, ministers and officials who were rounded up last month in an unprecedented anti corruption purge. masri, chairman of amman based arab bank, jordan s largest lender, was taken into custody just before he was planning to leave saudi arabia after chairing meetings of saudi companies he owns, informed sources said.   he is at his home now in amman,  said a family source. masri later held meetings in the bank with senior officials. arab bank shares, which account for almost a quarter of the $24 billion market capitalization of the amman exchange, ended  1.48 percent higher as investors reacted favorably to the news of his return. masri has since taking the helm at arab bank in 2012 helped boost confidence in one of the arab world s largest private financial institutions.  the bank, first established in jerusalem in 1930 and one of the major middle east financial institutions, has a balance sheet of more than $45 billion and has earned a reputation of resilience in the face of regional political turmoil. masri, a saudi citizen, said from his home in riyadh on sunday after his release that the saudi authorities had accorded him  all respect . [l8n1oh05j] saudi officials have not commented on his detention. jordanian authorities privately said king abdullah intervened to secure his release. a source familiar with the matter said masri was freed after reaching a settlement to return an unspecified amount of money. there was no comment from the masri family.  there is no way masri has been freed without agreeing to some settlement. the saudis are telling anyone who has made huge sums of money that they have to pay back some of that wealth,  the source said. another source said riyadh saw these settlements not as blackmail but an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world s top oil producer over several decades. saudi authorities have already succeeded in reaching financial settlements with dozens of royal family members, senior officials and wealthy businessmen in the crackdown spearheaded by powerful crown prince mohammad bin salman. around 200 people in total have been questioned in the crackdown, authorities said last month. saudi authorities estimate they could eventually recover around $100 billion of illicitly held funds. they have been working on reaching agreements with suspects detained at riyadh s luxurious ritz carlton hotel, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom. masri s detention unnerved business circles in jordan and the palestinian territories as well as many arab magnates across the middle east who have made fortunes in saudi arabia, according to several investors who asked not to be named. his multi billion dollar investments in hotels and banking in jordan represent a cornerstone of the economy of the kingdom and he is by far the biggest investor in palestinian areas. a member of a prominent merchant family from nablus in the israeli occupied west bank, masri amassed a fortune by joining with influential saudi royals in a catering business to supply troops during the u.s. led military operation to retake kuwait from iraq in the 1991 gulf war. confidants said masri had been warned not to travel to the saudi capital after mass arrests of saudi royals, ministers and businessmen in early november. officials and businessmen had warned of the reverberations of the crisis on an aid strapped jordanian economy already plagued by high debts. saudi arabia is a major donor.

" president barack obama and the deputy crown prince of saudi arabia on friday discussed ways to support iraqis in their fight against islamic state militants and the importance of a political transition in war torn syria, the white house said. obama met with mohammed bin salman in the oval office for about an hour. the deputy crown prince is visiting the united states to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as vision 2030, to slash the kingdom’s dependence on oil exports. “the president expressed appreciation for saudi arabia’s contributions to the campaign against isil,” the white house said, using an acronym for the islamic state group.  the two talked about steps to support iraqis “including increased gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,” the white house said.  u.s. officials have expressed unease about the saudi led campaign against houthi rebels in yemen, which according to the united nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. saudi arabia is worried about closer relations between the united states and iran, riyadh’s arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.   obama welcomed saudi arabia’s commitment to a political settlement of the yemen conflict and support by the gulf cooperation council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the white house said.  on syria, obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from president bashar al assad, the white house said. the united states is working with international partners on what it calls a syrian led transition process facilitated by the united nations, but so far there has been little progress.  over 50 diplomats at the u.s. state department signed a memo, leaked on thursday, that was critical of the obama administration’s syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against assad’s government.  asked about the memo, saudi arabia’s foreign minister adel al jubeir, also in washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a “more robust intervention” including airstrikes, a no fly zone, and a no drive zone, from the beginning of the five year civil war.  obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in syria, white house spokeswoman jen friedman said.  both washington and riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a u.s. report into the sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some u.s. lawmakers have alleged link saudi government officials to the attacks. jubeir said investigations show that the allegations “are not correct and they don’t hold.”  ",0
" a defiant president donald trump has pledged to appeal to the u.s. supreme court if necessary to fight for his revised travel ban, parts of which were halted by two different federal judges in recent days.  the legal path forward will be challenging, though, as lawsuits work their way through federal courts on opposite sides of the country, in hawaii and maryland. on thursday, a federal judge in washington state said he was also weighing a temporary restraining order. the justice department’s first step would likely be filing an appeal in either or both of the cases it lost this week, an action likely to come within days. justice department spokeswoman sarah isgur flores declined to comment on the administration’s intentions. in granting a temporary restraining order against the ban challenged in a lawsuit brought by the state of hawaii, u.s. district judge derrick watson found on wednesday that “a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.” trump’s executive order would temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly muslim countries. the president has said the ban is needed for national security.  early on thursday, u.s. district judge theodore chuang issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in a case in maryland brought by refugee resettlement agencies represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center. chuang ruled that the groups were likely to succeed in showing that the travel ban portion of the executive order was intended to be a ban on muslims, and as a result, violates the u.s. constitution’s religious freedom guarantee. he did not enjoin the refugee portion of the ban.  “to avoid sowing seeds of division in our nation, upholding this fundamental constitutional principle at the core of our nation’s identity plainly serves a significant public interest,” chuang wrote in his ruling. the court orders, while victories for the plaintiffs, are only an early step in litigation and the government could ultimately win its underlying case. watson and chuang were appointed to the bench by former democratic president barack obama.  trump, speaking after the hawaii ruling at a rally in nashville on wednesday, called his revised executive order a “watered down version” of his first. the president said he would take the case “as far as it needs to go,” including to the supreme court, in order to get a ruling that the ban is legal. the trump administration won a small legal victory later on thursday. u.s. district judge james robart in seattle, who last month blocked trump’s first travel ban, ruled that the second travel ban was different enough from the first that he would not simply apply a preliminary injunction he issued against the first ban to the second one. he said he was weighing a request for a temporary restraining order on the new travel ban. the likely next stops if the administration decides to contest the two rulings that it lost this week would be the 4th and 9th u.s. circuit courts of appeal. both may be frosty venues for trump’s arguments, with majorities of the judges in each appointed by democratic presidents.  three judges on the 9th circuit upheld robart’s order last month on the first travel ban. rather than appeal further, the administration withdrew the ban, promising to retool it in ways that would address the legal issues. the supreme court is currently split between four conservative and four liberal justices, with no ninth justice since the death of antonin scalia more than a year ago. trump’s nominee to fill the vacant supreme court seat, neil gorsuch, a 49 year old conservative, is likely to be asked about the travel ban next week when he goes before the senate judiciary committee for a confirmation hearing.  republicans are hoping that the senate votes to confirm gorsuch for the court by mid april, which would likely be too late for him to weigh in on an emergency appeal about the travel ban. trump signed the new ban on march 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with his january executive order, which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before robart stopped its enforcement in february. watson’s order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. he set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended.

" a special federal judicial panel ruled for the second time in two months on thursday that the republican led texas legislature deliberately redrew political boundaries so as to unfairly diminish voter clout of the state’s growing latino population. a divided three judge panel found that the boundaries of several state legislative districts were reshaped with the intention of illegally diluting the strength of the democratic leaning hispanic electorate for the benefit of the republican party. the panel ruled that the redrawn boundaries were designed to either fragment cohesive latino communities among multiple districts, or to lump hispanics into a single jurisdiction and thus limit their overall sway. similar gerrymandering tactics of “cracking” and “packing” were found last month by the same panel in redrawn boundaries for three of the state’s 36 congressional districts. it was not immediately clear whether texas would appeal the latest decision, which pertained to state legislative districts encompassing some of the state’s largest cities, including dallas, san antonio and houston. as in last month’s 2 1 decision, thursday’s ruling was agreed upon by u.s. district judges xavier rodriguez and orlando garcia of san antonio, appointees of former republican president george w. bush and former democratic president bill clinton, respectively.  the third member of the panel, 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals judge jerry smith, appointed by former republican president ronald reagan, dissented in both opinions.  he blasted the latest decision as “clearly erroneous,” writing that partisan advantage, not race itself, was the rationale for drawing the districts as they were.  generally courts have ruled that shaping districts based on race or ethnicity is illegal, but drawing boundaries to gain political advantage for the majority party is not.  texas democratic party chair gilberto hinojosa welcomed the findings of thursday’s 153 page majority opinion. “the republicans have dealt texas a deep moral wound,” he said. “they haven’t just been cheating to gain an edge in the political game. they have been deliberately holding back texans from having a voice in their own government.” republicans have dominated all statewide non judicial offices in texas for more than 20 years, and have frequently used that advantage to redraw political maps to benefit their  party.

" the u.s. department of justice on friday called for the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging president donald trump violated the constitution by accepting foreign payments at his hotels. the lawsuit, filed in january, said trump violates the constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day to day control to his sons. in a filing in manhattan federal court on friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case   an ethics non profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker   do not have legal standing to sue.  the government also said payments to trump’s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president. “plaintiffs’ broad brush claims effectively assert that the constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses,” the department said in its court filing. a spokesman for ethics watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, one of the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the lawsuit said businesses such as hotel bookers are injured when foreign governments try to “curry favor” with trump by favoring his own enterprises. it said this had even occurred since trump took office, when china granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the “one china” policy of his white house predecessors. the doj on friday said any payments to trump’s restaurants in new york, a city with 24,000 restaurants, have not caused enough specific harm to plaintiffs to give them the ability to sue.   u.s. district judge ronnie abrams, an appointee of former democratic president barack obama, oversees the litigation.

" u.s. democratic lawmakers called on wednesday for a congressional committee to issue subpoenas to the white house and three companies for documents about fired national security adviser michael flynn.     in a letter to trey gowdy, the republican chairman of the house government reform committee, the panel’s democratic members said the committee should demand documents the white house has refused to hand over despite a bipartisan request in march. some of the documents are related to work on a proposal to build nuclear reactors in the middle east with the involvement of russian firms.     three companies   flynn’s consultancy and two companies he advised on the nuclear project — have not produced documents and communications the committee’s minority members requested on september 15, and should be compelled to cooperate, the democratic members said. flynn, a former national security adviser under president donald trump, is a central figure in a federal probe led by special counsel robert mueller into whether trump aides colluded with russia to boost his presidential campaign. russia has denied interfering in the u.s. election and trump has said there was no collusion. in response to the democrats’ request on wednesday, gowdy referred the matter to mueller and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, saying those kinds of allegations against flynn should be handled by the justice department. “much of what is sought by my democratic colleagues   if properly investigated, charged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt   would carry criminal penalties. congress does not, and cannot, prosecute crimes,” gowdy said in the letter. flynn’s lawyer, robert kelner, declined to comment.     the committee has been probing whether flynn fully disclosed payments from foreign sources and overseas trips when he renewed his top secret security clearance last year.     one focus of the probe is a june 2015 trip flynn, a former  general, took to israel and egypt to gauge interest in a plan floated by a group of scientists, consultants, and former military officers to build and provide security for dozens of nuclear power plants in the middle east. a promotional slide indicates that rosoboron, a russian state owned arms exporter that is under u.s. sanctions, was to be part of the multi billion dollar project.     trump fired flynn in february after a top justice department official warned that the former defense intelligence agency director could be blackmailed because moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with russian officials. in the letter, democratic lawmakers argued that subpoenas were needed to determine whether flynn was promoting the project while he was in the white house.      “we believe the paper trail must be pursued to answer the gravest question of all   did general flynn seek to change the course of our country’s national security to benefit the same private interests he previously promoted,” the letter said. the democrats also pointed to a discrepancy between flynn’s financial disclosures and statements to the committee by the counsel for ironbridge group, inc. and ip3 corp., two companies set up by former navy rear admiral michael hewitt and which are promoting one of two competing plans by u.s. based consortiums for building nuclear reactors in the middle east.     in an amended disclosure in august, flynn said he served as an advisor to ironbridge from june 2016 to december 2016, a period that overlapped with his work on trump’s presidential campaign and the post election transition.     in contrast, the counsel for ip3 and ironbridge told the committee that the company tried to hire flynn, but he never accepted the offer. the counsel said ip3 and ironbridge had split with members of another company — acu strategic partners — and does not involve russian entities in its nuclear plan. a spokesperson for ip3 declined to comment. acu, which is promoting a plan that envisions the participation of government and private sector entities from russia, ukraine and israel, among other countries, did not respond to a request for comment.

" a bill passed by u.s. house republicans would cause 23 million people to lose healthcare coverage by 2026 while de stabilizing health insurance markets in some states and making it hard for sick people to buy insurance, a budget watchdog agency said on wednesday. the congressional budget office, a non partisan group of experts who analyze u.s. legislation, said the bill would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026. the report could give added ammunition to democrats who have accused president donald trump and congressional republicans of putting sick and low income people at risk with their effort to roll back former president barack obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law, formally known as the affordable care act but often called obamacare. the report also complicates the job of senate republicans   some of whom already have doubts about the house bill   as they craft their own healthcare legislation. republicans have sought to unravel obamacare since its passage and trump promised on the campaign trail to repeal it, saying it is too costly and an overreach by government in the healthcare market. as trump and republican leaders sought to bring wavering lawmakers on board with the house bill, they added a controversial last minute amendment that would give states leeway to drop an obamacare requirement that forces insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same insurance rates. another change would allow states to decide whether to require insurers to cover health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs that are mandatory under current law. but the cbo report said the amendment would make it difficult or impossible for people in poor health to purchase comprehensive coverage in some states. “people who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all,” the cbo report said. the cbo said markets for people to buy individual insurance plans could then become “unstable” in states that choose to waive the obamacare requirements for coverage of pre existing medical conditions and essential health benefits. even before the report, many republican senators were wary of the house version of the healthcare bill, saying it unraveled obamacare too much and too quickly. about 20 million people gained insurance under obamacare. the house bill would eliminate most obamacare taxes that help subsidize private health coverage for individuals, roll back the government’s medicaid health plan for the poor and disabled and replace the law’s income based tax credits for buying medical coverage with credits based on age. a group of 13 republican senators led by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is expected to draft its own version of the healthcare bill in the coming months. mcconnell, however, told reuters on wednesday he does not yet know how republicans will get the necessary votes. “this is a very challenging undertaking,” mcconnell said.    after the release of the cbo report, several republican senators said they could not support the house bill. “while i am in favor of repealing obamacare, i am opposed to the american health care act in its current form,” republican senator dean heller said in a statement. republican senator susan collins said too many people would lose insurance and that older and low income americans would be hurt. house republicans, who argue their healthcare bill would allow insurance markets to function more efficiently, focused on the projected budget savings from it and a finding in the cbo report that said insurance premiums for some people would decline. groups representing hospitals, insurers and doctors who opposed the house bill said the cbo report showed the senate should start fresh with an eye to maintaining coverage and benefits. democrats also blasted the bill and said the cbo report proved it would be catastrophic for millions of people who would lose health insurance. “the report makes clear trumpcare would be a cancer on the american healthcare system,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer said at a news conference. the new cbo score predicts the ahca would cover 1 million more americans than republicans’ previous version of the bill, which the agency estimated would have left 24 million more people uninsured than obamacare in 2026. to allay concerns about coverage of people with pre existing illnesses, house republicans allocated an additional $8 billion over five years in their bill to help sick people pay for insurance premiums but the cbo said the money would not be enough to help them afford coverage. the cbo said premiums would fall for younger people and rise for older people in states that did not waive obamacare requirements for an overall decline of about 4 percent. in states that made moderate changes to their markets, representing about one third of the u.s. population, premiums would fall 20 percent on average. reaction on wall street was muted, with shares of hospitals affected by the cuts to medicaid, like community health systems, and health insurers specializing in medicaid, such as molina healthcare (moh.n) and centene corp (cnc.n) unchanged in light after hours

" the u.s. senate voted on thursday to bolster travel security in the wake of the brussels attacks with measures that include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb sniffing dogs at domestic airports and other transit hubs. lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to add security measures to a separate bill that calls for renewing the programs of the federal aviation administration through september 2017. the faa bill is expected to come up for a final vote later this month.    after republicans and democrats reached a deal on security measures earlier in the day, lawmakers voted to raise the number of visible intermodal prevention response, or viper, teams within the transportation security administration from 31 to 60. viper teams, which are intended as a visible deterrent to attacks, can be deployed at airports and train or bus stations. other measures would bolster the vetting of airport employees, add security to vulnerable check in and baggage claim areas and authorize the tsa to donate security equipment to foreign airports with direct flights to the united states. the approved provisions would also order a new u.s. assessment of foreign cargo security programs and provide grant money to train state, local and foreign authorities in how to respond to mass casualty and “active shooter” incidents. it is unclear what kind of reception the faa bill, if passed by the senate, might receive in the house of representatives. house lawmakers have been considering their own faa legislation. that bill also calls for the privatization of the u.s. air traffic control system, a measure that is not in the senate’s legislation.

" urged on by u.s. president elect donald trump, republican lawmakers rushing to scrap obamacare said this week they hoped to make some changes intended to stabilize the insurance market while they work at repealing and replacing the law. the beginnings of a framework outlining what a post obamacare world could look like came in the same week that  congress approved a resolution instructing key committees of both the house of representatives and the senate to draft obamacare repeal legislation by a target date of jan. 27. the fate of the affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare, is a high stakes political showdown between republicans and democrats that potentially jeopardizes medical coverage for millions of americans and risks causing chaos in the health insurance marketplace. the seven year old law has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured americans to obtain health coverage and helped slow the rise in healthcare spending. but republicans have called it federal government overreach. “if our general goal is to move decisions out of washington back to the states, we should be able to make those decisions in the next several months,” a key republican senator working on the repeal, lamar alexander, told reporters outside the senate this week. in a speech on the senate floor, alexander indicated republicans are eyeing some moves insurers have said would help shore up the insurance plans offered on the obamacare exchanges. the changes could be done by law or by regulation, alexander said. alexander said he favors continuing, at least temporarily, the cost sharing subsidies that millions of americans receive with their obamacare exchange based plans   a kind of financial assistance that helps keep down the cost of deductibles and co pays. he advocates adjusting the special enrollment periods that insurers say are sometimes abused by people who wait until they are sick to sign up for insurance. insurers have long sought changes that would fix this facet of obamacare to weed out misuse. it would also help the transition to a new system, alexander said, if individuals could use government premium subsidies to buy plans outside of the obamacare marketplace. alexander is chairman of the senate health committee, one of the committees drafting the repeal legislation. he told reporters he had discussed his ideas with a number of senators and the process was evolving, but stressed it should be gradual, with some changes made by lawmakers and some by the secretary of health and human services after he is confirmed.  trump has nominated republican representative tom price for the job. “certainty is something the insurance industry needs so they don’t abandon coverage,” said senator johnny isakson of georgia, another republican lawmaker who has been working on how to stabilize  insurance markets. it was unclear whether lawmakers will reach the ambitious target date of jan. 27 for drafting repeal legislation. but house speaker paul ryan said on cnn on thursday that republicans are moving “as quickly as they can”. the 2010 law, democratic president barack obama’s signature piece of domestic policy, touches almost all parts of the u.s. healthcare system, making its replacement likely to take effect over a number of years, even if lawmakers are trying to draft changes in weeks or months.

" more republicans now think democrat hillary clinton, rather than donald trump, will win the presidency, as their party’s candidate struggles with difficulties including allegations of sexual misconduct and his suggestion he may not honor the outcome of the election. a reuters/ipsos poll released on wednesday and conducted from oct. 20 to oct. 24 found that 41 percent of republicans expected clinton to win the nov. 8 election, versus 40 percent who picked trump. that reflected a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of republicans said they thought their party’s nominee would win, versus 23 percent who expected clinton to prevail.  among trump’s supporters, 49 percent in the latest poll said they believed trump would win, down from 67 percent who felt that way at the beginning of the month. “there’s still hope, i guess. i just don’t have a great deal of faith in a good portion of the american public,” said bert horsley, 38, of belgrade, montana, who said he planned to vote for trump even though he believed clinton would win.  horsley said he felt the country was leaning increasingly socialist and that voters were more inclined to focus on trump’s problems than on issues facing clinton, including allegations she mishandled classified emails while secretary of state. “the nation’s willing to overlook certain things in some people and not in others,” he said. despite the growing pessimism, trump, who trails clinton in national opinion polls, still enjoys overwhelming support from members of his party. some 79 percent of likely republican voters said they would vote for him. many said their support was rooted in an expectation he would promote a conservative agenda in congress and appoint conservative justices to the supreme court.     democrats appear to be strongly anticipating a clinton presidency. some 83 percent of democrats said in the poll they thought she would win, while only 8 percent predicted trump would become president. among clinton’s supporters, 92 percent expected her to win, up from 83 percent a month earlier. clinton held a commanding lead in the race to win the electoral college and claim the presidency, according to results from the reuters/ipsos states of the nation project released on saturday. trump, a businessman and former reality television star, has alarmed mainstream republicans throughout his campaign by routinely bashing the political establishment and making a series of provocative statements.  he aroused criticism for belittling the parents of a u.s. soldier killed in the iraq war, calling for a ban on admitting muslims to the country and accusing a judge of bias because of his hispanic heritage. he has also asserted, without showing evidence, that the u.s. electoral system is rigged. but republicans remained mostly confident in their candidate’s chances until this month, when a videotape from 2005 was released in which trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about kissing and groping women.  at least 10 women have since accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. trump has denied the women’s allegations, calling them “totally and absolutely false” and has promised to sue the women after the election. trump has also deepened divisions within his party by refusing to promise to accept the outcome of the election. “i will keep you in suspense,” he said when asked about the issue  during an oct. 19 debate with clinton. the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english with american adults in all 50 states. the latest poll included 648 people who identified as republicans and 771 people who identified as democrats. it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 4 percentage points.

" kenya s supreme court on wednesday criticized the election board for failing to verify official results of last month s presidential election before announcing them, but did not find any individual at the board responsible for the failings. the court was offering a detailed ruling as to why it annulled the aug. 8 election and ordered a fresh presidential vote within 60 days. the sept. 1 decision was the first of its kind in africa. the election board had said incumbent president uhuru kenyatta won the contest by 1.4 million votes, but opposition leader raila odinga challenged the result in the supreme court. he says the previous two elections were also stolen from him. kenya is a key western ally in a region often shaken by violence. its status as a diplomatic, trade and security hub for east africa means the court s ruling and preparation for the fresh election, now scheduled for oct. 17, are being closely watched for signs of instability or violence. on monday, the french technology company supporting the election said it would be nearly impossible to be ready for that date. the court s sept. 1 ruling identified some procedural problems, but the key finding against the election board on wednesday was that officials had announced results before being able to verify them. kenya used two parallel systems: a quick electronic tally vulnerable to typos and a slower paper system designed as a verifiable, definitive back up. the official results were based on the electronic tally before the paper results were fully collated, the judges said.  the system was designed that way after a disputed 2007 presidential vote sparked violence that killed around 1,200 people and displaced some 600,000 more.  if elections are not seen to be free and fair, they can trigger instability. we do not need to look far for examples,  said chief justice david maraga. the board overseeing the 2017 vote did not have all the tally forms when it announced results, and some forms lacked security features like water marks, signatures or serial numbers, which calls their authenticity into question, the court said, adding there was no evidence of individual wrongdoing.  though the petitioner claimed various offences were committed by the issues of the first respondent, that is the iebc (elections board), no evidence was placed before us to prove that allegation,  maraga said.  we are therefore unable to impute any criminal intent or culpability.   odinga has said he will not take part in the repeat election if several demands, including the sacking of senior staff at the election board, are not met.  judge philomena mwilu said the forms should have been quickly available for inspection, noting officials said thousands of forms from polling stations were still unavailable four days after the official results were announced.   the (board) cannot therefore be said to have verified the results,  she said.  it is an inexcusable contravention ... of the election act.  she also censured the board s refusal to comply with court orders to open its computer servers, saying it meant that opposition claims of hacking or manipulation might be true.     noncompliance or failure by the board to do as ordered must be held against it,  she said. but although the tallying process was questioned, voter registration, identification and voting all appeared to have been  conducted in accordance with the law,  she said.  opposition claims against kenyatta were largely dismissed. maraga said the opposition had failed to show evidence kenyatta had campaigned using state resources or undue influence.  two judges read lengthy dissenting opinions and accused their four colleagues who issued the majority judgment of misinterpreting the law and other failings, including not paying attention to the evidence and judicial limits.  as judges spoke, police used tear gas to disperse groups of rival political supporters holding demonstrations outside the supreme court.  the election re run has divided kenya, with many opposition supporters celebrating it and the president and some members of the ruling party criticizing it harshly.  after the majority decision was read, deputy president william rut tweeted:  evidently a supreme coup on sovereign will of the people was executed on basis of technicalities against their verdict captured in ballots.  on tuesday, the chief justice told a news conference that judges were getting threats and the police were not offering adequate protection, an allegation that the chief of police denied.

" semi retired wisconsin pig farmer john lader does not think much of donald trump as a messenger, but voted for what he described as the republican president elect’s message of change and economic hope for america. “the last few years, there hasn’t been much optimism and hope among working people in rural areas in this country,” said lader, 65, who lives in the farmland outside the southern wisconsin city of janesville. around 65 miles (105 km) to the northeast in the state’s biggest city of milwaukee, jose boni, who cleans offices at a local university and rents out several homes, heard a different message: trump’s plan to build a wall on the u.s. mexican border and vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the united states illegally, most of whom are hispanic.  “he doesn’t care about our community or working people, he only cares about himself,” said boni, 57, an ecuador born u.s. citizen. the different worlds of lader and boni help illustrate the rural urban divide that was critical to the outcome of tuesday’s u.s. presidential election. a country once defined by regional voting now is more clearly divided by the differences between rural and urban voters. the combination of a strong trump turnout in the countryside and a weak showing by democrat clinton in the cities went a long way toward deciding the election. rural and small town working class white voters, who already tended to vote republican, propelled trump. urban areas, where black and hispanic voters are concentrated along with college educated voters, already leaned toward the democrats, but clinton did not get the turnout from these groups that she needed. for instance, black voters did not show up in the same numbers they did for barack obama, the first black president, in 2008 and 2012. trump beat clinton by 26 percentage points among voters who live in non metropolitan areas, while clinton bested trump by about 7 percentage points in urban areas, according to the nationwide reuters/ipsos national election day poll. steven schier, a political science professor at carleton college in northfield, minnesota, said rural voters “feel they’ve lost something, that america is moving away from them.” “trump came up with the perfect slogan for them in ‘make america great again’ because it hits them exactly where they live,” schier said. democratic presidential candidates had won in wisconsin in every election since 1988, until trump’s victory on tuesday. in wisconsin, overall turnout was lower than in the 2012 presidential election. trump actually was a few hundred votes shy of 2012 republican nominee mitt romney’s total in the state, but clinton was around 240,000 votes short of obama’s 2012 tally. she ended up around 24,000 votes behind trump in the state. “those couple hundred thousand democratic voters for whatever reason decided not to vote,” mordecai lee, a political scientist at the university of wisconsin milwaukee. “they stayed home, and wisconsin went republican. i think that was the pattern around the country.”  turnout in milwaukee’s hispanic neighborhoods was down 9 percent versus 2012, while citywide turnout in milwaukee fell 14 percent.  clinton took 65.6 percent in milwaukee county, which includes the city, to trump’s 28.6 percent. but trump won in rural counties, for example taking 59.9 percent to clinton’s 33.6 percent in fond du lac county in the middle of the state and 71.4 percent to 25.1 percent in florence county in the far north. in milwaukee, election day canvassers found trump’s comments about immigrants were not enough to get people to the polls. christine neumann ortiz, director of community group voces de la frontera, said about 15 percent of the voters reached by the group in milwaukee raised concerns about clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state or were undecided.  “if we reached people, we were able to convince them to vote, but i don’t think we could ever have reached enough by ourselves to overcome trump’s advantage with white working class voters,” neumann ortiz said. the rural landscape was rich trump territory, with people concerned about a slump in commodity prices and layoffs among manufacturers. rural areas, especially in the midwest and northeast, have also seen a demographic shift in recent years with the arrival of hispanic immigrants. demographer william frey of the brookings institution think tank in washington said census data from 2008 to 2015 showed hispanic populations in non metro counties in the midwest rose 18 percent while the white population fell 9 percent.  the counties still are 84 percent white, but those voters are feeling the change, frey said. “they’re a little bit fearful of it, and if they’re being hit hard economically, that can add to it,” frey added. austin arndt, a beef cattle farmer and neighbor of john lader outside janesville, hometown of republican speaker of the u.s. house of representatives paul ryan, said his vote was more against clinton than for trump. he said his vote was based on trump’s promise to cut taxes and repeal obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law, which has enabled millions of previously uninsured americans to gain medical coverage but is detested by conservatives as a government overreach. “from the social point of view as candidates, they were both terrible people,” said arndt, 33. “for me, it was all about the economics.”  ",0
" donald trump took over as u.s. president on friday in the same way he conducted his upstart campaign, with a mixture of blustery salesmanship and naked contempt for the established political order.  in doing so, he sent a clear signal to the country and the world: he plans to govern as he campaigned, refusing to align himself even with his own republican party and taking his message directly to the american people. he did nothing to dispel concerns that he would bring the cult of personality he built over the election campaign into the white house, and he offered little in the way of olive branches to the tens of millions of americans who did not vote for him in the most divisive election in modern u.s. history. a former reality tv star, trump offered an apocalyptic vision of reality: an america besieged by crime, immigration, terrorism and unfair trade deals.  “the american carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he pledged, as he presented himself as a champion of the ordinary american.    the gloomy picture trump sketched of the nation flies in the face of evidence that the economy is in healthy shape, crime is down and the nation is relatively safe and secure.  after warning the public on the extent of the problems, trump suggested, as he did during his campaign, that he and his “movement” are the only solution. he did not mention the republicans in congress with whom he will partner to govern and certainly not the democrats who have fiercely opposed him.  trump campaigned as an outsider, railing against the sins of both his republican party and the democratic party. and, it became clear as he delivered his speech on the steps of the capitol, that he intends to remain that outsider, the rebel leader who takes power with one foot still on the battlefield. continuing the populist themes from his campaign, he condemned the politicians who he said have for years prospered at the expense of the public.  he eschewed the high flying rhetoric typical of such occasions in favor of more blunt, populist declarations. “politicians prospered   but the jobs left, and the factories closed,” he said. “the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.” “we are transferring power from washington d.c. and giving it back to you, the american people.” aundrea friedley, 52, of nampa, idaho, who was in the crowd watching his speech, likened it to a “powerful punch” and praised trump for returning power to the people.       trump won the majority of the u.s. electoral college vote, but lost the popular vote to his opponent, hillary clinton, by nearly 3 million votes, making any attempt to unify the country that much more difficult.   “we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,” trump said. “from this day forward a new vision will govern our land. from this moment on, it’s going to be america first.” his proposals though for ramped up infrastructure spending, strong border controls and the strong isolationist tone of his speech may not jibe with traditional republican priorities. at the same time, however, trump has assuaged nervous republicans by selecting a cabinet that has largely affirmed bedrock conservative principals, and he plans to quickly begin signing executive orders designed to roll back some of former president barack obama’s progressive policies. in trump’s speech, historians said, there were echoes of franklin d. roosevelt with trump mentioning “the forgotten” americans left behind by the forces of trade and globalization, of richard nixon’s “silent majority”, and of ronald reagan’s pledge to restore the nation’s greatness.  but, said julian zelizer, a historian at princeton university, there was also “more anger physically and verbally than in the past” with trump punctuating his speech with pointed hand gestures.  trump spent little time trying to expand his appeal to the  majority of americans who view him unfavorably, according to opinion polls. instead, he appeared to speak directly to his most fervent supporters. his speech perhaps was most reflective of reagan’s 1981 address, in which the then president spoke of “economic affliction” and “idle industries.”but reagan inherited an economy struggling with stagflation and an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent. by contrast, under the departing obama, the economy has added private sector jobs in 80 consecutive months and the unemployment rate stands at 4.7 percent.  the picture painted by trump “is probably not one that every american shares,” said thomas alan schwartz, a presidential historian at vanderbilt university. still, he said, trump has tapped into a “sense of national crisis and decline.”     belinda bee, 56, came to see trump from mooresville, north carolina, saying she believed he would successfully combat islamic terrorism and that he would remain a political outsider. “the country now belongs to the people and not the politicians,” she said.

" one of liberia s leading political parties called for a halt in announcing the result of tuesday s presidential election, citing irregularities in the vote.  the liberty party, whose candidate charles brumskine was considered a front runner to take over from nobel peace prize winner ellen johnson sirleaf, said it would consider taking legal action if the national elections commission (nec) did not act on its demands. the nec was originally expected to release preliminary results on thursday.   the liberty party is deeply troubled by the discovery of numerous incidents of irregularities and fraud that occurred during the elections,  liberty party national chairman benjamin sanvee said in a statement.   we are calling on nec to immediately halt further announcements of election results. if nec does not cooperate with our request, we will take the appropriate legal action,  he said. he did not give specific evidence of voter fraud and it was unclear what kind of activity could have altered tuesday s vote.  an nec spokesman told reuters that it was unaware of the liberty party s complaint and did not say whether the commission believed illegal acts occurred.  on election day, materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls, witnesses said, but there was so far no evidence that this was linked to illicit activity. any irregularities would taint the results of an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago. liberia, africa s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943. johnson sirleaf, africa s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post war transition. she was re elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term.

" gaza s merchants and consumers are reaping early rewards from reconciliation moves by the enclave s dominant hamas islamists and the western backed palestinian authority (pa). israeli border restrictions, including a nearly blanket ban on exports from gaza, and three wars since 2008 have imposed severe hardship in the territory. israel says its rules are driven by security concerns, accusing hamas of having used imported material to build weapons including rockets that have been fired at its cities. since hamas ceded gaza s border crossings with israel   the main gateway for commercial imports   to the authority on nov 1 under an egyptian brokered unity deal, many prices in the territory have dropped. the main reason for the decrease: the authority has canceled surcharges, sometimes as high as 25 percent, that hamas collected in cash from merchants in gaza. businesses, in turn, have passed on some of those savings to customers: a 2017 kia picanto compact car, for example, now sells for $20,000 instead of $22,500, and a kilo of beef costs 40 shekels ($11), down from 50 ($15). and this week, the pa, which takes its own tax in an arrangement agreed with israel, allowed the import of cigarettes costing eight shekels a pack compared with the usual 21 shekels for other brands, through israel s kerem shalom commercial crossing for the first time. cigarettes used to come in only via smuggling tunnels under the egyptian border but the pa is seeking understandings with hamas and cairo to choke off that channel.  (hamas s fees) led to a weakening of sales power because the people in gaza live under bad economic conditions and because of the israeli blockade and the loss of jobs,  said tareq al saqqa, who owns an electrical goods company in gaza, where unemployment tops 40 percent. citing security concerns, israel and egypt maintain tight restrictions at their gaza borders. hamas, regarded by the west as a terrorist group, seized the enclave in fighting in 2007 against forces loyal to palestinian president mahmoud abbas. israel s limits on gaza s import of so called  dual use  material, such as steel and cement, that it fears could be used by hamas to make weapons or fortifications are unlikely to change soon. but hundreds of truckloads of food and a wide variety of consumer goods move into gaza daily via israel. hamas, which handed administrative control of gaza to the authority under the reconciliation agreement signed in cairo on oct. 12, has spurned israel s demand it disarm.   israel said it would deal with the new administration in gaza but in the way that would not allow hamas and other factions to develop their military capabilities, which means it will continue to ban essential materials,  said mohammad abu jayyab, a gaza economist. he and other local economic experts cautioned against any hopes of a rapid revival of gaza s economy unless israel s restrictions were fully removed.  responsibility for security in still an open issue in gaza, where hamas, which is still policing the territory, has what analysts say are at least 25,000 well equipped fighters. further unity talks are scheduled for nov. 21 in cairo. keeping pressure on hamas, abbas has yet to lift economic sanctions he imposed in gaza in june that included a cut in salaries the authority paid to 60,000 civil servants. abbas recently sent nearly 15,000 of them into early retirement.

" european union leaders welcomed a proposal by british prime minister theresa may aimed at unblocking brexit talks, but said concessions to ease the fears of eu citizens living in britain were not enough. arriving at a two day summit in brussels on thursday with other eu leaders, may sought to shift the focus away from a failure to push the talks beyond a discussion of a divorce settlement and onto trade talks just 17 months before britain is due to leave. instead the prime minister, weakened after losing her conservative party s majority in a june election, put renewed emphasis on settling citizens rights, one of three issues that must be solved to break the deadlock in talks. but eu leaders said there was more work to be done, with german chancellor angela merkel describing some  encouraging  signs that could help pave the way for a discussion on future trade ties at the next eu summit in december. may said the leaders assess the progress that has been made so far in the brexit talks and set out  ambitious plans  for the weeks ahead.  i particularly, for example, want to see an urgency in reaching an agreement on citizens  rights,  may told reporters. but she avoided questions about increasing the amount britain is willing to pay when it leaves, instead referring back to a speech last month in italy when she outlined an offer of around 20 billion euros ($24 billion). may will discuss her brexit strategy over dinner. on friday morning, once she has left, other eu leaders are expected to say the talks have not yet made enough progress for them to open the trade negotiations. weakened after losing her conservative party s majority in a june election and failing to rally support at an ill fated party conference, may is constrained in her ability to address eu demands that she increase her pay offer for the divorce agreement. some members of her own party would prefer to see her walk away if the eu does not agree to move the talks forward to discuss trade. germany and its allies do not want to be left with a large bill when britain leaves the bloc in march 2019. merkel said eu leaders would listen to the report from their chief negotiator michel barnier, but that sufficient progress had not yet been made.  we will continue the talks with a view to reaching the second phase in december . irish prime minister leo varadkar urged may to  come up with more clarity  not only on guarantees on citizens rights, but also on her plans to avoid a return of a hard border with northern ireland.  these are still difficult issues, but particularly the question of the exit bill,  he told reporters. may tried to shift the focus away from how much britain should pay. on her facebook page, she wrote that  we are in touching distance of agreement  for protecting the rights of around 3 million eu citizens living in britain and promised to make it as easy as possible for them to stay. luxembourg s prime minister xavier bettel told reporters the facebook post  went in the right direction  and that  every movement in the right direction is important , noting a change in tone in the british government over the past six months. but finland s leader, juha sipila, said the eu was  a little bit frustrated about the progress.  the lack of movement has increased the pressure on may from inside her own party. in an open letter on thursday, pro brexit lawmakers and business people said that unless the deadlock was broken, britain should signal it is ready to be subject to world trade organization (wto) rules from march 30, 2019, when brexit takes effect. owen paterson, a lawmaker and former minister from may s conservative party, said it looked  inevitable  that the trade relationship between britain and the eu would end up being governed by wto rules, meaning no special deal.  so what we re saying is it would be much better to state that now, give business and all our administrative organisations certainty so they can begin to prepare,  he said.

" the white house urged malaysia on thursday to demonstrate good governance and a transparent business climate, a day after u.s. prosecutors sued to try and seize $1 billion in assets they said were bought with money stolen from a state development fund. the civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of president barack obama, who has visited the southeast asian nation twice in the last two years. the lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a u.s. congressional aide. “it has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. corruption in malaysia is a huge problem,” the aide said. no criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding malaysia’s 1mdb sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by malaysian prime minister najib razak. obama spoke generally with najib on a visit to malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, white house spokesman josh earnest said at a news briefing. “for business interests who are considering doing business in malaysia, they’re going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate,” earnest told reporters. the malaysian government “should be conspicuous about making clear that they’re committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in malaysia’s fast growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly,” earnest said. najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1mdb case. malaysia’s foreign minister anifah aman met the u.s. ambassador to malaysia joseph yun on thursday to discuss the lawsuits. “malaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the united states and calls on the u.s. to recognize the various steps taken by the government of malaysia to address the 1mdb issue,” the ministry said in a statement on thursday night. malaysia’s attorney general mohamed apandi ali, however, expressed “strong concerns at the insinuations and allegations” of wrongdoing against najib in the lawsuits.  he said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1mdb. the u.s. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the justice department’s kleptocracy asset recovery initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption. targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie “the wolf of wall street” and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1mdb. 1mdb said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the united states, “nor has it benefited from the various transactions described.” ",0
" he is anti gay, pro gun and warns that china is taking over brazil. and with one year to go before brazil s presidential election, right wing congressman jair bolsonaro is running second in opinion polls. bolsonaro, a 62 year old former paratrooper, lacks a major party behind him but hopes to emulate donald trump s unexpected rise to the u.s. presidency with the support of brazilians fed up with corrupt politicians and bad government.  trump faced the same attacks i am facing   that he was a homophobe, a fascist, a racist, a nazi   but the people believed in his platform, and i was rooting for him,  bolsonaro told reuters in an interview this week in his office in brasilia, decorated with the portraits of five military presidents from brazil s 1964 1985 dictatorship. a seven term congressman, bolsonaro is emerging as the law and order and anti corruption candidate for the october 2018 vote. his support is fed by a surge in violent crime and brazil s worst ever graft scandal, which has implicated much of the political class, including president michel temer. for many disillusioned voters in latin america s largest country, bolsonaro s appeal lies in his clean record, with not a single allegation of graft raised against him. many others in the catholic country, however, are outraged by misogynist comments and outspoken support for brazil s former military dictatorship, including its use of torture. bolsonaro is appealing a conviction for inciting violence after he told a female congresswoman on the floor of the lower house that he  would not rape her because she did not deserve it.  after a high ranking army officer, general antonio mour o, warned this month the military could seize power if brazil s courts do not punish corrupt politicians, bolsonaro played down the remark.  it was just a warning. nobody wants to seize power that way,  he said, adding with a smile:  maybe we could have a military man winning in 2018, but through elections.   battling what he sees as a hostile press, bolsonaro aims to use social media to deliver his message directly to voters, as trump did successfully in the u.s. election last year. his facebook page has more followers than any other politician in brazil   4.5 million. a poll by datafolha in june put him second in voting intentions for the 2018 elections, at 16 percent, trailing only former president luiz inacio lula da silva, at 30 percent, who has been convicted of corruption and could be barred from running. however, political watchers say bolsonaro s appeal is likely to wane as opponents play on his divisive comments. his rejection rate of 30 percent is only surpassed by lula s 46 percent and the governor of sao paulo geraldo alckmin s 34 percent. bolsonaro s homophobic reputation arose from his strident opposition to same sex unions and attacks on a sexual education program for schools that he said encouraged homosexuality. he has maintained that adoption of children by same sex couples is tantamount to pedophilia. as he prepares for a presidential run, bolsonaro has moderated his rhetoric, telling reuters that politics had no place in the bedroom and what adults did between the sheets was a private matter. but he won t budge on other policies such as easing gun control laws so any brazilian can purchase a weapon. he said pro gun bills he has sponsored should win approval in a more conservative congress elected in 2018. while pledging to continue current efforts to reduce red tape and the size of the state, bolsonaro would not privatize companies considered strategic, such as state run oil company petrobras   a national development strategy espoused by brazil s military governments. if elected, bolsonaro s priority in foreign affairs would be to strengthen ties with washington, especially with trump in the white house. he would aim to make the united states brazil s main trade partner, a position it lost to china in 2009.  china is taking over brazil and that is worrying. they are investing in mining, agriculture, energy, ports and airports,  bolsonaro said, pledging to restrict chinese investors from buying brazilian companies. at the end of the interview, bolsonaro stood up and saluted in front of the portraits of the five military presidents.     outside, people lined up to get selfies with him.  i want a photo. he is the only politician who has not stolen,  said marcos, 18, a student from goias state.

" the united nations human rights chief said on monday that venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. but venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of president nicolas maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  my investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  zeid ra ad al hussein told the u.n. human rights council. he said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. last month, zeid s office said venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  there is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  zeid said. the opposition, which boycotted the election for the constituent assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn out figures for the july 30 vote. however, foreign minister jorge arreaza told the geneva forum:  we have now selected the national constituent assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. it will have the powers to draw up a new constitution.    the opposition in venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on july 30.  our country is now at peace,  he added. venezuela is among the 47 members of the council, where it enjoys strong support from cuba, iran and other states. diego arria, who was venezuela s ambassador to the united nations in new york from 1991 to 1994, told a separate geneva event organized by activists and action group un watch that venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the international criminal court.  i am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. the hague based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  julieta lopez, aunt of opposition leader leopoldo lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  there is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event.

" germany has extended temporary passport controls on its border with austria and for flights coming from greece for six more months amid continuing concerns about attacks and illegal immigration, the interior ministry said on thursday. the european commission last month offered initial backing to a franco german proposal to allow more permanent border checks within the bloc s schengen free travel zone. germany notified the european commission, the council of the european union, the president of the european parliament and the interior ministers of the eu schengen states about its decision in a letter on wednesday. the commission allowed germany to control its border with austria in 2015 after a surge of refugees and migrants began arriving in western europe. the temporary permission was due to expire on nov. 11. immigration will be a key issue in coalition talks by chancellor angela merkel s conservatives, the pro business free democrats and the environmentalist greens.  interior minister thomas de maiziere justified germany s move given continued security concerns, and said a complete return to free travel within the schengen area was contingent on an improvement in the overall situation. germany was hit by five islamist attacks in 2016, including one in december on a berlin christmas market that killed 12 people.  we are working hard on this, all member states, the eu commission and the eu council, but there is still a long way to go,  de maiziere said in a statement. border controls also apply to flights to germany from greece, which was the gateway for thousands of migrants from iraq and syria. ministry data on wednesday showed that 140,000 asylum seekers have registered in germany since the beginning of 2017.

" u.s. president donald trump’s lawyer on tuesday denied that he or trump colluded with russia to interfere in last year’s presidential election, and said such charges were meant to discredit trump’s presidency. “i emphatically state that i had nothing to do with any russian involvement in our electoral process,” michael cohen said in a statement prepared for a scheduled meeting with senate intelligence committee investigators that was ultimately postponed. “given my own proximity to the president of the united states as a candidate, let me also say that i never saw anything   not a hint of anything   that demonstrated his involvement in russian interference in our election or any form of russia collusion,” cohen said. after the statement was reported by media organizations on tuesday morning, cohen and his attorney, stephen ryan, traveled to capitol hill for a closed door interview with intelligence committee investigators   but were told that the committee had decided to postpone the meeting. the senate committee, as well as other congressional panels and special counsel robert mueller, are investigating russia’s reported interference in the 2016 election and whether trump or his top aides colluded with moscow. cohen’s name surfaced in a dossier, compiled by former british intelligence officer christopher steele, that reported cohen played an important role in liaison with the russian government and secretly met with kremlin officials in prague in august 2016. the steele dossier, cohen said in his statement, is “riddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.” “i have never in my life been to prague or to anywhere in the czech republic,” he said. current and former u.s. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely. it was not immediately clear why cohen’s meeting with senate investigators was postponed. “the committee has chosen to postpone today’s interview and we will come back for a voluntary interview whenever we can to meet with them,” ryan told reporters. “mr. cohen will continue to co operate.” cohen said in his statement that the collusion charges are meant to discredit trump’s presidency. “i’m also certain that there are some in this country who do not care about the facts, but simply want to politicize this issue, choosing to presume guilt   rather than presuming innocence   so as to discredit our lawfully elected president in the public eye,” he said.

" early last year, leandro colmenares sold his car and his apartment and fled venezuela s profound economic crisis, joining a wave of emigration to other latin american countries. colmenares, a medical equipment repairman, first set up in panama with $7,000 in hand. when he could not get a visa and struggled to find work, he ended up with odd jobs like painting houses and doing electrical wiring for $25 a day.  in venezuela, i was rubbing shoulders with doctors. months later i was mopping the floor in a panama furniture shop,  said colmenares, who has two sons, including one who is disabled.  he then tried his luck in colombia, where he again took odd jobs, mostly cooking. he opened a small cafe with other venezuelans but it failed.   it was bad, i was going hungry. on weekends i ate once,  he said. and once again, he could not get a visa.  crushed and having run out of money, colmenares decided in february he had no choice but return to venezuela empty handed and by bus   one of an apparently growing number of venezuelan emigrants forced to go home after failing to start a new life elsewhere in latin america. these recent migrants are often poor, hopping on buses to latin american capitals with as little as a few hundred dollars and scant prospect of finding a decent job.  the country i left was bad. when i came back it was worse,  said colmenares, noting steep prices and ever less food on store shelves. he spends his days in his home in poor central caracas, scraping out a living making dough for corn patties. for decades after world war ii, venezuela s flourishing oil economy made it a destination for mass immigration from southern europe, with portuguese bakeries and spanish bars a common sight across caracas.   but during 18 years of socialist rule, an increase in crime, economic decay and political protests have prompted emigration to miami, madrid, and the rest of latin america.  sociologist tomas paez estimates over 2 million venezuelans have left the country of 30 million, accelerating in the last two years as the opec member s recession has worsened, leading to shortages of vital medicines and food, runaway inflation and lack of formal jobs. while the early diaspora was mostly a middle class phenomenon, recent migrants are more likely to be poor, heightening the chances that they will struggle.  there is no data on returnees but reuters interviewed 10 venezuelans who had emigrated after president nicolas maduro took office in 2013 only to return.  for miguel blanco, a caracas based sociologist, the degree of poverty among people now leaving the country has led to more of them returning.  when migration is triggered by push factors, it can lead the migrant to fail because of lack of money,  said blanco. pockets of venezuelan economic migrants, once a relatively rare sight in south america, have sprung up in cities from bogota to santiago de chile. they are often seen hawking traditional corn patties on the streets or offering door to door beauty treatments.      panama s head of migration said in august that some 2,000 venezuelans were setting up there every week, compared with  about 500 to 600 before august, when maduro s government created a legislative superbody that was widely condemned by the opposition and other countries as a power grab.  with about 60,000 venezuelans already in panama, the government has implemented visas as an entry requirement.  peru has estimated that in the first half of 2017 some 40,000 venezuelans entered the country.  venezuelan government supporters have said the extent of emigration has been exaggerated. maduro s administration scoffs at those who leave as selfish and unpatriotic. the information ministry did not respond to a request for data.  colombia, which shares a porous border of some 2,219 kilometers with venezuela, has estimated that about 36,000 venezuelans enter daily, and that some 2,000 do not immediately return to their country.   gerson lopez, a 30 year old graphic designer, said he was paid less by a colombian beauty product company because he did not have legal documents.   informal work there is very exploitative,  said lopez.  venezuelans are doing the work colombians don t want to do.   lopez was broke when he returned to venezuela in late january after being unable to find good work in bogota.   you have to think very hard if you re going to leave,  he said, adding bitterly,  (but) here you don t have any opportunities. all you do is survive.

" vice president mike pence took the rare step of breaking a tie in the u.s. senate on thursday, casting the deciding vote to roll back protections for reproductive health funds.  using the congressional review act, which allows lawmakers to repeal recently minted regulations, senators killed a rule intended to keep federal grants flowing to clinics that provide contraception and other services in states that want to block the funding. the rule was enacted in the final weeks of former president barack obama’s administration, giving lawmakers the opening to nullify it under the review law. in recent years states such as texas have kept some healthcare providers from receiving the grants as part of the country’s longstanding fight over abortion.  it was the second time on thursday that pence used his role as the chamber’s president to end a deadlock. he was called to the capitol earlier to carry the resolution through a procedural vote.  saying the rule usurps states’ rights, republicans argued local lawmakers should decide how healthcare money is distributed.  their main concern is that federal money is being used to provide abortions, although the grants are specifically barred from funding those procedures. republicans, including president donald trump, generally oppose abortion. “this regulation is an unnecessary restriction on states that know their residents’ own needs best,” said republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. democrats said the resolution was an attack on women’s health, contending the rollback will make it harder for low income and rural women to obtain screenings for cancer and other diseases, as well as contraception. most resolutions killing recent obama era regulations have sailed through the republican controlled congress. they need to win only simple majorities in both chambers to go to the president for signing. the congressional review law was used only once successfully until this year. the family planning resolution marked the 13th time it has been deployed effectively since the beginning of february, as well as the first time a resolution has come within a hair’s breadth of failing. “republicans didn’t listen to us,” said senator patty murray of washington, the senior democrat on the health committee. “they didn’t listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women’s access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable.”  the nonprofit planned parenthood, which provides abortions  and many other health and contraception services, receives some of the federal funding.  noting the recent collapse of the republican healthcare bill in the u.s. house of representatives, dawn laguens, executive vice president of planned parenthood federation of america, said thursday’s votes were close because “people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access healthcare.” ",0
" leading u.s. senate democrats on monday urged quick passage of legislation defeated last year to impose additional gun controls in the wake of the weekend mass shooting in florida. four democratic senators, led by chuck schumer of new york, the no. 2 senate democrat, called for immediate passage of a bill preventing people on “terror watch lists” and other “suspected terrorists” from buying firearms or explosives. last december, democrats attempted to pass this legislation but were blocked by republicans, who said the government could mistakenly place innocent people on watch lists. the new push for legislation came after a man with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. the gunman subsequently was killed by law enforcement officers. federal agents had interviewed the gunman twice in recent years. joining schumer in calling for passage of the legislation are senators dianne feinstein of california, bill nelson of florida and richard blumenthal of connecticut. meanwhile, democratic president barack obama on monday blamed weak gun laws for allowing disturbed individuals to gain access to powerful weapons. hillary clinton, the leading democratic candidate to replace obama in the white house, said people on watch lists should be barred from buying guns and said there should be a debate about possible restrictions on assault weapons. donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, took a different approach, repeating his call for temporarily banning muslims from entering the country. the orlando gunman was born in the united states. his parents were afghan immigrants.",0

" north carolina’s republican controlled legislature on wednesday rejected a bid to repeal a state law restricting bathroom access for transgender people, which has drawn months of protests and boycotts by opponents decrying the measure as discriminatory. a one day special legislative session ended abruptly after the state senate voted against abolishing a law that has made north carolina the latest u.s. battleground over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) rights. the repeal legislation was rejected 32 16, leaving the bathroom restrictions in place statewide. the rejection followed republican led political maneuvering that tied repeal to a second provision that would have temporarily banned cities from affirming transgender bathroom rights. democratic senator jeff jackson said the repeal effort failed because republicans reneged on their deal to bring the measure to a floor vote with no strings attached. the moratorium on municipal bathroom regulations, described by jackson as a “poison pill,” withered democratic support, and in the end all 16 senate democrats joined 16 republicans in voting against repeal. another 16 republicans voted for it. the senate then adjourned without acting on the temporary municipal ban. the state’s house of representatives had already called it quits. democratic governor elect roy cooper accused republican leaders of back peddling on an agreement ironed out in lengthy negotiations. he said both chambers had the votes for a full repeal, but divisions within the republican party killed it. “the republican legislative leaders have broken their word to me, and they have broken their trust with the people of north carolina,” he said. senate republican leader phil berger earlier defended the proposal to link repeal with temporary municipal restrictions as a genuine attempt at compromise, citing “the passion and disagreement surrounding this issue.” after the vote, outgoing republican governor pat mccrory blamed “well funded left wing interest groups” that he said “sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes.” earlier in the week, mccrory had called the special session to consider scrapping the law, which passed in march and made north carolina the first state to bar transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity. supporters of the statute, known as house bill 2 (hb 2), have cited traditional values and a need for public safety, while opponents called it mean spirited, unnecessary and a violation of civil liberties. the national backlash was swift and fierce, leading to boycotts that have been blamed for millions of dollars in economic losses for the state as events, such as business conferences and the national basketball association’s 2017 all star game, were moved out of north carolina. the pushback contributed to mccrory’s razor thin defeat in a fall re election bid against cooper, an opponent of the law.  hb 2 was enacted largely in response to a local measure in charlotte that protected the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms of their choice. the charlotte city council on monday repealed its ordinance as a prelude to the state repealing hb 2. civil liberties and lgbt rights groups condemned the outcome, accusing the legislature of breaking its promise to do away with hb 2. “it is a shame that north carolina’s general assembly is refusing to clean up the mess they made,” said james esseks, an american civil liberties union executive.  the north carolina values coalition hailed the legislature for upholding the law and refusing to give in to “demands of greedy businesses, immoral sports organizations or angry mobs.” ",0
 puerto rican governor alejandro garcia padilla on thursday issued an executive order authorizing the suspension of payment on approximately $800 million worth of constitutionally guaranteed general obligation bonds due on july 1.     the suspension follows u.s. president barack obama’s signing into law earlier on thursday of a plan that gives a federal oversight board authority for negotiating the restructuring of the island’s $70 billion debt and bringing the struggling u.s. territory’s finances under control. ,0
" u.s. democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton begins a two day tour on monday through rural, traditionally coal reliant parts of the eastern appalachian region where republican rival donald trump’s pro coal, anti trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters.  clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in kentucky, west virginia and ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices. her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in march when clinton, at an ohio town hall, said the country would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” clinton’s statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and republican lawmakers such as u.s. senators rand paul and mitch mcconnell, both from kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out president barack obama’s regulatory “war” on coal. clinton immediately sent an apology letter to democratic u.s. senator joe manchin of west virginia, an early supporter, pledging to “focus my team and administration on bringing jobs to appalachia” and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the u.s. energy market. her decision to embark on an appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of democratic nominating contests in west virginia on may 10 and in kentucky on may 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the party’s july convention. clinton won ohio’s contest in mid march, besting rival bernie sanders, a u.s. senator from vermont. however, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now.  clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, campaigned on sunday in west virginia, encountering protests from trump supporters and being asked about clinton’s town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in kentucky on tuesday. west virginia last voted for a democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when bill clinton was running for his second four year term. he is the only democrat who has won kentucky since 1980. during her first presidential run, clinton defeated obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. her tour is an early move to siphon support from trump, the front runner for the republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority. clinton’s first stop, at a restaurant in ashland, kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when ak steel holding corp announced in october that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices. clinton last month criticized china’s announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on chinese trade practices. she will continue to williamson, west virginia, a once thriving town near the state’s border with kentucky in mingo county, the heart of the coal producing region. its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. the town is now trying to reshape its economy. clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the williamson health and wellness center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health focused, local foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large scale agricultural development. aides say clinton’s interest in the region’s economic troubles was piqued after she left the u.s. state department in 2013. she circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less educated white adults in appalachia, where the decline in coal related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues. clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to “shirk” the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

" u.s. president donald trump attacked venezuela s authoritarian government from the podium at the united nations this week but latin american leaders say that behind the scenes he listened to them on how best to resolve the delicate regional crisis. latin american leaders who dined with trump on monday on the fringes of the u.n. general assembly said they told him that a military invasion, a threat he casually made last month, would be unacceptable in a region long sensitive to heavy handed intervention by washington. they pressed on him the need for a peaceful transition to democracy in venezuela and argued against economic sanctions that would deepen its humanitarian crisis, which has already sent tens of thousands fleeing to neighboring countries.  trump went to the trouble of asking us how best to solve the venezuelan situation,  argentine foreign minister jorge faurie, who attended the dinner, told reuters.  that the united states would consult latin american counties on what to do is in itself a major step forward.   at the united nations general assembly this week, trump attacked the socialist government of president nicolas maduro for destroying a once wealthy oil producing nation. he threatened to increase sanctions if maduro did not move toward restoring democratic rule. but trump steered clear of repeating the threat of military action he made on aug. 11 which alarmed latin americans. for many, it conjured memories of the 1989 u.s. invasion of panama that overthrew dictator manuel noriega, who died in may after years in prison in the united states and his own country. at least 125 people were killed in venezuela during four months of protests this year against maduro, who has resisted calls to bring forward a presidential election and instead set up a legislative superbody to overrule the opposition led congress. while no decisions were taken, the talks between trump and the presidents of brazil, colombia and panama, and the vice president of argentina put pressure on maduro to engage in real negotiations with his opponents instead of using talks to gain time, latin american leaders said. brazilian president michel temer told reporters after the dinner those present had agreed to ramp up pressure on venezuela without direct intervention. president juan carlos varela of panama said the dinner with trump strengthened an initiative by a dozen latin american countries and canada to back a new round of negotiations between maduro and his opponents.  there will be more pressure to convince maduro to accept free and democratic elections in 2018,  varela told reuters.  we think maduro is getting the message that change must come.  purchases of crude and refined products from venezuela represented 7 percent of total u.s. oil imports in the first half of the year, giving washington some leverage to push for political change in the south american nation.  yet an oil embargo   which would deprive the maduro government of its main source of income   was not discussed at the dinner with trump, several attendees said.   much of venezuelan oil is heavy in sulfur and used for heating oil and asphalt, but is also refined into gasoline, mainly by u.s. gulf refiners. gulf state senators have urged trump not to ban imports, which would hurt refineries and push up gasoline prices.   colombian foreign minister mar a angela holguin said an oil boycott would only extend the suffering of the venezuelan people, who are facing shortages of food and medicine.  we have to think of the venezuelans who would suffer even more if the economic crisis deepens,  she said. formal negotiations with the opposition are due to begin in the dominican capital of santo domingo on sept. 27 and involve observers from mexico, chile, nicaragua and bolivia. argentina s faurie said the maduro government would have to agree to several conditions for talks to be taken seriously, including a calendar for elections monitored by international observers and the release of political prisoners. eric farnsworth, vice president of the americas society, a business forum dedicated to fostering ties between the united states and latin america, said the talks between trump and regional leaders sent a clear message to maduro.  the most important thing that came out of the dinner was the photograph showing the president and the vice president of the united states sitting down with regional leaders to talk about venezuela,  farnsworth said.

" a round of syria peace talks that ended on thursday was a big missed opportunity but there may be more talks next month if ideas can be found to encourage president bashar al assad s government to engage, u.n. mediator staffan de mistura said. he said neither side had actually  sabotaged  the latest talks by refusing to attend, but he laid most of the blame for the failure of the round at the feet of the government side.    de mistura voiced milder disappointment with the syrian opposition, after they arrived in geneva ruling out any future role for assad. but he said that tough public stance had been tempered by a mature position in the closed door discussions.  the goal we had was to bring about real negotiations,  de mistura told a news conference.  let me be frank. we did not achieve, we did not achieve these negotiations. in other words, negotiations in reality did not take place.  i would conclude by saying (it was) a big missed opportunity. a golden opportunity at the end of this year when in fact there is a clear indication by many sides that the military operations are coming to a close,  he added. de mistura said he was leaving geneva for consultations in new york with u.n. secretary general antonio guterres, followed by a meeting with the u.n. security council on tuesday.  i will probably need to come up with new ideas, parameters, about how to move the talks forward, particularly on constitution and elections,  he said, adding that plans for a new round of geneva talks in january depended on their outcome. civil war has ravaged syria for more than six years. chief opposition negotiator nasr hariri said the international community needed to do more to persuade government negotiator bashar al ja afari to come to the table, warning that the talks were in  great danger .  the international community needs to find a new approach, otherwise this stalemate will continue and unfortunately it will be at the expense of syrians,  he said. one european diplomat said the talks had been a  charade  because of the government s behavior.  although the regime has presented itself here, that is all that it has done. i would go further: it s not just a kind of disengagement that they ve shown, it s an extraordinary contempt,  he said.  i understand that a large amount of their time here was spent negotiating personal admin matters and expenses, rather than the substance of the talks.  as he left the talks, ja afari accused the opposition, backed by western countries and saudi arabia, of sabotaging the round. ja afari said damascus did not want the talks to fail but the opposition had put down a precondition last month by concluding a conference known as  riyadh 2  with a declaration that assad had no role in syria s political transition. de mistura said the damascus government had wanted him to insist that the opposition withdraw the statement.  that was not possible or a logical approach because to me it sounded like a precondition. the government engaged me with only on (discussions about) terrorism. the truth is there is not one single subject they accepted except that one.

" the largest u.s. veterans service organization on thursday urged president donald trump to veto recent legislation allowing financial companies to block customers from banding together to sue, saying it would hurt members of the armed forces. the american legion, which rarely speaks out on bank policy or politics, said in a statement it would “not be silent while banks and payday loan shops rip off servicemembers and veterans”. but it will likely have a hard time convincing trump to veto the resolution to roll back the obama era policy.  the consumer financial protection bureau, an independent federal regulator, finalized a rule this summer that barred banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to agree not to join group lawsuits and only take any potential disputes to closed door arbitration.  in a vote of 51 to 50, the senate on tuesday passed a resolution killing the rule and prohibiting regulators from enacting a similar one in the future. the house of representatives approved the resolution earlier, and now all that is needed to erase the rule is for trump to sign it into law. “our membership has stated unequivocally that we are opposed to situations where our military and veterans’ financial protections are chipped away to increase the profits of the big banks,” said american legion national commander denise rohan. “repealing the cfpb arbitration rule takes away consumers’ most effective tool to protect themselves against predatory lenders.” servicemembers can struggle to sue companies individually because they cannot afford legal costs, move frequently for work, or are deployed overseas, the legion said. in class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs. many veteran organizations tried for months to stop the republican led congress from passing the resolution, and other advocacy groups have also pressed for a veto. that is a long shot. the white house issued a statement shortly after tuesday’s vote applauding the resolution, saying the cfpb rule would have given consumers “fewer options for quickly and efficiently resolving financial disputes” and opened “the door to frivolous lawsuits by special interest trial lawyers.” the rule’s supporters say arbitration is rigged against consumers because it is secretive, does not set legal precedent,  and is controlled by the companies. they also say the right to sue is enshrined in the u.s. constitution.

" former fbi director james comey, who was fired by u.s. president donald trump, has signed a deal for a book on leadership and decision making that will come out in spring 2018, the publisher said on wednesday. the book deal with macmillan’s flatiron books comes three months after comey’s firing raised questions about whether trump tried to interfere with the federal bureau of investigation’s probe into russia’s alleged meddling with the u.s. presidential election.  russia denies any interference, and trump has denied collusion with russia and interfering with the investigation. the book, which has not yet been given a title, will discuss “what good, ethical leadership looks like and how it drives sound decisions,” bob miller, president of macmillan’s flatiron books, said in a statement on wednesday. flatiron won the rights to the book after an auction and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  in addition to reflections on comey’s interactions with trump this year, the book will feature anecdotes from his role in leading an investigation into the use of a private email server by democrat hillary clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign.  comey’s announcement that the fbi was reopening the clinton email investigation days before the november election led to accusations by some democrats that he was unfairly influencing the outcome. the fbi eventually closed the probe without taking any action.

" the search for an argentine navy submarine missing in the south atlantic for one week reached a  critical phase  on wednesday as the 44 crew on board could be running low on oxygen, a navy spokesman said. dozens of planes and boats were searching for the ara san juan, a mission that has plunged relatives of the sailors into an anguished wait for news and transfixed the south american country of 44 million people.   if the german built submarine, in service for more than three decades, had sunk or was otherwise unable to rise to the surface since it gave its last location on nov. 15, it would be using up the last of its seven day oxygen supply.  we are in the critical phase...particularly with respect to oxygen,  navy spokesman enrique balbi told reporters.  there has been no contact with anything that could be the san juan submarine.  relatives of the crew members have gathered at a naval base in mar del plata, where the search is coordinated. their concern grew as the hours ticked by. the craft was probably on the seabed because the mechanism to surface either failed or was not activated by a crew member, naval investigator fernando morales told reuters in a telephone interview.  if the captain stayed at the bottom because he thought it was more prudent to stay at the bottom, it s one thing. but at this point we have to think that if he s at the bottom, it s because he could not emerge,  morales said. in an evening news conference, balbi said an unusual noise was detected on nov. 15, near where the submarine last reported its position. he declined to say if the sound indicated an explosion or emergency on the vessel. data on the noise were being analyzed, he added. favorable weather allowed search boats to cover a greater area after being hampered by strong winds and waves for much of the past few days, balbi said. poor weather was expected to return on thursday. around 30 boats and planes and 4,000 people from argentina, the united states, britain, chile and brazil have joined the search for the submarine, which last transmitted its location about 480 km (300 miles) from the coast.  planes have covered some 500,000 square km (190,000 square miles) of the ocean surface, but much of the area has not yet been scoured by the boats. argentines have been gripped by the search, with local newspapers placing photographs on their front pages of crew members  relatives praying. the case has dominated discussion on social media in argentina, with the hash tags  los 44  (the 44) and (navy spokesman)  enrique balbi  becoming trending topics on twitter. comparisons were made to the most recent major rescue operation in the region, when 33 miners in northern chile were rescued in 2010 after 69 days trapped underground. the submarine was en route from ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to the coastal city of mar del plata, some 400 km (250 miles) south of buenos aires, when it reported an electrical malfunction shortly before disappearing last week. the submarine was launched in 1983 and underwent maintenance in 2008 in argentina. the disappearance has highlighted the dwindling resources and lack of training faced by the armed forces since the end of a military dictatorship in the early 1980s.

" norway s liberal party will launch formal negotiations to join the right wing cabinet of prime minister erna solberg, it said on saturday, although the government would still be ruling in a minority even if the small centrist group is included. informal talks have taken place since the government won re election in september, and bringing in the liberals could give a boost to policies favoring small businesses, the environment and education.  we are going to give ourselves a chance ... to find a common platform we can agree on,  liberal party leader trine skei grande told a meeting of her party in parliament on saturday, adding it would be a  challenging and difficult  process. adding the liberals to the coalition of the conservatives and the anti immigration progress party could make day to day governing easier for solberg, although she would still require backing from another small party, the christian democrats. the prime minister has sought to include both of the small centrist groups, but the christian democrats, which back solberg on fiscal matters, have rejected the offer.

" an uzbek dissident who was detained this week on return from exile has been charged with two public security crimes that each carry a possible five year sentence, news website gazeta.uz quoted police as saying on thursday. nurulloh muhammad raufkhon, the first prominent dissident to return to uzbekistan since the death of its long time leader islam karimov, was detained on arrival on wednesday, raising questions about the new president s efforts to change the country s image. doniyor tashkhojayev, deputy chief of tashkent police, told local media raufkhon had been charged in absentia and put on a wanted list after a criminal investigation launched in may. the charges include making public calls for unconstitutional change of the state order and producing and disseminating materials containing threat to public security and public order. each is punishable by up to five years in prison. the interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment. raufkhon was in exile in turkey after publishing in the spring of 2016 a book critical of karimov who had run the former soviet republic with an iron fist since 1989.     the authorities then raided raufkhon s house and put him on a blacklist of potential extremists and dissidents, which forced him to stay abroad. karimov died last september and his successor, shavkat mirziyoyev, last month ordered the removal of 16,000 people, including raufkhon, from the blacklist, as part of a broader liberalisation campaign. but raufkhon s detention and possible conviction could indicate that uzbekistan s powerful security apparatus is putting limits on such reforms. according to privately owned gazeta.uz, deputy chief of police tashkhojayev said police would investigate raufkhon s case and also see if his alleged crimes could fall within the scope of an amnesty.

" a u.s. appeals court on tuesday postponed a deadline for prosecutors in new jersey to reveal a list of unindicted co conspirators in the so called “bridgegate” criminal case involving allies of governor chris christie. the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals granted a last minute emergency request from one of the people on the list, less than two hours before u.s. prosecutors were set to file the names in federal court in new jersey. the document could make clear how many christie associates were aware of an alleged scheme to close down lanes at the george washington bridge in what prosecutors claim was an act of political retribution against a local mayor. christie, a republican who ran unsuccessfully for his party’s presidential nomination this year, has denied knowledge of the plot. u.s. district judge susan wigenton had ordered the list made public at the request of several media companies. but one of the alleged co conspirators anonymously filed an emergency appeal, arguing his reputation will be irreparably besmirched. in a brief order, the 3rd circuit in philadelphia scheduled a hearing for june 6. the court is also considering whether that hearing should be closed to the public, presumably to preserve the individual’s anonymity.     the unindicted co conspirators are those who prosecutors believe joined in the plot but have not been criminally charged. bruce rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, said in an email, “we’re looking forward to making our case before the full 3rd circuit panel that the public has a first amendment right to see the list of unindicted co conspirators.” thus far, three people have been charged. william baroni, the former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, and bridget kelly, christie’s former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in september. david wildstein, also a former official at the port authority, the agency that oversees major transportation facilities in the new york city area, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. prosecutors say they orchestrated the september 2013 lane closure in fort lee, new jersey, as payback against the democratic mayor for refusing to endorse christie’s re election bid. the ensuing traffic wreaked havoc in town, causing massive delays and impeding emergency responders. the case has proven embarrassing for christie, who is heading presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump’s transition team. the trial will unfold in the heat of the presidential campaign ahead of election day, nov. 8.",0
" temporary workers and foreign students previously drawn to new zealand on the promise of gaining residency will start leaving en masse, migration agents say, as the incoming coalition government promises to cut record migration. the tie up between the traditionally center left labour party and nationalist new zealand first represents an abrupt shift in the formerly open door policy that fueled strong economic growth but has also been blamed for soaring house prices and growing inequality.  we are told (foreign) students are working as many hours as possible to make as much quick money as possible on the understanding there is no more path to residency, and they will need to return home,  said connor brady, immigration adviser and manager director at agency new life global. new zealand had almost 122,000 international students in 2016, up 40 percent from three years earlier, led by china and india.  new zealand has developed a particularly close economic relationship with china, signing the oecd s first free trade deal with beijing in 2008 and welcoming record chinese investment and immigration in recent years. but prime minister elect jacinda ardern and her coalition partner winston peters have found common ground in  fortress new zealand  type policies that align more with the populist movements across europe and the united states than labour s free market predecessors and the outgoing national party government.    while the coalition government is still being formed and policy detail worked out, the 37 year old leader made clear she intends to stick with a promised reduction in migration and restrictions on foreign ownership of houses. labour is planning to cut net immigration by up to 30,000 from the current level of just over 70,000 a year. it also plans to renegotiate certain trade deals to accommodate for a planned ban on foreign ownership of existing homes. there may also be changes to the treatment of large foreign purchases, part of a chinese led investment spree that has helped propel the country during a period of otherwise subdued global growth.  it s almost 2020 and you want to take us back to 1980,   marcus beveridge, principal at immigration and foreign investment focused queen city law said of the proposals. the sept. 23 election thrust the country into political limbo for almost a month with neither national or labour winning enough seats to form a majority. holding the balance of power, nz first formed a coalition with labour on thursday, while the greens have offered  confidence and supply . labour and nz first campaigned on similar housing policy platforms that included banning foreign investors buying new zealand homes, introducing measures to dissuade people from quickly buying and selling properties, and increasing housing stock. jane lu, head of australia and new zealand for international property portal juwai.com, said there would likely be a rush of foreign property investment to beat any new rules. a similar trend emerged in vancouver and sydney when new taxes and restrictions were about to be introduced.  they could cause buyers to front load activity they already plan for next year,  said lu.  one premium buyer in sydney closed his transaction 15 minutes to midnight before the new regime kicked in.  new zealand s housing crunch has pushed prices up more than 50 percent nationally in the last decade and in auckland they have almost doubled, placing housing affordable at the center of the recent election campaign. it s unclear what the immediate impact on house prices will be, as there has already been a pullback in foreign investment in new zealand property from its frothy highs.  at this stage what we know is that the new government has indicated that they will ban foreign purchase of existing houses. whether there are further restrictions beyond that, there is a lot of uncertainty,  said christina leung, principal economist at the new zealand institute of economic research.  but i would say that at the moment, it s more the uncertainty itself over what new protectionist measures will be put in place which would weigh on demand for housing.  the election result caps a remarkable rise for ardern, who only took over the party s top job in august with polls then predicting a resounding victory for the nationals.  and while the sweeping policy changes are yet to be introduced, the new zealand dollar has already reacted, with the kiwi dropping to five month lows on friday.

" u.s. basketball legend dennis rodman said on wednesday he had skied and sung karaoke with his friend north korea s leader kim jong un and would like to  straighten things out  amid a nuclear standoff with the united states. rodman has paid several visits to kim in the isolated state but the two rarely discuss politics, the retired national basketball association star told british tv show  good morning britain.  north korea has carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests and u.s. president donald trump has responded with warnings of a  massive  military response.  for me to go over there and see (kim) as much as i have, i basically hang out with him all the time. we laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together. we ride horses, we hang out, we go skiing, we hardly ever talk politics and that s the good thing,  rodman said, according to a transcript. the basketball ace expressed admiration for trump but said the u.s. president could be  a little bit crazy sometimes .  rodman last visited north korea in june and earlier trips stoked talk that he could facilitate a breakthrough between pyongyang and washington, although his comments on kim have also drawn ridicule. north korea has long ignored warnings from the west and from its lone major ally, china, to halt its nuclear and missile tests which it conducts in defiance of u.n. security council resolutions. rodman said he was not trying to defend the actions of kim and was  just an ambassador for sports.  he said the relationship between the u.s. and russia had changed  but for some reason we have a big issue with north korea.    i don t love (kim). i just want to try to straighten things out for everyone to get along together.  rodman, nicknamed  the worm  during his playing career and known for his flamboyant character, is considered one of the best defensive players and rebounders in nba history.

" libya s u.n. backed government said on thursday it was investigating reports of african migrants being sold as slaves and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. footage broadcast by cnn appearing to show african migrants being traded in libya sparked an international outcry and protests in europe and africa.  there have been direct instructions issued to form an investigative committee so as to uncover the truth and to capture the wrongdoers, and those responsible, and put them before the judiciary,  libyan interior minister aref al khodja told journalists in tripoli.  we are now currently waiting for the results of the investigations which i believe are coming to a close.  the cnn video showed what it said was an auction of men offered to libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400, appearing to confirm earlier reports of the existence of markets for trading migrants in libya. many libyans reacted with anger to the outcry, with some pointing to a european push to stop migrants from crossing the mediterranean to italy that activists say has resulted in a worsening of conditions for migrants inside libya.    we call on local and international bodies to cooperate with the attorney general s office and provide any information that helps to reveal the truth,  the u.n. backed government s presidency said in a statement.    we, in libya, are victims of illegal migration and we are not a source for it,  it added, appealing to foreign powers to help stop flows from migrants  countries of origin and across libya s southern borders. the u.n. libya mission said on wednesday it was  actively pursuing the matter with the libyan authorities to set up transparent monitoring mechanism that safeguards migrants against horrific human rights abuses . under pressure from italy, the u.n. backed government has co opted local groups and tried to bolster libya s coastguard to stem the record flows of migrants crossing the mediterranean since 2014. though sea arrivals to italy are down almost a third this year, this week was marked by a surge in rescues after several days of bad weather, and one body was recovered, italy s coast guard and humanitarian groups said. on wednesday, 1,100 migrants were rescued from 11 boats, the coast guard said, and more than 200 were picked up on thursday.

" italy s upper house senate approved on thursday a new electoral system that is expected to handicap the anti establishment 5 star movement at a forthcoming national election and favor mainstream political blocs. the bill has already been approved by the lower house thanks to a battery of confidence motions that swept aside all opposition and now only needs a green light from the head of state to become law. this is expected in the coming days. the voting system, a mix of proportional representation and first past the post, will benefit parties that form pre election coalitions   something the 5 star has always ruled out. with opinion polls pointing to a three way split between the centre left, centre right and 5 star, analysts say the new electoral law will not produce a clear cut winner at the next election, which is due by may 2018. italy has had 64 governments since the end of world war two, including five in the past seven years, and a renewed bout of political instability in the euro zone s third largest economy could hurt global financial markets. to prevent a financial backlash, analysts say some form of grand coalition between the more moderate parties on the left and right is likely to emerge from any ballot box stalemate.  you are all the same. you don t have any ideas or any policies, just the same mission: to keep hold of your seats and continue to squeeze the country dry,  the 5 star senate leader, giovanni endrissi, told the upper chamber on thursday. polls show the 5 star is currently the most popular party in italy, with support at around 30 percent nationally. president sergio mattarella had called on parliament to draw up a new law to harmonize the existing voting rules that risked throwing up different results in the two houses.  all previous attempts at reform fell foul of political infighting but, unexpectedly, the ruling democratic party (pd) of former prime minister matteo renzi struck a deal with silvio berlusconi s forza italia party over a revised voting system. the rightist northern league also backed the initiative.  this law is the fruit of delicate mediation between coalition and opposition parties, which are very different parties with very different interests,  said luigi zanda, pd senate leader. this will be italy s third electoral law since 1993 and gives political leaders the power to pack electoral lists with supporters, potentially stifling internal party debate. the first past the post element will benefit parties that have a strong local base, notably the northern league, which looks set to win a large majority of seats in the wealthy north. under the new system, ixe pollsters predicted on thursday that a centre right bloc made up of forza italia, the northern league and brothers of italy party would win 269 of the 630 seats up for grabs in the lower house.  renzi s pd allied with a small centrist party would take 180 seats and 5 star 153 seats. a small bloc of leftist parties that have rebelled against renzi, would take 20 seats, ixe said. approval of the electoral law leaves parliament with one final task to complete before the houses can be dissolved   the reading of the 2018 budget. that legislation is expected to be passed by christmas, which could open the way for national elections as early as march.

" brazilian federal judge s rgio moro on monday said the car wash probe, brazil s largest ever corruption investigation, is nearing completion in the southern city of curitiba, where it started in 2014.   there are still investigations under way, but a large part of the work has been done,  moro told reporters in sao paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from u.s. based notre dame university for his work leading the probe. brazil s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in curitiba, when investigators went to a local car wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers. from there it spread to several state controlled companies, politicians, parties and private engineering groups. but curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation.     moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe, but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded. he also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year s election, despite the huge popularity he gained among brazilians. some pollsters such as datafolha have included moro s name in some early surveys.  they are losing their time, because this is not going to happen. simple as that , he said, adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so. despite the prospect of work related to the car wash investigation to end in curitiba, moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in brasilia, where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the supreme court.

" president emmanuel macron wants to scrap rules allowing some state rail workers to retire on a full pension up to 10 years before most other french workers. the reform plan risks inflaming tensions with labor unions who led the biggest strikes of recent decades in 1995 against a similar proposal that the government of the time floated before abandoning it and losing power. macron has said his government will embark on overhauling france s myriad pension schemes in early 2018, creating a single system for all.  the shake up of the pension scheme tailored for the sncf state rail group would affect nearly 200,000 employees, in particular train drivers who can retire as early as age 52, a decade before the pension age of 62. macron first outlined the idea in an internal sncf publication in july. he said he wanted a draft legislation presented early in 2018 and a reform that would be effective by mid 2018 or early 2019. asked about the president s plan for the sncf s pensions on wednesday, government spokesman christophe castaner said it fell within the wider pension reform package.   that s the track the president wants to take,  castaner told a weekly news briefing.  macron, a 39 year old former investment banker, was elected on a promise to push through far reaching social and economic reforms, a program that has drawn increasing public opposition since he took office four months ago.  his government last thursday presented plans to ease labor regulations with only one of the three biggest unions threatening protests. but tougher tests may lie ahead, including overhauling employment insurance this autumn and then pension reforms. in 1995, plans to abolish a pension scheme specific to sncf workers sparked the biggest wave of street protests and public transport strikes in recent french history. those protests, including a three week rail strike, ultimately led to the reform being abandoned, the resignation of then prime minister alain juppe and an election where voters replaced the right wing government with a socialist one in 1997. macron said on the campaign trail he wanted to smooth out the big differences between the pensions of state and private sector employees, while keeping the pension age at 62.  beyond the sncf, that will mean reforming the generous pensions of big state owned companies such as utility edf, whose unions have fiercely defended their privileges.

" just hours before president donald trump’s revised travel ban was set to go into effect, a u.s. federal judge in hawaii on wednesday issued an emergency halt to the order’s implementation.  the action was the latest legal blow to the administration’s efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly muslim countries, which the president has said is needed for national security. trump lashed out at the judge’s ruling, saying it “makes us look weak.”  trump signed the new ban on march 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a january executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a washington judge stopped its enforcement in february. u.s. district judge derrick watson put an emergency stop to the new order in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of hawaii, which argued that the order discriminated against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution.  judge watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention islam by name, “a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.” watson was appointed to the bench by former democratic president barack obama.     speaking at a rally in nashville, trump called his revised executive order a “watered down version” of his first. “i think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what i wanted to do in the first place,” trump said. trump called the judge’s block “unprecedented judicial overreach” and said he will take the case “as far as it needs to go,” including to the u.s. supreme court.  the department of justice called the ruling “flawed both in reasoning and in scope,” adding that the president has broad authority in national security matters. “the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts,” it said a statement.     the nation’s highest court is currently split 4 4 between liberals and conservatives with trump’s pick   appeals court judge neil gorsuch   still awaiting confirmation.  paul ryan, the republican speaker of the u.s. house of representatives, said the ban was needed to improve vetting of people entering the united states in order to prevent attacks and said he had no doubt that it would be upheld by higher courts.  watson’s order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard. he set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended. trump’s first travel order was more sweeping than the second revised order. like the current one, it barred citizens of iran, libya, syria, somalia, sudan and yemen from entering the country for 90 days, but it also included iraq, which was subsequently taken off the list.  refugees were blocked from entering the country for 120 days in both orders, but an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria was dropped in the new one. the revised ban also excluded legal permanent residents and existing visa holders. it provided a series of waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the united states. hawaii and other opponents of the ban claimed that the motivation behind it was trump’s campaign promise of “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” the government, in its court filings cautioned the court against looking for secret motives in the executive order and against performing “judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter’s heart of heart.”   watson said he did not need to do that, because evidence of motive could be found in the president’s public statements. he said he did not give credence to the government’s argument that the order was not anti muslim because it targeted only a small percentage of muslim majority countries.  “the notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,” the judge wrote.  the case was one of several moving through u.s. courts on wednesday that were brought by states’ attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups. in maryland, refugee resettlement agencies represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center argued in court for a restraining order.  in washington state, a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant visas asked u.s. district judge james robart in seattle   who suspended the first ban   to stop the new order. robart was appointed to the bench by republican former president george w. bush. both judge robart and u.s. district judge theodore chuang in maryland said they would issue written rulings in their cases, but did not specify a time line. washington state, joined by california, maryland, massachusetts, new york and oregon, said in court filings they supported the plaintiffs in seattle. if more judges side with watson, the government’s case may be harder to make at higher courts. the 9th circuit u.s. court of appeals upheld robart’s ruling against the first ban and watson referenced that decision in his order. various groups and companies said they would be harmed by the travel restrictions. a group of 58 technology companies, including airbnb inc, lyft inc and dropbox inc, filed a “friend of the court” brief in the case saying the order hurt their ability to recruit the best talent from around the world.  a longer list of companies, including apple inc , facebook inc  and alphabet inc’s  google   filed a brief opposing the first ban in a different court challenge brought by washington state, which is ongoing. it was not immediately clear why fewer tech companies signed on to the brief this time around.

" co host of msnbc’s “morning joe” and former republican u.s. congressman joe scarborough said on tuesday that he is leaving the republican party and becoming an independent during an appearance on a late night talk show. scarborough and his co host, mika brzezinski, appeared on “late show with stephen colbert” where he explained that his decision stemmed from his opposition to republican president donald trump and his party’s unwillingness to speak out against the president and his policies.  “my party has betrayed their core values,” he told colbert. “time and time and time again they turned the other way. they are doing the same thing now. it’s actually disgusting.” scarborough and brzezinski, who are engaged, were embroiled in public argument with the republican president two weeks ago. after trump levied personal attacks against brzezinski in a series of messages on social network twitter, the pair responded with a searing opinion piece in the washington post that questioned his mental health. trump beat democrat hillary clinton last november in the most divisive presidential election in modern u.s. politics, in which a gulf between republicans and democrats has widened and  hardened over ideological positions on social and economic issues.

" a bid by u.s. president donald trump to deport non mexican illegal migrants to mexico that has enraged mexicans will top the agenda when officials from both countries meet on thursday amid a deepening rift between the two nations. the u.s. government on tuesday said it would seek to deport many illegal immigrants to mexico if they entered the united states from there, regardless of their nationality, prompting a fiery response from mexican officials. calling the measure “unilateral” and “unprecedented,” mexican foreign minister luis videgaray said new immigration guidelines would top the agenda of meetings in mexico city with u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and homeland security secretary john kelly. the stakes are high for the united states, since mexico has warned that a breakdown in relations could affect its extensive cooperation on the fight against narcotics and on stemming the flow of central american migrants that reach the u.s. border  talking points from a senior official show mexicans plan to seek more information on trump’s executive orders at the summit. officials plan to say, “we are worried about the consequences that these can have for mexican nationals,” in the united states, the notes show. as part of its response, videgaray said mexico’s foreign ministry would get involved in legal cases in the united states where it considered the rights of mexicans had been violated. “the mexican government will take all the measures legally possible to defend the human rights of mexicans abroad, especially in the united states,” videgaray said.  the visit, which will include meetings with mexican president enrique pena nieto, as well as military, finance and interior officials, is supposed to focus on border security, law enforcement and trade, according to the state department.   but hopes for a thawing in relations are low, after a series of botched meetings last month deepened tensions between the historic allies.  “the relationship... is at such a historic low that it would be wishful thinking to assume that new concrete agenda items to advance [it] will come at this point,” jason marczak, director of the atlantic council’s latin america economic growth initiative said.  pena nieto abruptly canceled a planned january summit with trump after the real estate mogul suggested the mexican leader should not come if he refused to pay for a border wall.  and trump signed his first executive orders to punish sanctuary cities and build the wall, which could cost around $21.6 billion, the first time videgaray traveled to washington to negotiate with counterparts last month. trump has also threatened to rip up a key trade deal between the united states and mexico if he cannot renegotiate it to favor american interests.  the tuesday guidance also calls for the hiring of 15,000 more immigration agents, while subjecting immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to “expedited removal.”  in the past the united states has struggled to fill vacancies thanks to rigorous vetting requirements.

" u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he supported efforts to quickly act on legislation to impose new sanctions on russia and iran that passed the senate nearly unanimously but has stalled in the house. republican representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, “has indicated he wants to get moving on this quickly, and we want to honor that,” ryan said at his weekly news conference. the countering iran’s destabilizing activities act, which also includes new sanctions against russia, passed the senate 98 2 last week, a vote that looked like it might complicate president donald trump’s desire for warmer relations with moscow. the measure must pass the house before it can be sent to trump to sign into law or veto. the house parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the house, something known as a “blue slip” violation. democrats said they were skeptical about the explanation, noting that previous “blue slip” issues had been resolved in a matter of minutes. kevin brady, the republican chairman of the house ways and means committee, told reporters he had sent the senate a solution clearing the way for it to take the bill back, change it and move it forward. ben cardin, ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, told reuters the change did not appear to substantively alter the legislation and that staff was reviewing it to determine how to move ahead. senior senate democratic aides said any bill involving sanctions or fines could be interpreted as affecting u.s. revenues. trump’s fellow republicans hold a larger majority in the house than in the senate. some lawmakers and congressional aides said the white house was concerned about a provision that would require trump to obtain congress’ approval before easing any sanctions on russia. secretary of state rex tillerson urged congress last week to ensure that any sanctions package would give trump the flexibility to adjust sanctions. white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration would not take a position before the bill advanced through the house. however, he acknowledged the white house needed to work with congress on some areas of the measure. ryan said he did not yet know if it would go through the formal markup debate and amendment process. democrats have said that process could delay the bill for months. asked if he supported the policy in the bill, ryan said he supported sanctions.

" when former reality television contestant summer zervos accused donald trump of sexual misconduct last fall, she pursued her claims solely in the court of public opinion, since the allegations dated too far back to allow a lawsuit. but last month, she found a fresh approach to fight the former host of “the apprentice,” who has vehemently denied her allegations that he groped her in 2007. by professing his innocence, the man who is now president of the united states had effectively called her a liar, servos alleges in a defamation lawsuit. the suit copied a rare legal tactic employed most notably by several women who have accused the actor and comedian bill cosby of sexual assault: using his denials as the basis for a defamation claim. it is not uncommon for high profile allegations against celebrities to prompt defamation lawsuits, but they are usually filed by the star against the accuser. in 2014, however, joseph cammarata, the attorney for cosby accuser tamara green, realized he could adapt that strategy for his own purposes after cosby’s lawyer issued a statement calling the allegations “fantastical.” like many other cosby accusers, green was unable to sue for assault because the alleged incident occurred decades ago. “a direct claim for the assault is not available, so i came up with the idea that a defamation claim would be the appropriate vehicle to use to address the underlying harm,” said cammarata, whose lawsuit now includes seven cosby accusers as plaintiffs. all told, 10 cosby accusers filed four defamation lawsuits in three states. in simple terms, the argument is that trump and cosby have effectively branded the women as liars by denying the incidents occurred. but the women face a difficult challenge in making their cases, experts say. “merely saying, ‘i didn’t do it,’ is traditionally not seen in defamation law as calling your accuser a liar, even though logically that’s what it means,” said rod smolla, dean of the delaware law school and a first amendment scholar.  “but if you go beyond that – if you go from, ‘i didn’t do it,’ to, ‘she’s a liar,’ now you have arguably made a statement of fact” that could be subject to liability, he added. trump’s status as president does not shield him from civil liability for actions he took prior to assuming office. in a statement on tuesday, the attorney defending trump in the zervos lawsuit, marc kasowitz, said he and trump’s personal lawyer would soon file a response to the lawsuit. “president trump continues to deny any allegation of wrongdoing raised in said complaint,” he said. cosby, 79, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from approximately 50 women, has also denied any wrongdoing. the cosby and trump plaintiffs are taking on a tough double burden, experts said. first, the only way to show the denials by both men are untrue is to prove the incidents took place as described. “the burden is going to be on her to show that trump is actually saying something that’s false,” clay calvert, a first amendment expert at the university of florida, said of zervos. in addition, the women must show trump and crosby crossed the line into defamation by deliberately making false statements that seriously harmed the accusers’ reputations. in defamation cases, courts typically examine statements to determine whether they were factual or opinion, as expressing an opinion is generally protected by the first amendment. making that distinction can be challenging. in the cosby cases, for instance, judges have split on whether the lawsuits should proceed, even coming to opposite conclusions regarding the same statement from his attorney. u.s. district judge mark mastroianni in massachusetts rejected cosby’s attempts to have two cases, including green’s lawsuit, thrown out. in his rulings, the judge found that a november 2014 statement from cosby’s lawyer calling the allegations “unsubstantiated, fantastical stories” could be reasonably seen as factual, and therefore potentially defamatory. by contrast, a pittsburgh federal judge, arthur schwab, tossed a similar case against cosby, finding that the same statement was “pure opinion” and thus protected. unlike cosby, who has been fairly circumspect in his public statements, trump has aggressively attacked his accusers, calling the claims “100 percent fabricated and made up.” his rhetoric could make him more vulnerable to a defamation claim, experts said. trump has said he never met zervos at a hotel, despite her allegation that he groped her at a hotel in beverly hills, california. that type of specific fact based assertion can also make it easier to show defamation if it can be proven false, according to eugene volokh, a law professor at the university of california in los angeles. “so much depends on the particular statement and the particular context surrounding that statement,” he said.

" the u.s. environmental protection agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on wednesday in the trump administration’s latest move to reduce regulations. oil interest groups, including the american petroleum institute and the texas oil and gas association, had petitioned the epa a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  the epa said in a statement that it would delay the rule’s june 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. under democratic president barack obama, the epa released the first methane limits on the facilities in may 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  scott pruitt, the epa chief in the administration of republican president donald trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil producing oklahoma. pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  michelle robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists, said epa was favoring industry over science. “instead of looking backwards to review well reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,” and extend methane limits, she said.  wednesday’s move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the trump administration in march halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. in late march, trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  pruitt said the epa is continuing to follow through with trump’s order. “american businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,” he said.

" not enough effort is being put into teaching china s ethnic minorities standardized mandarin chinese during beijing s fight to eradicate poverty, a top advisor to the government said on saturday. chinese president xi jinping has declared war on poverty, and instructed local governments to eliminate impoverishment to create a  moderately well off society  by the beginning of 2021, in time for centenary of the ruling communist party. while regional authorities have dolled out supportive policies, funds and programs in china s poorest regions, they are failing to teach ethnicities enough mandarin, zhu weiqun, said in an article in the state backed global times newspaper. efforts to teach minority peoples mandarin are  not up to scratch  in various places, said zhu, who is head of the minorities and religions committee of the chinese people s political consultative conference, an advisory body.  i regularly come across low level cadres who with great effort use a mouthful of dialect to talk about their poverty alleviation plans without realizing that dealing with their own deficiencies in speaking mandarin is an urgent task,  he said. china promotes the use of standardized mandarin, based on the dialect of beijing, and encourages ethnic minorities to learn the official language in a bid to improve unity in multi ethnic areas of the country. but there has been resistance to the push for standardization in regions such as tibet and xinjiang, where tibetans and uighurs, a turkic speaking mostly muslim minority, often consider language integral to their cultural identity. beijing denies that mandarin promotion damages minority culture, arguing that learning the official language gives minorities greater opportunities for work and schooling. zhu said in the article that communication issues with workers from xinjiang could cause a  vicious cycle  when companies group the workers together hindering their ability to work with others. over 70 percent of the population speaks mandarin, but there levels of fluency in west china are 20 percent lower than in the east, with only 40 percent of people able to speak mandarin in some rural areas, zhu said.  using standardized mandarin to alleviate poverty, using poverty alleviation to promote standardized mandarin, does not only have an economic importance, but also has a deep political importance,  he said.

" president donald trump had personal liabilities of at least $315.6 million to german, u.s. and other lenders as of mid 2017, according to a federal financial disclosure form released late on friday by the u.s. office of government ethics. he had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the white house last september. revenues also increased at mar a lago, the florida resort known as the “winter white house.” trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0zm) the 98 page disclosure document posted on the ethics office’s  website showed liabilities for trump of at least $130 million to deutsche bank trust company americas [dbkgk.ul], a unit of german based deutsche bank ag. for example, trump disclosed a liability to deutsche exceeding $50 million for the old post office, a historic washington property where he has opened a hotel.  trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to ladder capital corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in new york, los angeles and boca raton, florida. the largest component of trump’s income was $115.9 million listed as golf resort related revenues from trump national doral in miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. revenue from trump corporation, his real estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from mar a lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. the private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after trump’s election. he earned $11 million from the miss universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.  revenue from television shows like “the apprentice” fell to $1.1 million, down from $6 million a year earlier. his assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. the document showed trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming u.s. president. his tenure in most of those posts ended on jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. most of the entities involved were based in the united states, with a handful in scotland, ireland, canada, brazil, bermuda and elsewhere. trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. but he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family’s income, assets and liabilities. “president trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,” the white house said in a statement, adding that the form was “certified by the office of government ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.” an office of government ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. trump released a disclosure form in may 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. some critics disputed that figure as overblown. before taking office in january, trump was a new york real estate developer and television celebrity.

" guam posted emergency guidelines on friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack after a threat from north korea to fire missiles in the vicinity of the u.s. pacific territory. pyongyang’s state run kcna news agency said on thursday its army would complete plans in mid august to fire four intermediate range missiles over japan to land near guam as north korea and the united states engaged in increasingly heated rhetoric this week over the north’s nuclear weapons program.  north korea did not threaten guam with a nuclear attack, but the crisis between pyongyang and the united states has stirred fears that a nuclear conflict could break out in the region. while the governor of guam shrugged off the north’s missile warning and said there was no heightened threat, the government has issued a preparedness fact sheet. in language that evoked the specter of nuclear conflict during the cold war, the guidelines cover what to do before, during and after a nuclear attack.  “do not look at the flash or fireball – it can blind you,” it said. “take cover behind anything that might offer protection.”  “remove your clothing to keep radioactive material from spreading. removing the outer layer of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive material,” read the guidelines of what to do if caught outside.  they suggest having an emergency plan and supply kit and making a list of potential concrete structures near home, work and school to serve as fallout shelters. “fallout shelters do not need to be specifically constructed for protecting against fallout,” it said. “they can be protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough (i.e. concrete) to absorb radiation given off by fallout particles.” the fact sheet advises people on how to wash: do not scrub or scratch the skin, use soap, shampoo and water but do not put not conditioner on your hair because it binds radioactive material. it offers advice for parents who are away from their children during a strike.  “stay where you are, even if you are separated from your family,” it said. “listen to the news. do not call the school. be patient. wait for instructions to pick up your child.” the information on the fact sheet was gathered from the u.s. department of homeland security website www.ready.gov, a guam homeland security spokeswoman told the pacific daily news. guam is home to about 163,000 people and a u.s. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a coast guard group.

" the white house said on saturday it had ordered that iran, venezuela and four african nations be added to a u.s. list of countries accused of failing to crack down on human trafficking, a step that further isolates them from the united states.  the white house said it also was increasing restrictions on north korea, eritrea, russia and syria, which already were on the list, by constraining them from engaging in educational or cultural exchange programs with the united states. in addition, president donald trump’s administration instructed the u.s. executive director of the international monetary fund and u.s. executive directors at other multilateral development banks to vote against extending loans or other funds to north korea, russia and iran for fiscal year 2018, which begins on sunday. under a 2000 u.s. law called the trafficking victims protection act, the united states does not provide non humanitarian, non trade related foreign assistance to any country that fails to comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and is not making efforts to do so. the white house said in a notice that iran, venezuela, the democratic republic of the congo (drc), equatorial guinea, south sudan and sudan had been added to the list of countries subject to these restrictions for the new fiscal year. the move came six days after trump included venezuela and iran on a list of eight countries targeted for travel restrictions to the united states. the restrictions on venezuela focused on government officials who the trump administration blamed for the country’s slide into economic disarray. the travel ban on iranians was broader. that travel ban list lifted previous restrictions on citizens from sudan.

" anthony scaramucci, a hedge fund founder who was a fundraiser in donald trump’s election campaign, will join the president elect’s white house staff as an advisor and public liaison to government agencies and businesses, he said on friday. scaramucci, founder of skybridge capital hedge fund and a former employee at goldman sachs(gs.n), is a member of trump’s transition team. he will work as a liaison in the white house for state and local governments and for both american and foreign businesses, scaramucci told reporters in new york. “one of my other personal goals though is to get all of the american people to see president trump the way i see him,” he added. trump, a republican, takes office on jan. 20. scaramucci played down media reports from thursday that he would hold a position analogous to that currently held by valerie jarrett, who oversees the white house’s offices of public engagement and intergovernmental affairs and is seen as one of president barack obama’s most powerful advisers.  “that’s probably an overstatement,” scaramucci said when asked about the comparison. “valerie and i know each other quite well and i will be speaking to her later in the day. i don’t want to overstate the position.” scaramucci did not discuss what would happen to skybridge, which had $12 billion in assets under management or advisement as of nov. 30, 2016, down from $12.9 billion as of dec. 31, 2015, according to firm’s website. the firm was put up for auction as scaramucci began considering a potential position in the white house, reuters reported last month.

" the u.s. senate on tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the house of representatives. by a vote of 68 29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely senate approval this week. two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the senate. meanwhile, the white house threatened to veto a $622.1 million zika bill poised to pass the house of representatives later this week, saying it was “woefully inadequate.” unlike the senate legislation, the house bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. many conservative republicans in the house refuse to approve zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while democrats and some senate republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. republican senator roy blunt from missouri told reporters that the senate measure “trimmed this package back (from obama’s request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time.” democratic senator patty murray from washington, who crafted the legislation with blunt, added, “we are going to need to keep the pressure on house republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need.” it was unclear how long it might take the senate and house to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. u.s. health officials have concluded that zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. the world health organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that zika can also cause guillain barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. last year, brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern u.s. states including florida. house republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the obama administration already shifted to zika from unused funds to battle ebola, would provide enough money through sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. the administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine.

" the chinese and russian militaries will next month hold anti missile drills in beijing, china s defence ministry said on friday, amid concern in both countries about the deployment of a u.s. anti missile system in south korea. china and russia have both expressed opposition to the basing of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defence (thaad) system in south korea, which seoul and washington say is needed to defend against the threat of north korean missiles. china, along with russia, has repeatedly expressed opposition to the thaad deployment, saying it will do nothing to help ease tension with north korea. china also fears thaad s powerful radar system can look deep into is territory, undermining its security.  china s defence ministry said in a statement a computer drill would take place from dec. 11 to dec. 16. the aim of the exercise was to jointly practice defense against missiles and how to handle  sudden and provocative attacks on the two countries  territories by ballistic missiles and cruise missiles , the ministry said.  the drill is not aimed at any third party,  it said, without elaborating. while china and south korea agreed last month to move beyond their year long stand off over thaad, a dispute that has been devastating to south korean businesses that rely on chinese consumers, china has stuck to its opposition to the system. china and russia have close military and diplomatic ties, and they have repeatedly called for a peaceful, negotiated solution to the north korea nuclear and missile crisis.

" president donald trump is likely to pick federal reserve governor jerome powell as the next head of the u.s. central bank, a source familiar with the matter said on monday, prompting investors to push down yields on treasury notes.    the republican president, who is considering powell, current fed chair janet yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on thursday, a white house official said separately. by picking powell, a soft spoken centrist and fed governor since 2012, trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the yellen run fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years. powell, 64, has supported yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. “powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in washington. he’s the kind of guy who can get through senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said john silva, chief economist at wells fargo. the main challenger to powell is stanford university economist john taylor, a favorite of conservative republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates. taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. his rule implies they should be higher than they are now. critics say that a taylor run fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession.  the race for the fed job has shifted between yellen, who was nominated by former president barack obama to a one year term in 2014, powell and taylor in recent weeks. financial markets had pushed treasury yields higher on talk taylor would get the job. benchmark 10 year treasury notes us10yt=rr were yielding 2.37 percent in mid afternoon trading on monday, down from 2.43 percent on friday. the fed, which is holding a two day policy meeting this week, has lifted rates twice this year and is expected to do so again in december.

" a former vietnamese official who germany says was kidnapped in berlin to face charges in hanoi over financial losses at a state construction firm had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government, according to documents seen by reuters. the decision to re open the case and aggressively pursue prosecution shows the tougher stance taken by the ruling communist party since vietnam s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex prime minister nguyen tan dung lost out.  the party says it wants to tackle corruption but some critics have accused vietnam s rulers of embarking on a witch hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. the internal crackdown drew global attention last month when germany accused hanoi of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh, a former official with state oil firm petrovietnam. he was accused of financial mismanagement that caused losses of $150 million at petrovietnam construction (pvc) during the time he served as chairman from 2009 to 2013. but according to a letter dated may 18, 2015 from then trade minister vu huy hoang to then prime minister dung, the official had stated his responsibility but the government had not  found negative signs  relating to his actions.  therefore, authorized agencies and units agreed not to take disciplinary action over thanh,  it said, noting that he had moved to a role at the trade ministry, where he had worked hard to try to resolve the problems at petrovietnam construction.  corrective work and post inspection handling of pvc were done effectively and in accordance with the prime minister s requirements,  the letter said. responding to questions about the letter and whether there would be further prosecutions over the case, foreign ministry spokeswoman le thi thu hang said the party and state were resolute in dealing with corruption or lawbreaking by any organization or individual.  based on the results of the investigation, the functional agencies shall strictly handle those who violate the law in accordance with the provisions of vietnamese law,  she told reuters. reuters was unable to contact thanh, former trade minister hoang or former prime minister dung either directly or through government offices. thanh ran petrovietnam construction, a subsidiary of a sprawling state enterprise that is also involved in everything from oil and gas to power generation, ship building and insurance. after his return to vietnam, thanh was shown on state television saying that he had decided to surrender himself in order to face justice. the government has not said how he returned home. thanh was a relatively junior figure among those who are under investigation in relation to petrovietnam s dealings as well as in the banking sector. the most senior political casualty so far is dinh la thang, a former petrovietnam chairman who was sacked from his role in the politburo. a vice minister who had been responsible for appointing thanh has also been sacked. hoang has also been symbolically stripped of his title of former trade minister for violating state and party rules. investigations continue into petrovietnam and the trade ministry which oversaw it as well as into the central bank. there are widespread expectations that more members of dung s administration will be prosecuted. dung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of communist party general secretary, vietnam s most powerful position. the post remained in the hands of nguyen phu trong, whose modest public profile contrasts with the conspicuous wealth that some members of dung s administration displayed.  fighting and preventing corruption, waste and negativity are no longer handled slowly and case by case. it has become a movement,  trong said in july. according to a survey by transparency international conducted between july 2015 and january 2017, vietnam had become the most bribery prone country in asia after india and a majority of vietnamese believed corruption had worsened.

" a thai court sentenced a 62 year old man to 27 years in prison on wednesday for planting a bomb at a bangkok hospital that wounded 21 people. the explosion hit the phramongkutklao hospital in the thai capital, bangkok, in may on the third anniversary of a 2014 military coup. the hospital is popular with soldiers and their families and retired military officers.  police arrested watana pumret, a retired government employee, after the blast and said he had confessed to the bombing because he despises the military.  from the evidence we believe the accused committed the offence ... the accused confessed to it,  a judge said. courts in thailand often do not identify the names of judges, with the exception of some high profile legal cases. watana was seen crying after the verdict. he hugged his wife and refused to answer reporters  questions, according to a reuters reporter at the court. reuters was unable to contact watana s lawyer after the verdict. thailand s military launched a coup in may 2014 after months of street protests that took a toll on southeast asia s second biggest economy. the military promised to unite the politically divided country and restore stability but it has been accused by critics of not wanting to relinquish power. the military government has promised to hold a general election in november 2018 to return thailand to democracy but senior government figures have said more time was needed to complete laws related to the vote. the government has also cited security concerns as a reason for not lifting a ban on politics that has been in place since 2014, despite increasing pressure from groups of all political stripes to lift the ban.

" amnesty international urged egyptian authorities on tuesday to release 24 nubian activists detained last week on charges of protesting without permission as they rallied for resettlement on the banks of the nile river. for half a century, egypt s nubians have lobbied the government in cairo for a return to their homelands on the banks of the upper nile, desperate to reclaim territory their ancestors first cultivated 3,000 years ago.  egyptian authorities have long since marginalized nubians, ignoring their demands to return to their historical lands and treating nubian activism as suspicious on security grounds,  amnesty international s north africa campaigns director najia bounaim said in a statement.  instead of flagrantly flouting nubians  rights to freedom of expression and assembly by continuing to detain them over their peaceful protest, the authorities must release these 24 activists from custody immediately.  according to the statement, the activists had not marched far before they were surrounded and beaten by security officers. the activists  lawyer, mohamed abdel salam, told reuters last week they were also charged with incitement of protests and disrupting public safety.

" when president donald trump scolded u.s. lawmakers on thursday for clamping down on moscow with new sanctions, his message clashed with the one that vice president mike pence pushed during a four day trip this week to eastern europe. as he toured estonia, georgia and montenegro, pence said the sanctions passed overwhelmingly by congress would send a unified message to russia that it must change its behavior. trump, by contrast, took to twitter to complain that the sanctions legislation, which he grudgingly signed, would send u.s. russia relations to “an all time & very dangerous low.” while some republicans played down the divergence, critics said it exemplified an incoherent policy that would unsettle allies and fail to placate moscow. “there are some policies where a good cop/bad approach can work,” said michael mcfaul, a u.s. ambassador to russia under former democratic president barack obama. but mcfaul added that in the case of the trump administration’s policy toward russia, moscow was likely to view the mixed signals as a sign of policy disarray. if the republican president continues to want improved relations with russia, “he’s not achieving his goal,” mcfaul said. the white house’s two track approach is mirrored in moscow.  after trump signed the new sanctions into law on wednesday, russian prime minister dmitry medvedev, the no. 2 in the russian ruling hierarchy, launched a blistering attack on the white house. yet russian president vladimir putin — who has tried to cultivate a personal rapport with trump in phone conversations and face to face meetings at a summit in germany — has not uttered a word in public about the sanctions since trump approved them. trump has repeatedly said he wants better ties with russia. but the country has loomed large over the first six months of his administration as a special counsel and u.s. congressional panels investigate allegations moscow meddled in the 2016 u.s. election to help trump and also examine any potential role by trump aides. moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign.     after congress passed the sanctions legislation with a large enough margin to override a presidential veto, trump signed it on wednesday but criticized it as infringing on his authority and said he could make “far better deals” with governments than congress could. as a countermeasure to the sanctions, putin called for reducing the staff of the u.s. diplomatic mission by 755 people and for the seizure of two properties near moscow used by american diplomats. jarrod agen, deputy chief of staff to pence, insisted that trump and pence were “completely aligned” on russia. “it was the president’s decision to send the vice president to the region. it was the president’s decision to deliver the message that the vice president delivered,” agen told reuters. he added that pence and trump spoke every day during his trip and sometimes multiple times a day. the disconnect between pence and trump on russia is an anomaly. pence usually goes to lengths to emphasize his loyalty to his boss and to downplay any differences. their different tone on russia dates back to the u.s. presidential campaign. while trump often praised putin, pence called the russian president a “small and bullying leader” during a vice presidential debate last october. during his trip this week, pence condemned russia for its “occupation of georgia’s soil” as he spoke to u.s. and georgian troops engaged in joint exercises only 40 miles (64 km) away from russian troops in south ossetia. in montenegro, pence accused russia of trying to “destabilize” the western balkans   a message criticized by moscow. russia’s foreign ministry said it was “regrettable to note that washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the cold war era, which is completely detached from reality.” traditional republican conservatives   who favor a hard line on moscow   have taken some comfort in pence’s message, as have foreign leaders concerned about the impact of a rapprochement between trump and putin. “what he (pence) is saying is good and helpful and should be the policy of the trump administration – and so for those of us who want it to be that way, we’re happy to embrace it,” said danielle pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the american enterprise institute. “none of us know what donald trump thinks in his heart of hearts about russia,” pletka said. but she added: “if (trump) were not comfortable with pence making this trip, pence would not be making this trip.” republican bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said he would not “read a lot” into the different tones struck by pence and trump, although he welcomed pence’s trip to the european countries. corker described pence as the administration’s “ombudsman” on policy and said defense secretary jim mattis, secretary of state rex tillerson and trump’s national security adviser, h.r. mcmaster, were key to developing trump’s foreign policy. a former u.s. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was at pains to explain the disconnect between pence and trump on russia. “we are dealing with a major, open split between the president and basically the rest of his administration with the possible exception of tillerson,” the former official said.

" republican donald trump on tuesday night called democrats the “party of slavery” and praised what he called the millions of african americans with career success, as he tries to revamp his outreach to minority voters. trump has made much maligned efforts to appeal to black and hispanic voters, groups that generally support democrats and are expected to vote heavily for hillary clinton in the nov. 8 election. “the republican party is the party of abraham lincoln,” trump said at a rally in everett, washington.  “it is the democratic party that is the party of slavery, the party of jim crow and the party of opposition,” he said, referring to racial segregation laws that once existed in the american south. the republican nominee has said democrats failed minority voters with economic policies that have not improved their job prospects, but his attempts have been criticized for painting a bleak view of the lives of all black and hispanic americans. clinton last week released an ad mocking trump’s attempts to reach those groups and showing headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the new york real estate mogul faced in the 1970s. a prominent supporter of trump’s apologized on tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of clinton in blackface. trump sought to correct course in washington state on tuesday, saying millions of black americans “have succeeded greatly” in art, science, sports and other endeavors. “but we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities,” he said.  ",0
" slovenia would be a good place for a first meeting with u.s. president donald trump, russia’s vladimir putin said on friday, but he said the choice of venue would not be moscow’s alone.  putin made the comments after slovenian president borut pahor offered ljubljana, his country’s capital, as a venue for a meeting between the russian and u.s. leaders who have not met since trump’s inauguration last month.  trump and putin have both said they would like to try to mend battered u.s. russia ties, which fell to their lowest level since the cold war after russia’s 2014 annexation of ukraine’s crimea.  putin made it clear that no date for such a meeting had yet been agreed, but said he was keen to try to restore russian u.s. relations in full. “as regards ljubljana, slovenia in general, it is of course a brilliant place to have a dialogue of such a sort. but it doesn’t depend only on us, it depends on a whole series of circumstances,” putin told reporters after meeting pahor in moscow. “if these meetings ever happen, we don’t have anything against ljubljana,” putin said. european union member state slovenia was the venue for the first meeting between george w. bush and putin in 2001 where the then american leader made what became a famous comment about looking putin in the eye and getting “a sense of his soul.”  it is also where melania trump, the u.s. president’s wife, grew up. the kremlin sees slovenia as an ally in its quest to end western sanctions over the ukraine conflict.  russia was a big export market for slovenian food products before the ukraine crisis, and slovenia remains keen to be a transit country for russian gas supplies to southern europe.

" the final death toll from the fire that destroyed the grenfell tower social housing block in london in june is 71, police said on thursday after five months of painstaking search and recovery operations. police had previously said about 80 people died in the blaze, which tore through the 24 storey tower in west london in the middle of the night, but officers now believe all those who died in the fire have been recovered and identified. the figure has come down because some people were reported missing several times, some people who lived in the tower and were feared dead were found to have been elsewhere on the night, and some people were falsely reported dead by fraudsters hoping to receive financial compensation. the final toll includes 70 adults and children who died in the tower during the fire, and one baby who was stillborn shortly after the heavily pregnant mother escaped from the 21st floor, suffering severe smoke inhalation on her way down. the mother survived.  specialist teams working inside grenfell tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people,  said metropolitan police commander stuart cundy, who is in charge of operations at the tower.  i know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible. they have done that for every person who lost their life, their families and loved ones, and all those for whom grenfell tower was home.  the tower was home to a tight knit, multi ethnic community in a deprived social housing estate within the wealthy kensington and chelsea borough that is also home to large numbers of millionaires. the tragedy has prompted political debate and soul searching about london s stark social inequalities and whether neglect of social housing estates and the communities living in them played a part in the fire. a criminal investigation is under way that could result in individuals or organizations being charged. a separate public inquiry aims to shed light on any flaws or irregularities in the design, construction or maintenance of the tower. cundy said that when he first entered grenfell tower after the fire, the devastation was such that he feared it would not be possible to find, recover and identify all those who died. police officers, assisted by forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and specialists in using dental science to identify unknown human remains, searched every flat on every floor and every communal area. the search involved sifting through tonnes of debris by hand to identify all human remains in the charred building. in parallel, huge amounts of investigative work was undertaken to identify who was in grenfell tower on the night of the fire, who was missing and presumed dead, enquire after those reported missing and reconcile all the information. one person was reported missing 46 separate times. some were reported under a number of different names, and even the slightest differences in spelling had to be investigated. police said that having completed all this work, they now believed it was highly unlikely that anyone remained in grenfell tower.

"   creditors of puerto rico’s government development bank on wednesday withdrew a lawsuit that sought to prevent a run on the bank ahead of a $422 million debt payment due on may 1. hedge funds including brigade capital management and claren road asset management, which hold some of gdb’s $3.75 billion in debt, said in a statement that the lawsuit had no purpose now that puerto rico governor alejandro garcia padilla has declared a fiscal emergency at the bank. the emergency declaration, issued on saturday, prevents gdb from lending and paying certain debts, and blocks depositors from withdrawing any money not required to fund essential services. this is essentially what the creditors had sought in their lawsuit, which was filed four days before garcia padilla’s declaration. puerto rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, and a shrinking population, all of which threaten to collapse its economy. gdb owes creditors $422 million on may 1, a payment garcia padilla has said it cannot afford. the emergency declaration aimed to keep money in the bank while the bank negotiates a restructuring with creditors. while the u.s. territory has missed some minor debt payments in the last year, a default at gdb   the primary liquidity source for the island’s public entities   would be by far the most significant. default would also likely push the bank into receivership.  efforts to avoid that fate parallel a push by federal lawmakers to find a legislative solution to puerto rico’s debt.

" the head of the u.s. internal revenue service should resign due to the agency’s inability to improve its defenses against hacks on taxpayer data, a republican lawmaker said on friday. republican representative barbara comstock said new leadership is needed to replace irs commissioner john koskinen due to failures to secure americans’ sensitive information from malicious intrusions, escalating a line of attack from republicans who frequently criticize the federal tax collection service. “commissioner koskinen has provided little confidence that cyber security is a top priority at the irs,” comstock said in a statement shared with reuters, adding she was concerned the agency apparently has no one in charge of cyber security. the irs did not immediately comment. more than 700,000 individuals may have had their personal information pilfered by hackers during an intrusion last year, the irs announced in february. that number has been repeatedly revised upward from initial estimates that were far smaller. comstock, in her statement, cited a government accountability office report released last month that found the irs struggling to upgrade its information security plan. the irs agreed to work toward implementing dozens of outlined recommendations. koskinen appeared before congressional committees this week and said complying with the gao recommendations was a priority. the commissioner has been under near constant fire from republicans since he took over the agency in 2013 amid controversy over whether the irs was targeting conservative groups.  more than 60 republicans have signed on to a resolution introduced in october to impeach koskinen on charges that he has impeded a congressional investigation into the irs’s treatment of conservative groups. comstock is the first lawmaker to call for koskinen’s resignation solely for cyber security reasons, an aide said. koskinen is not the first obama administration official to be targeted by congress for his handling of cyber security. last year katherine archuleta, head of the office of personnel management, resigned after several lawmakers from both parties called for her ouster following the theft of personal data of more than 21 million individuals. comstock said friday that koskinen should follow the lead of archuleta and other top executives who have left due to poor handling of hacks “to allow for new and trusted leadership at the irs.” ",0
"obama is clearly attempting to strip americans of our right to express our opinions on social issues based on our religion or morals. americans have found themselves in a scary place, where we are remaining silent when we know we should be speaking out, because we re afraid of being shamed by the progressive left. meanwhile the left continues to blur the lines of morality, hoping that they will erase all individual thought and speech.in a communist society, the individual s best interests are indistinguishable from the society s best interest. thus, the idea of an individual freedom is incompatible with a communist ideology. the only reason to hold individual speech and information rights would be to better the society. some of us care little about the debate over public bathrooms. we do, however, care about the ongoing destruction of federalism, individual choice, and good-faith debate.one reliable way to quash dissent and force moral codes on others is to liken your cause to that of the civil rights fight. every liberal issue is situated somewhere on the great historical arc of  equality  and  justice.  if a person stands against even one of these causes which were once great but are increasingly trivial they have, according to the cultural imperialists of the obama administration, aligned themselves with the klan. literally.after u.s. attorney general loretta lynch announced that the department of justice had filed a federal lawsuit to stop north carolina from passing a  controversial law this is the go-to characterization of conservative bills that pass with healthy majorities requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their birth certificate, she had this to say:this is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. we saw it in the jim crow laws that followed the emancipation proclamation; we saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to brown v. board of education; and we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions that were intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian americans might one day be afforded the right to marry.likening a spat over biologically segregated boy/girl bathrooms to the genuine, violent, systematic, state-sponsored, society-wide bigotry that took place in this country for a century is both intellectually and morally corrupt. it s not all a continuum. yet this administration peddles these kinds of risible comparisons in the cause of self-aggrandizement all the time. hans fiene has coined it selma envy.the present situation is significantly different, and in every possible sense less dire. it is the sort of social problem generally worked out amongst people in this country without unelected civil rights commissions punishing business owners for thought crimes. under north carolina s law no one was stopping a private company or coffee shop or big box store from having any kind of bathroom set-up they desire. i m pretty sure most voters don t comprehend this fact when they hear the distorted coverage of these laws in the news.north carolina and other states have preemptively moved forward with these kinds to bills to head off the state redefining gender. too late. the fact is that the federal government can simply announce that a man can be a woman and vice versa if they choose. it then compels everyone in country to accept this reality. yet there is no government definition of what transgendered means, other self-identification, which can mean anything.  civil rights  division chief vanita gupta says:  transgender men are men.   transgender women are women.  so sayeth vanita gupta, so sayeth we all. or else. and now 300 million people have adhere to the obama administration s relativistic notions about nature and gender.now, from what i can gather the central anxiety of many people is not that the transgendered will take advantage of their children, but that any man can simply declare himself a woman, put on a wig, and go into a public bathroom. maybe it s an irrational fear, maybe it s not. as a father who s had to send young daughters into busy public bathrooms, i know one thing for sure: i could not care less what vanita gupta has to say on the topic.in a broader sense, the suit is symbolic of the federal government s eight-year crusade to decimate any semblance of federalism and streamline progressive morality. the administration ignores state laws that conflict with federal policy when it approves and it sues states when it does not. states that pass law enforcement bills president obama finds unsatisfactory will see the full force of the justice department come down on them. those with drug legalization laws and immigration laws he does like, even if they conflict with federal law, have nothing to worry about. whether one agrees in theory with these moves and i am liberal on drug legalization and immigration allowing washington to selectively enforce law conflicts with the kind of republicanism that allows us to be diverse and deal with unique problems locally.for entire story: the federalist",1
" republican lawmakers told the top u.s. securities regulator on tuesday they are concerned her agency will rush out new rules in the final weeks that president barack obama, a democrat, holds the oval office. the chair of the house financial services committee, jeb hensarling, who has been mentioned as a possible treasury secretary under republican president elect donald trump, said “whenever there is a transfer of power from one presidential administration to another, there is a temptation for federal agencies to rush pending rulemakings to completion, as a way of cementing the policy priorities of the outgoing administration.” “i would strongly urge you to respect the results of last week’s election and resist the temptation to finalize any regulations, including dodd frank ... regulations,” added hensarling during a hearing on the securities and exchange commission. sec chair mary jo white was the hearing’s sole witness. on monday she announced she will leave her post when obama’s term ends in january, a decision made before trump’s stunning election win. she told the committee firmly there would be no surprise rulemakings or ramming pending rules through to completion.  “i don’t see any last minute rushes. i do intend to carry out the agenda i outlined in february 2016 as much as i can,” she said. “i don’t think any rulemaking benefits from it being rushed. it’s hard to do it right,” she also said.  nonetheless, white would not commit when asked about a proposed multi agency rule for clawing back compensation from executives who have committed wrongdoing. the sec and fellow major financial regulators must approve the rule for it to become final, and the lawmakers pressed white to not bring it up for a commission vote while she is still chair.  white said she could not predict what will happen in the next 2 1/2 months, or what will be included in the final draft of the rule. to continue carrying out its agenda announced earlier this year, the sec will focus on capital segregation rules, an outstanding derivatives rule, and a staff recommendation on mutual fund disclosure, white said. the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform law is considered one of obama’s signature domestic achievements, and federal agencies have furiously put in place new regulations and systems to carry out its many moving parts. trump has said he would repeal parts of the law, and he is expected to use legislation hensarling drafted as a blueprint for his plans. only half a dozen democrats attended tuesday’s hearing, primarily asking about corporate board diversity and the wells fargo ghost account scandal, or blasting trump. white, an independent, has been criticized by both parties. democrat senator elizabeth warren recently called on obama to fire her, and progressives say she slowed down implementing dodd frank.  white said the sec has completed 80 percent of the rulemakings required by dodd frank. she added that she would not want to see parts of the law, including the volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments, rescinded in the future.

" u.s. president elect donald trump has delayed until january an announcement originally set for this week on how he plans to step back from running his business empire to avoid conflicts of interest, his spokesman said on monday. among trump’s holdings are hotels and golf resorts from panama to scotland, besides a winery and modeling agency. legal experts say the only way he could entirely avoid conflicts of interest would be to sell his global holdings. last month trump said he would hold a news conference on thursday to spell out how he would separate himself “in total” from his worldwide business holdings.  “the announcement will be in january,” trump spokesman sean spicer said on monday, without giving any reason. the republican president elect has not held a news conference since winning the nov. 8 election. after trump’s victory, his company, the trump organization, said it was looking at new business structures with the goal of transferring control to donald trump jr., ivanka trump and eric trump, three of his children who are involved with the company. in a series of messages on social network twitter, trump said he would leave his businesses before taking office on jan. 20, to focus on the presidency. “two of my children, don and eric, plus executives, will manage them,” trump tweeted late on monday. “no new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.” the messages did not mention a role for ivanka trump in the businesses. trump added that he would hold a news conference in the “near future” to discuss business matters, his cabinet picks and other topics.     in a series of tweets last month, trump said, “legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.” he did not say what the planned change might mean for ownership of his businesses.

" after well received responses to two major hurricanes that hit the u.s. mainland, president donald trump is battling to show americans he can handle yet another natural disaster   this time in puerto rico   despite being caught up in another twitter war.     caught off guard by the severity of hurricane maria’s damage to the u.s. island territory, trump did not focus on the storm for days, instead launching a barrage of tweets over his view that national football league players should be required to stand during the u.s. national anthem. trump insisted to reporters on tuesday that he was not preoccupied with the nfl controversy and that he could multi task. he said he would visit puerto rico on tuesday. “i have plenty of time on my hands. all i do is work,” he said. but with the territory’s 3.4 million people struggling to get food, water, power and shelter, democratic leaders in congress and some puerto rico residents, who are u.s. citizens, accused the trump administration of being more sluggish in its response than to disasters on the u.s. mainland. the previous republican president, george w. bush, faced widespread criticism for his administration’s initial handling of hurricane katrina, which killed some 1,800 people in and around new orleans in 2005. as of tuesday, trump had tweeted two dozen times about the nfl controversy and only began tweeting about puerto rico when he started to draw criticism. in tweets on monday night, he said puerto rico was in “deep trouble” and noted its massive debt crisis. “trump certainly seemed to be on top of the situation with hurricane harvey in houston and hurricane irma in florida. with puerto rico, because of this distraction, there is maybe the perception that he hasn’t been on top of the situation,” said presidential historian thomas alan schwartz. when trump finally started talking about puerto rico, he gave mixed signals, saying on the one hand that puerto rico was in trouble, while lauding his administration’s response on the other. “i just question the victory laps that the president is taking already,” said lars anderson, who was a senior federal emergency management agency official in democratic president barack obama’s administration, and now runs a crisis communications firm called bluedot strategies. trump will have the opportunity next week during his visit to puerto rico to use the presidential bully pulpit to draw attention to the need for more resources, anderson said. “i’m glad to see that the white house is actually acknowledging the situation there,” he said. the white house stepped up its efforts to show trump in charge of the crisis, organizing a meeting of major cabinet officials to go over the federal response to puerto rico. an official photo of the meeting in the situation room showed trump at the head of a long table, getting briefed on the crisis. after it ended, acting homeland security secretary elaine duke and brock long, head of the fema, briefed reporters on the federal response. “the response to date has been phenomenal,” duke said. on tuesday night, puerto rico governor ricardo rossello said he was satisfied with the administration’s relief efforts and called trump’s performance “excellent.” u.s. officials stressed that the federal disaster system kicked into gear days ago to provide food, water and rolled sheeting for roofs. the u.s. military was increasing its flights bearing emergency aid to 10 per hour, an official said. trump supporters said people may be expecting too much from a federal response for an island territory whose electrical grid and infrastructure were already in poor shape before maria came blowing through. “there is no way to be prepared to rebuild an island with 3 million people on it in three months. it’s beyond anybody’s capability to do so,” said barry bennett, a former trump campaign adviser. trump’s use of twitter to fan controversy has been one area that his control minded white house chief of staff, john kelly, has been unable to tamp down. privately, aides said there was  likely not much kelly could do about it. “nobody can get him off twitter,” said one administration official.

" britain s cambridge university press has rejected a request from its chinese state owned importer to block online access in china to scholarly articles from the american political science review.  a request was indeed made by the chinese importer, but was not acted upon by cambridge university press, so no content was blocked,  a spokeswoman for cup said in an emailed statement. cup later clarified that the request had been made early last month. china s state council information office told reuters on friday that importers of foreign publications must verify that the products are legal. in august, cup, the publishing arm of the elite cambridge university, reversed a decision to block online access in china to several hundred articles and book reviews in the china quarterly, a leading academic journal on chinese affairs that has been published since the 1960s. it said it had blocked the articles, which covered sensitive topics including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests, the 1966 76 cultural revolution and tibet, in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in china. academics called the decision an affront to academic freedom.  the state council information office, responding by fax two weeks after a reuters request for comment, said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law.  all publications imported into china s market must adhere to chinese laws and regulations. publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications,  it said, without mentioning cup.

" u.s. president donald trump warned on tuesday he might terminate the nafta trade treaty with mexico and canada after three way talks failed to bridge deep differences. the united states, canada and mexico wrapped up their first round of talks on sunday to revamp the trade pact with little sign of a breakthrough coming. trump reopened negotiations of the 1994 treaty out of concern u.s. economic interests were suffering. “personally, i don’t think we can make a deal. i think we’ll probably end up terminating nafta at some point,” trump said at a political rally in phoenix, arizona. suggesting a termination might help jumpstart the negotiations, trump said: “i personally don’t think you can make a deal without a termination.” following trump’s remarks, mexican foreign minister luis videgaray tweeted: “no surprises: we’re already in a negotiation. mexico will remain at the table with serenity, firmness and with the national interest ahead.” in a joint statement issued at the end of five days of negotiations in washington, the top trade officials from the three countries said mexico would host the next round of talks from sept. 1 to 5. the talks will move to canada later in september, then return to the united states in october, with additional rounds planned for later this year.

" up to 300,000 rohingya muslims could flee violence in northwestern myanmar to neighboring bangladesh, a u.n. agency official said on wednesday, warning of a funding shortfall for emergency food supplies for the refugees. according to estimates issued by united nations workers in bangladesh s border region of cox s bazar, arrivals since the latest bloodshed started 12 days ago have already reached 146,000. numbers are difficult to establish with any certainty due to the turmoil as rohingya escape operations by myanmar s military. however, the u.n. officials have raised their estimate of the total expected refugees from 120,000 to 300,000, said dipayan bhattacharyya, who is bangladesh spokesman for the world food programme.   they are coming in nutritionally deprived, they have been cut off from a normal flow of food for possibly more than a month,  he told reuters.  they were definitely visibly hungry, traumatized.   the surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities which are already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in myanmar. many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food. bhattacharyya said the refugees were now arriving by boat as well as crossing the land border at numerous points. another u.n. worker in the area cautioned that the estimates were not  hard science , given the chaos and lack of access to the area on the myanmar side where the military is still conducting its  clearance operation . the source added that the 300,000 number was probably toward the worst case scenario.  the latest violence began when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. the ensuing clashes and a military counter offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to bangladesh. in a letter to the u.n. security council on tuesday, secretary general antonio guterres expressed concern that the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe . based on the prediction that 300,000 could arrive, the wfp calculated that it would need $13.3 million in additional funding to provide high energy biscuits and basic rice rations for four months. bhattacharyya called for donors to meet the shortfall urgently.  if they don t come forward now, we may see that these people would be fighting for food among themselves, the crime rate would go up, violence against women and on children would go up,  he said.

" the u.s. agency that could bring civil charges against donald trump, jr. if it found he violated campaign finance laws by meeting with a russian who purportedly had damaging information on hillary clinton is often gridlocked by partisan politics and can take years to mete out punishment, legal experts said on wednesday.  some democratic lawmakers want the federal election commission to charge trump jr. based on emails in which he eagerly agreed to meet with a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer with damaging information about democratic presidential candidate clinton.  they argue that his enthusiasm was akin to seeking something of “value” from a foreigner, which is prohibited under u.s. campaign laws.  democrat u.s. representative grace meng wrote to the federal election commission on wednesday asking it to take up a complaint against trump jr. that was filed this week by government watchdog group common cause.  the group asked the agency to investigate and said there was “a troubling pattern of president trump, members of his family and key advisors acting as if they are above the law.”      judith ingram, a spokeswoman for the federal election committee, said any complaints it received would be handled confidentially and she declined further comment.    larry noble, a former general counsel for the federal election commission who now is senior director of the campaign legal center said he thinks complaints about trump jr. have merit and that the agency should investigate. noble said if the commission rejected or ignored the complaints, outside groups could sue it to try to force an investigation.  the department of justice could file criminal charges if there was evidence of wrongdoing by trump jr., but such decisions would be left to special counsel robert mueller, who is investigating  possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.     the federal election commission consists of six commissioners, traditionally three republicans and three democrats, but vacancies have left just one democrat, an independent and three republicans.  to begin an investigation against trump jr., four of the commissioners would need to consent. if any of the republicans declined to consent the group would be gridlocked. former federal election commission chair ann ravel has been a vocal critic of the agency, writing in a report earlier this year that it was “deadlocked” by partisan division. she cited the agency’s refusal to investigate secretly owned shell corporations contributing millions to political groups known as super pacs, thereby making it impossible to determine the source of the cash. she noted that in 2006 commissioners were deadlocked in  2.9 percent of substantive votes in matters under review that were closed that year. in 2016, the commissioners deadlocked in 30 percent of all substantive votes taken in such matters. in 2006, she wrote, the commission assessed more than $5.5 million in civil monetary penalties for matters under review. in 2016, it imposed a total of $595,425 in civil monetary penalties for matters under review.  in an opinion piece for the new york times in february, she wrote, “what we are left with is an agency mandated to ensure transparency and disclosure that is actually working to keep the public in the dark.” paul s. ryan, a lawyer with common cause who filed the complaint against trump jr., acknowledged that the agency’s enforcement power is “very weak.”     “our best hope ... is going to be robert mueller’s investigation,” he said.

" republican front runner donald trump warned on wednesday of riots if he is denied the party’s presidential nomination and  pulled the plug on a scheduled debate among candidates, raising the temperature even more in a heated white house race.     the outspoken new york businessman scored big wins in primaries in florida, illinois and north carolina on tuesday, bringing him closer to the 1,237 convention delegates he needs to win the nomination.  trump also claimed victory in missouri but lost the crucial state of ohio, and left the door open for those in the party trying to stop him from becoming the republican nominee for the nov. 8 election.  trump might fall short of the majority of delegates required, enabling the party’s establishment to put forward another name at the july convention in cleveland to formally pick its candidate. in an interview with cnn on wednesday, trump said the party could not deny him the nomination should he fail to win enough delegates. “i don’t think you can say that we don’t get it automatically. i think you’d have riots. i think you’d have riots. i’m representing many, many millions of people.”      while the republicans were mired deeper in turmoil, hillary clinton won victories in at least four states on tuesday that put her in good shape to defeat senator bernie sanders of vermont and win the democratic party’s nomination. republican party leaders are appalled at trump’s incendiary rhetoric and reject policies such as his vow to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily ban muslims from the united states and build a wall along the mexican border.     the party tried to play down his riot comments, only days after trump supporters and protesters clashed at a rally  for the republican in chicago that was later scrapped. “first of all, i assume he is speaking figuratively,” republican national committee spokesman sean spicer told cnn.     recent outbreaks of violence during protests at trump rallies have prompted president barack obama, a democrat, and mainstream republican figures to speak out against the billionaire.     david farber, a professor of modern american history at temple university in philadelphia, said that, though there have been many episodes of violent unrest at american political events, not least the 1968 democratic convention, trump’s warning of a riot is unprecedented. the nearest modern comparison would be former alabama governor george wallace, who unsuccessfully ran for president in 1968 as a third party candidate, farber said “we’re in a situation somewhat like the 1960s in the united states, a period of great polarization,” farber said, “and there just isn’t a lot of common ground, and trump supporters feel a lot of quiet desperation that trump is helping to fan the flames of.”    in comments likely to raise more concern in the republican establishment about trump’s lack of experience and temperament,  the former reality tv show host said he was for the most part his own foreign affairs adviser. “i’m speaking with myself, number one, because i have a very good brain,” he told msnbc’s “morning joe” show. “i know what i’m doing. ... my primary consultant is myself.”          trump’s closest national challenger is first term u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, who prides himself in being a grassroots conservative often at odds with republican leaders.     he too warned of severe reactions against an attempt to stage a so called brokered convention or contested convention to install a republican candidate supported by party leaders. “i think that would be an absolute disaster. i think the people would quite rightly revolt,” cruz told cnn.  a brokered convention is a complicated process of sequential votes that opens the way for horse trading.    the republican establishment’s bid to stop trump may have come too late as the field of candidates has dwindled to only three, with trump, 69, in command ahead of cruz, 45, and ohio governor john kasich, 63, who won his state’s republican primary on tuesday and is the last moderate republican presidential candidate standing. growing in confidence, trump pulled out of a republican debate scheduled for monday in utah, saying it clashed with a speech he plan to give to a pro israel group. debate hosts fox news then canceled the event.    senator marco rubio quit the white house race after defeat in his home state of florida. trump now needs to win about 55 percent of the roughly 1,100 delegates still up for grabs in state by state nominating contests to guarantee the nomination. it is not an insurmountable challenge.        republican strategist ron bonjean said it might be tough for the party to block trump at the convention. “a contested convention would be justified if trump only had around 35 or 40 percent of the delegates locked up. however, if he is very close to getting the majority of delegates, it would be politically difficult for the establishment to try stop him by backroom wheeling and dealing without risking a serious backlash from voters,” said bonjean. the strategist is not affiliated with any of the candidates. party figures are divided about whether to throw their weight behind trump despite his downsides or to go on trying to halt him. florida governor rick scott endorsed trump on wednesday but another influential southern governor, south carolina’s nikki haley, declared her support for cruz, the state’s post and courier newspaper said. the election season is likely to become more politicized after obama nominated judge merrick garland to the supreme court, setting up a showdown with senate republicans who have vowed to block any obama nominee.     on the democratic side, wins on tuesday for former secretary of state clinton, 68, gave her an almost insurmountable edge over sanders, 74. his campaign said it was not ruling out asking for a recount in tuesday’s tight missouri race. seeking to become the united states’ first woman president, clinton needs to win only around a third of the democratic delegates remaining to become her party’s nominee.

" u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson will meet nato foreign ministers at a rescheduled gathering on march 31, a senior state department official said on friday, ending a furor over his earlier decision to skip the event. reuters exclusively reported on monday that tillerson had decided not to attend his first meeting with the ministers, originally scheduled for april 5 6   raising fears about the new u.s. administration’s commitment to the military alliance. but the state department official said the meeting in brussels had been brought forward and would now go ahead. there was no official statement from nato. tillerson’s potential no show had increased unease caused by u.s. president donald trump’s description of nato as “obsolete” during his election campaign. trump has since said he strongly supports the alliance, but in interviews and speeches he continues to air grievances over what he see as europe’s failure to pay its fair share of protecting the west. tillerson met many of the nato foreign ministers in washington this week at a gathering of the coalition fighting islamic state militants, but the meeting in brussels would be his first formal nato ministerial. given the u.s. role as the de facto head of the alliance, it is rare for the united states’ top diplomat to miss a nato meeting. the last time was during the iraq war in 2003, when colin powell was forced to cancel at the last moment.  tillerson, a former top executive at exxon mobil corp who worked with the russian government, originally decided to attend a u.s. visit by the chinese president instead of the april nato meeting, reuters reported. “the secretary of state will visit nato in brussels on friday, march 31st. the visit will come after his trip to ankara, turkey. details about his schedule are forthcoming,” the state department official said on friday.

" democratic lawmakers pushed on tuesday for another chance to question wells fargo & co’s (wfc.n) leadership about sales practices after the scandal hit bank said it forced auto insurance on borrowers who did not need it. democrats on the senate banking committee asked its republican leaders in a letter to summon wells fargo chairman stephen sanger and chief executive tim sloan. that letter accompanied one sent by representative maxine waters, the top democrat on the house financial services committee, who wants to know how wells fargo wrongly charged roughly 570,000 customers for auto insurance they did not ask for or need, leading to unwarranted delinquencies and car repossessions. unwanted auto insurance is the latest wrinkle in a months long scandal over sales practices at wells fargo, where employees also created as many as 2.1 million deposit and credit card accounts in customers’ names without their permission. “members should have the opportunity to question mr. sloan about the bank’s progress in addressing the damage it did to its customers,” said the senate letter, signed by democrats including ranking member sherrod brown. a spokeswoman for wells fargo said the bank looked forward to answering questions from washington. “wells fargo understands and is committed to addressing policymaker concerns,” said jennifer dunn. “we are committed to fixing these mistakes and earning back trust.” employees have said they created unauthorized accounts to hit sales goals handed down by management. the creation of fake accounts and misplaced insurance charges went on for years before the bank’s management took action. after wells fargo reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over the fake accounts in september, its then chairman and ceo john stumpf appeared before both committees to face questions from lawmakers at heated hearings. he left the bank shortly after, to be replaced by sloan and sanger. whether stumpf’s successors will be hauled before congress publicly is uncertain. only republicans can summon witnesses, since that party controls congress. the senate letter urged idaho senator mike crapo, who chairs the banking panel, to call a wells fargo hearing in september. democrats want to know how the auto insurance and unauthorized accounts practices went on undetected, and wells fargo plans to compensate customers who were wrongly charged for insurance, according to the letter.

" ethnic koreans living in japan are nervously watching growing tensions over north korea and are wary of a possible backlash against their community as pyongyang ramps up its sabre rattling. while public antipathy towards koreans does not appear to have escalated in reaction to the north s latest nuclear test and missile launches, the community has been the target of abuse by japanese nationalists after similar incidents in the past. the north conducted its most powerful nuclear test ever last week, and in late august fired a ballistic missile over hokkaido in northern japan in a new show of force.     in the western japanese city of osaka   home to the country s largest population of ethnic koreans   few are willing to talk publicly about north korea, and those that do have mixed views on pyongyang s actions. pu kyon ja, owner of the store selling korean traditional clothes and a second generation korean resident in japan, said she felt the north s pursuit of nuclear weapons was a natural reaction against threats from the united states.  i can t say this loudly but i secretly think well done  on  north korea s development of missile and nuclear capabilities, she said. north korea is  under great pressure (from the international society), which i believe should end.   i m watching over the current situation with great hope,  she added. on the other hand, chung kap su, another second generation korean in the town, said he hopes north korea stops further provocations and pursues a peaceful path by seeking dialogue with south korea.  north korea can t defeat (the united states), so i hope it changes its way.  some 453,096 south koreans and 32,461 north koreans lived in japan last year, according to government data. many were forced to move there during japan s occupation of the korean peninsula before and during world war two. japan passed an anti hate law last year, which may be discouraging fresh acts of abuse against the community, but the issue still bears watching, said moon gyeong su, professor of ethnic korean studies at ritsumeikan university in kyoto.  when north korea launches missile or conducts nuclear tests, for example, korean schools have been an easy target for bullies and accusations (in japan),  he added.

" south africa s supreme court of appeal on friday upheld a high court ruling to reinstate nearly 800 corruption charges filed against jacob zuma before he became president. zuma, who has faced and denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office, said he was disappointed by the court s decision and asked the national prosecuting authority (npa) to  consider representations  before deciding whether to proceed against him. it was unclear when the npa would make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s. the ruling is likely to amplify calls for zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 and diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling african national congress (anc) chooses a new leader in december.  it is going to make it a lot more difficult for his camp to get their presidential candidate elected,  said gary van staden, political analyst with nkc african economics.     friday s unanimous supreme court ruling upheld a high court decision in april 2016 that the charges against zuma should be reinstated. they had been set aside in april 2009 by the then head of the prosecuting authority, paving the way for zuma to run for president later that year.  rejecting an appeal brought by zuma and the npa, judge lorimer leach said it was  irrational  for the npa to have set the charges aside   the same word used by the high court.  it is difficult to understand why the present regime at the npa considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended,  the supreme court s leach said. npa spokesman luvuyo mfaku said prosecutors would need to consider the judgment but would  at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice . in a separate statement, the npa said zuma s lawyers had asked the state prosecutor  not to serve an indictment on his client nor to re enrol the matter prior to the representations having been considered . the prospect that zuma s removal may be inching closer lifted the rand against the dollar. zuma is unpopular with many investors after sacking respected finance minister pravin gordhan in march, a move that hit south african financial assets and helped tip the country s credit ratings into  junk  territory.             zuma has faced persistent corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the gupta family may have used their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies. reuters has not independently verified the emails, and zuma and the guptas have consistently denied any wrongdoing. mmusi maimane, leader of the main opposition democratic alliance, said he would write to the national director of public prosecutions, shaun abrahams, to demand he indict zuma.  the charges have been formulated and the evidence is ready. we now await a trial date,  maimane told reporters. asked by reporters whether zuma should resign, the african national congress (anc) secretary general gwede mantashe said the party would allow that process to take its course.  the first thing is whether the npa will decide to charge the president,  he said.  you re putting the cart before the horse.  national prosecutor mokotedi mpshe s decision in 2009 to drop the 783 charges against zuma in what has become known as the spy tapes case was based on phone intercepts presented by zuma s legal team. they suggested the timing of the charges in late 2007 may have been part of a political plot to stop zuma, then deputy president, running for the top job. zuma was linked to the 1990s arms deal through his former financial adviser, who was jailed for corruption.  analysts said the credibility of zuma and the npa were in question after the ruling. one lawyer, ulrich roux, who speaks to media as a legal analyst, said  a private prosecution could be instituted  if charges are not brought.

" highlights of the day for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on wednesday: the republican chairman of the house of representatives intelligence committee says some of trump’s personal communications may have been caught up in “incidental” surveillance involving a foreign power in the months after the election. the main investigative panel of the house of representatives has asked the white house and the fbi for documents regarding former national security adviser michael flynn’s foreign contacts with russia, turkey and others, its republican chairman and democratic counterpart say. trump and republican congressional leaders appear to be losing the battle to gather enough support in the house of representatives to pass their obamacare rollback bill, watched by wary investors in financial markets. secretary of state rex tillerson, speaking at a meeting of countries fighting islamic state, says the united states will set up “interim zones of stability” to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against islamic state and al qaeda. u.s. led coalition aircraft drops fighters for the first time into an area near the syrian city of raqqa to retake territory from islamic state in a mission that includes artillery and special operations troops. supreme court nominee neil gorsuch says presidents must obey court orders and expresses uncertainty about language in the constitution barring u.s. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as democrats grill him on issues involving trump. labor secretary nominee r. alexander acosta tells a senate committee he will abide by trump’s directive to review a pending “fiduciary rule” for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. the senate foreign relations committee will meet with secretary of state rex tillerson to discuss the administration’s proposed budget, the panel’s chairman says, after heated opposition in congress to trump’s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. a new york state judge is ordering exxonmobil corp to work with new york’s attorney general to recover lost emails from an account used by tillerson when he was the oil company’s chief executive. the senate takes up a measure to repeal regulations adopted by the obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like alphabet inc’s google or facebook inc.

" a defense policy bill that president barack obama is expected to sign into law this month will give president elect donald trump greater influence over u.s. foreign broadcasting entities. the national defense authorization act passed by congress last week includes a provision abolishing the broadcasting board of governors, an independent body that oversees government backed media outlets such as the voice of america and radio free europe, and replaces it with a chief executive nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate. the election victory of republican businessman trump, who has had a stormy relationship with some media outlets he accuses of being biased against him, has raised concerns among some officials about whether the media outlets can maintain their editorial independence under a trump appointed ceo.it is not clear, however, if the change is intended to give the president greater influence over news, information and fact checking that u.s. government supported broadcasters send to russia, cuba, china and other authoritarian states, or whether it is simply an effort to make those efforts more effective. there has been support from both republicans and democrats for reorganizing the broadcasting operation to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.  a senior u.s. official familiar with the broadcasting agencies said he was not aware of the trump transition team making contact with the board of broadcasting governors and associated agencies. “we have no (concrete) indication that anything bad’s going to happen,” the official continued.   congressional aides familiar with the issue said they thought such concerns were overblown, noting that the chief executive must be confirmed by the senate and that the organization’s basic structure would remain in place, minus the nine member board. they said the reorganization plan was developed with input from members of both parties in congress, as well as democratic officials from the obama white house. however, some officials in the state department and the u.s. intelligence community have said they are worried that trump is not wary enough of russian president vladimir putin, who considers radio free europe/radio liberty’s efforts “to promote democratic values” an attempt to undermine his government. the board of governors would first be transitioned into an “international broadcasting advisory board” to advise the new ceo, but that also would be phased out.

" a new york state judge on wednesday ordered exxonmobil corp to work with new york’s attorney general to recover lost emails from an account once used by u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson when he was the oil company’s chief executive. justice barry ostrager of the state supreme court in manhattan also ordered exxon by march 31 to turn over documents from its management committee that had been subpoenaed by eric schneiderman, the attorney general. schneiderman had issued the subpoena in november, in connection with his probe into whether exxon misled investors and the public about climate change. at a court hearing on wednesday, a lawyer for the attorney general said exxon had just made a “bombshell” revelation that it had lost a year of emails from an account that tillerson had used, but under the alias “wayne tracker.”     tillerson used the alias account to send and receive information about climate change and other matters, schneiderman said in a march 13 letter to the court. schneiderman said exxon failed to disclose the “wayne tracker” account, and that it had been uncovered during the review of other materials. the letter also said exxon had produced 60 documents bearing the “wayne tracker” email, but had not said the account was tillerson’s. exxon responded that the account was proper, enabling tillerson to communicate easily with other exxon officials, and set up because of the flood of email that tillerson already received. it has also said it does not consider the lost emails significant, and that copies of many would already have been turned over to the attorney general. in december, tillerson left exxon, where he had also been chairman, and stepped down as chairman of the american petroleum institute trade group. the discovery of tillerson’s account came after disclosures that former secretary of state hillary clinton and current vice president mike pence, when he was indiana’s governor, had used previously undisclosed accounts to send and receive mail electronically.

" five iraqi passengers and one yemeni were barred from boarding an egyptair flight from cairo to new york on saturday after president donald trump halted the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries, sources at cairo airport said. the passengers, arriving in transit to cairo airport, were stopped and re directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  trump on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other muslim majority countries, saying the moves would help protect americans from terrorist attacks. he said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. “i’m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states of america. don’t want them here,” trump said earlier on friday at the pentagon. “we only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,” he said. the bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would be travelers with passports from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. besides cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by trump had swiftly implemented the ban. arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. the order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move trump separately said was aimed at helping christians in syria. that led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. one group said it would announce a court challenge on monday. the council on american islamic relations said the order targets muslims because of their faith, contravening the u.s. constitutional right to freedom of religion. “president trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of muslim countries under the banner of national security,” said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association.  trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the nov. 8 election. but people who work with muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. even legal permanent residents   people with “green cards” allowing them to live and work in the united states   were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to muslim advocates, a civil rights group in washington.  on friday evening, abed ayoub of the american arab anti discrimination committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the united states for medical care and others. “it’s chaos,” ayoub said. during his campaign, trump tapped into american fears about islamic state militants and the flood of migrants into europe from syria’s civil war, saying refugees could be a “trojan horse” that allowed attackers to enter the united states. in december 2015, he called for a ban on all muslims entering the united states, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the u.s. constitution. his idea later evolved into a proposal for “extreme vetting.”  trump’s order also suspends the syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network that the exception would help syrian christians fleeing the civil war there. legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. “if they are thinking about an exception for christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,” said stephen legomsky, a former chief counsel at u.s. citizenship and immigration services in the obama administration. but peter spiro, a professor at temple university beasley school of law, said trump’s action would likely be constitutional because the president and congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. “it’s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,” spiro said. the order may also affect special refugee programs for iraqis who worked for the u.s. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of iraq. it is already affecting refugees and their families, said jen smyers of the church world service, a protestant faith based group that works with migrants. smyers said she spoke to an iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in iraq due to processing delays. “those two 18 year old daughters won’t be able to join their mother in the u.s.,” she said. democrats on friday were quick to condemn trump’s order as un american, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the united states as a land that welcomes immigrants. “today’s executive order from president trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,” said democratic senator edward markey in a statement. some republicans praised the move. representative bob goodlatte, chairman of the house of representatives judiciary committee, said islamic state has threatened to use the u.s. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. “i am pleased that president trump is using the tools granted to him by congress and the power granted by the constitution to help keep america safe and ensure we know who is entering the united states,” goodlatte said in a statement. without naming trump, iranian president hassan rouhani said on saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. trump on wednesday ordered the construction of a u.s. mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. “today is not the time to erect walls between nations. they have forgotten that the berlin wall fell years ago,” rouhani said in a speech carried live on iranian state television. he made no direct reference to trump’s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly muslim states. rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed iran’s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. rouhani said earlier this month that trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was “meaningless”. france and germany voiced disquiet on saturday over trump’s new restrictions on immigration. “welcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,” french foreign minister jean marc ayrault said at a joint news conference with german counterpart sigmar gabriel. “the united states is a country where christian traditions have an important meaning. loving your neighbor is a major christian value, and that includes helping people,” said  gabriel. “i think that is what unites us in the west, and i think that is what we want to make clear to the americans.” ",0
" u.s. president elect donald trump said on friday mexico would repay the united states for his planned border wall, a day after news emerged that his transition team was exploring getting the republican led congress to vote to approve the funding. trump told the new york times he would most likely seek repayment through renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement, which groups the united states, mexico and canada. sean spicer, a spokesman for trump, said on friday the incoming administration would need government funding to build the wall and that trump said in october mexico’s payment would be a reimbursement. “the idea that we’re going through the appropriations process and figuring out how to pay for it shouldn’t be news,” he told a briefing, confirming earlier reports on the funding. trump’s promise to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border, and make mexico pay for it, was a major campaign theme and helped energize his supporters. the suggestion has infuriated mexican officials who have said they would never agree to pay for a wall. trump may face resistance in congress to the idea of the united states paying for the wall. some republican lawmakers worry about the high cost and question whether it is the best way to solve the complex issue of illegal migration. some conservative groups have called for a crackdown on benefits and jobs available to illegal migrants, which they say are a magnet for migration. republican representative luke messer told reporters on friday he had proposed legislation to get mexico to pay for the border wall by ending a child tax credit given to illegal immigrant parents, which he said cost $4.2 billion annually.  “if you close that loophole for two years, you could pay for the higher ticket cost,” messer said, referring to one estimate that a wall could cost $10 billion. cnn and other media organizations reported on friday trump’s transition team had signaled to congressional republicans that he preferred to fund the wall through congress as soon as april. in response, trump tweeted that the media was not reporting that mexico would repay money spent to build the wall. a ‘pay for the wall’ memo trump’s team issued in early 2016 proposed pressuring mexico by cutting off remittances from undocumented mexicans in the united states. it proposed amending the patriot act, passed after the sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen. “it’s an easy decision for mexico: make a one time payment of $5 10 billion to ensure that $24 billion (in remittances) continues to flow into their country year after year,” the memo said. “we have the leverage, so mexico will back down,” it said. mexican president enrique pena nieto’s office declined to comment on trump’s comments on friday. in august, pena nieto told trump mexico would not pay for a border wall. representative martha mcsally, the republican chair of the border and maritime security subcommittee, told reuters a 2006 law known as the “secure fence act” would give trump the authority he needs to extend fencing or build a wall. an internal report prepared by u.s. customs and border protection estimates initial costs for expanding border fencing would cost over $11.3 billion. building a wall would be more costly. trump has signaled since being elected that he would be open to fencing rather than a wall in some areas.  if funding was tied to a government funding bill, lawmakers could be forced to approve it to avoid a government shutdown. house appropriators have no interest in threatening a shutdown, spokeswoman jennifer hing said. “the (appropriations) committee has not received any request from the trump team or gop leadership on this issue. if and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,” she said. the mexican peso mxn=, which briefly weakened about 0.2 percent against the dollar following trump's tweet, fell to record lows this week as trump intensified criticism of businesses making goods in mexico rather than in the united states.

" a mexican presidential hopeful and governor of a wealthy border state said he would cut taxes to compete with lower rates in the united states if president donald trump s fiscal reform passes congress, hinting at a broader potential response in mexico. jaime rodriguez, the governor of nuevo leon who is seeking to become the first independent to take the presidency, said he would lower  many taxes  if successful.  we re going to compete,  he told reuters on monday.  if i make it and am able to be president, i would lower taxes,  he added, though he declined to give details. mexico s government has been watching trump s fiscal plans closely, and some senior officials and lawmakers say the country may have to cut taxes if the united states does. the u.s. senate approved a bill on saturday that could see corporation tax slashed to 20 percent from 35 percent, raising questions over whether this could make investment in mexico, where the corporate tax rate is 30 percent, less attractive. two years ago, rodriguez pulled off a surprise win with a social media led campaign and became the first independent governor of a mexican state. nuevo leon, home to the major industrial hub of monterrey, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the north american free trade agreement (nafta), which spurred an influx of investment from companies seeking access to u.s. consumers. that included a $1 billion investment from south korea s kia motors under a 2014 deal, although rodriguez and others were critical of the incentives the company received.  we don t want any more car assembly plants,  he said.  we won t give incentives like the ones we gave to kia to any other company, it s excessive.  trump has threatened to withdraw from nafta if he cannot rework it in favor of the united states. however, rodriguez, who in may 2016 predicted that trump would win the presidency, was adamant that nafta would survive.  it s not going to collapse,  he said. known in mexico as  el bronco  due to his blunt style, the 59 year old rodriguez leads aspiring independents to gather the 866,593 signatures needed by feb. 19 to get on the ballot for the july 1 election, according to statistics from electoral regulator ine. however, he has reached the threshold of 1 percent of voters in just three states, and the law requires getting that share in 17 states. polls so far suggest rodriguez is unlikely to mount a serious challenge for the presidency.

" in a wide ranging request for documents and analysis, president elect donald trump’s transition team asked the department of homeland security last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction.  the team also asked about the department’s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the obama administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. and it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.  don't miss: megyn kelly leaving fox news to join nbc reuters tv: trump fears grow in mexico valley where dollar is king the requests were made in a dec. 5 meeting between trump’s transition team and department of homeland security officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by reuters. the document offers a glimpse into the president elect’s strategy for securing the u.s. borders and reversing polices put in place by the obama administration.   trump’s transition team did not comment in response to reuters inquiries. a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security and u.s. customs and border protection declined to comment.       in response to the transition team request, u.s. customs and border protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the u.s. mexico border, and about the same distance along the u.s. canada border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by reuters.      reuters could not determine whether the trump team is considering a northern border barrier. during the campaign, trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the u.s. mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with canada.  one program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was operation phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 army national guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.  the program once deployed 6,000 airmen under president george w. bush but was downsized by barack obama, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.        the transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since obama took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.      trump has said he intends to undo obama’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the u.s. illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.  the program, known as daca, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by reuters.      a department of homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect daca recipients and other migrants from deportation.  on the campaign trail, trump vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.      the internal memo summarizing the meeting between trump’s transition team and u.s. customs and border protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.  the department of homeland security official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. u.s. customs and border protection then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the u.s. canada border.  reuters reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of canada and the states of washington, idaho, montana, new york, vermont, new hampshire and maine.     adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.  pedestrian fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.  in fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the u.s. canada border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the u.s. mexico border.

" the white house threatened on tuesday to veto a senate defense policy bill, saying it would prevent president barack obama from closing the detention facility at guantanamo bay and limit the size of his national security council. “the bill would undermine expert judgments of the (defense) department’s civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the president and the secretary of defense to appropriately manage and direct the nation’s defense,” the white house said in a statement. the $602 billion national defense authorization act, or ndaa, sets spending policy for the pentagon each year. the republican led congress generally uses the must pass bill as a vehicle for a range of policy measures. the senate armed services committee passed the bill last month. it is now being debated in the full senate, where lawmakers have introduced hundreds of amendments.  obama had already threatened to veto the house of representatives’ version of the annual bill, which passed that chamber last month. the white house opposed it for a number of reasons, including its use of $18 billion in special war funds for day to day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. the senate version did not adopt that strategy. but senator john mccain, the armed services committee’s republican chairman, filed an amendment with a similar plan to use $18 billion of so called overseas contingency operations, or oco, funds to pay for additional troops, more equipment and an increase in a planned military pay increase. mccain and other republicans argued that the increased spending was necessary to keep americans safe. in a statement, he criticized obama’s veto threat as “a sorry defense of the status quo,” and said he hoped obama would change his mind. “i hope when the ndaa reaches the president’s desk, he understands the critical importance of this legislation to our national security better than his administration seems to now,” mccain said. democrats said they would support more military spending if republicans also approved spending on civilian programs. harry reid, the top democrat in the senate, said democrats would offer their own amendment, adding funding for airport security, to combat zika, for local police, to fight opioid addiction and improve infrastructure. “if the republicans pass the defense amendment but then block a similar increase to middle class programs, they will have broken the budget agreement and the appropriations process will come to a grinding halt,” reid told a news conference. after the house and senate pass their versions of the ndaa, the two chambers agree on a final version of the bill. if that passes, it is sent for obama to veto or sign into law. obama vetoed the 2016 ndaa because it sought to increase defense spending by using the war funds, and over the restrictions involving the u.s. prison at guantanamo bay, cuba, for terrorism suspects. he eventually signed a version with the guantanamo measures after the spending plan was removed.

" illinois’ democratic controlled house of representatives passed big, permanent increases in income tax rates and a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan on sunday with the help of some republican votes as the cash strapped state scrambled to stave off a bond rating downgrade to junk.     the $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72 45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from republican governor bruce rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. it would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. the spending plan won passage in a 81 34 vote. both bills now head to the democratic led senate, which returns to session on monday, for concurrence votes. the country’s fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third straight fiscal year on saturday without a complete budget. a fiscal stalemate between illinois’ governor and democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state’s credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. the pair of decisive house votes set democrats on a collision course with rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to house speaker michael madigan.  “the legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago,” rauner said in a statement. “instead, they allowed mike madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable.” rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. in order for rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 house republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. the measure passed the house with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. in his own statement after the votes, madigan praised how republicans and democrats together took a “crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way.” the tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on friday ordered increased payments on medicaid provider bills. in giving democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the legislation to the state senate, some house republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next year’s elections and delivered a pointed challenge to rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state’s fiscal health. “i say to the governor, if these bills pass the house and senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills,” said state representative david harris, who was among 15 republicans to side with democrats. “bring this madness to an end.” their defiance came after house republican leader jim durkin, a rauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent “an exercise in good faith,” given that negotiations involving some of the governor’s non budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

" a tennessee state lawmaker was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four year period in a state attorney general’s report released on wednesday.  republican representative jeremy durham repeatedly made unwelcomed advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists since being elected in 2012, according to a report issued to a legislative committee investigating his conduct. durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said, and he was not immediately available for comment. “the investigation has been a politically motivated, unfair and unconstitutional process,” said durham’s attorney bill harbison in a statement to the nashville cbs affiliate news channel 5. the report details interviews with 22 unnamed women who described numerous occasions when the married legislator flirted and made suggestive sexual comments or physical advances toward them.  in one case, durham had sex with an 20 year old campaign worker in his legislative office and again in his home. on several occasions, he sent text messages or used social media to make “inappropriate” comments to several women.  one of the women described the messages as “terribly inappropriate” while another said his behavior “creeped her out.” a lobbyist told investigators that durham suggested he would vote for a bill she was promoting if she entertained his advances. “i’m for your bill but i’m going to expect something in return,” he told her according to the report.  in a memo attached to the report, the committee said it will leave durham’s fate to the voters as he is up for re election in november.

" iranians quickly closed ranks against a hawkish new u.s. approach to tehran, but iran s powerful hardliners are set to exploit the latest dispute with washington to weaken domestic rivals who are open to the west, analysts and insiders say. president donald trump s warning on friday that he might ultimately terminate a landmark 2015 nuclear deal sets the stage for an eventual resurgence of political infighting within iran s complex power structures, officials said. if the accord signed by iran and six major powers does start to fall apart, anyone who strongly promoted it, such as pragmatist president hassan rouhani, could face a career damaging backlash.  that could leave iran s security hardliners unchallenged at home, enabling greater iranian assertiveness abroad that could worsen tensions in the middle east, analysts say. for the moment, solidarity within the islamic republic s faction ridden political elite is the priority.  what matters now is unity against the foreign enemy,  a senior official told reuters on condition of anonymity, like other figures contacted within iran because of the sensitivity of the matter.  our national interest is a priority for all iranian officials.  but rouhani and pragmatists and reformist allies who promoted the deal, which lifted sanctions in return for tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb making potential, may become increasingly politically vulnerable at home.  golden opportunity  for rouhani s critics trump on friday defied both u.s. allies and adversaries by refusing to formally certify that tehran is complying with the accord even though international inspectors say it is.  the growing tension with america is a golden opportunity for hardliners to clip rouhani s wings,  said a rouhani ally, who was involved in the 18 month nuclear talks.  iran s top authority, hardline supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, guardedly backed rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers, but has repeatedly expressed pessimism about washington remaining committed to it. for rouhani the stakes are high: his rapprochement with the world won him enhanced popularity at home and prestige abroad, dealing a setback to khamenei s hardline allies, who oppose both detente with the west and domestic liberalization. now the tables may be turning.   hardliners will use trump s threat as a sword of damocles over rouhani s head ... while enjoying the economic benefits of the deal,  said tehran based political analyst saeed leylaz, referring to the lifting of tough oil and banking sanctions.   rouhani and his detente policy with the world will be weakened if the deal does not survive,  another senior iranian official said.   and of course an aggressive regional policy is inevitable.  under iran s unique dual system of clerical and republican rule, the elected president is subordinate to the unelected khamenei, who has in the past reasserted control when infighting threatened the existence of the islamic republic. trump s policy will play into the hands of hardliners eventually, said an ally of khamenei.  what matters is the islamic republic and its interests.  tit for tat steps in reaction to trump, rouhani signaled iran would withdraw from the agreement if it failed to preserve tehran s interests. the survival of the deal now is up to the u.s. congress, which might try to modify it or reimpose u.s. sanctions on iran.  but even if the congress refuses to consider sanctions, the deal could still be in jeopardy if washington and tehran resort to tit for tat retaliatory steps.   as long as both sides only exchange words, business will continue as usual,  said leylaz.  since the lifting of sanctions, rouhani has started to repair an economy ravaged by a decade of restrictions on its vital oil industry and issued warm welcomes to global investors. but major european investors could think twice about involvement in iran if tension mounts with the united states and uncertainty grows over survival of the accord.  if european companies don t have the comfort of a political agreement endorsed by the americans they will say stop,  said a senior french diplomat. among european firms that have announced big deals in iran since the deal took effect are planemaker airbus air.pa, french energy group total totf.pa and germany s siemens siegn.de.  trump enraged tehran by saying that the revolutionary guards, which have fought iran s regional proxy wars for decades, was khamenei s  corrupt personal terror force and militia . rouhani said iranians would always stand by the guards.  several officials agreed that trump s hostility would not change iran s regional behavior, determined by khamenei. but if trump somehow made good on his threats,  then iran will adopt a harsher and aggressive regional policy,  said one of the officials familiar with iran s decision making policy. iran and its rival saudi arabia accuse each other of fuelling regional tensions. the sunni muslim kingdom is at odds with tehran s revolutionary shi ite leaders in struggles across the arab world, including syria, yemen, iraq, bahrain and lebanon.  on social policy, rouhani s scope to loosen restrictions on individual freedoms and rights would be crushed by hardliners if  he loses political prestige. hardliners control the judiciary, security forces and state media.  whenever pressured abroad, the regime increases pressure at home to silence any opposition,  said a former moderate official.

" a cambodian court on saturday charged two journalists with espionage for filing news reports to a u.s. funded radio station, which can carry a prison term of up to 15 years. prime minister hun sen, the strongman who has ruled cambodia for more than three decades, has taken a strident anti american line in an increasingly tense run up to a 2018 election and there has been a crackdown on critics, rights groups and independent media. the united states announced it was ending funding for the election, and promised more  concrete steps , after the supreme court dissolved the main opposition cambodia national rescue party (cnrp) on thursday at the request of the government, on the grounds it was plotting to seize power. the party denied the accusation.     the two journalists, uon chhin and yeang sothearin, had in the past worked for the washington based radio free asia (rfa) which broadcast in the khmer language until it shut down in september. the two were charged with  providing information that is destructive to national defense to a foreign state , when they were caught filing stories to rfa, said ly sophana, a spokesman at phnom penh municipal court.  they will be sent to an investigating judge for further procedures,  ly sophana told reuters. rfa has said it had no ties to the two journalists since it shut its phnom penh office in september.  in charging two former rfa journalists with espionage, cambodian authorities have opened the door to more serious forms of intimidation worthy of despots and dictators,  rfa spokesman rohit mahajan said in emailed comments. a lawyer for the two said the charges were too serious and they had merely been doing their jobs as journalists.  this is not dangerous to the country,  said the lawyer, keo vanny.   the charges carried up to 15 years in prison if the men were convicted, he said. hun sen has been fighting a deepening war of words with the u.s. embassy and state department over his government s crackdown on the opposition. cnrp leader kem sokha was arrested on sept. 3 and charged with treason for an alleged plot to take power with u.s. help. he denied any such pot. the u.s. state department called on friday for cambodia to release him and reverse the decision to ban his party. western countries, which for decades supported cambodia s emergence from war and isolation, have shown little appetite for sanctions in response to the government s crackdown, but the european union has raised the possibility of cambodia losing vital trade preferences.

" the trump administration moved on thursday to make permanent a new questionnaire that asks some u.s. visa applicants to provide their social media handles and detailed biographical and travel history, according to a public notice. the questionnaire was rolled out in may as part of an effort to tighten vetting of would be visitors to the united states, and asks for all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (see: bit.ly/2v0qsr2) a state department official declined to provide data on how many times the form had been used or which nationalities had been asked to fill it out since may, only stating that it estimates 65,000 visa applicants per year “will present a threat profile” that warrants the extra screening. president donald trump ran for office in 2016 pledging to crack down on illegal immigration for security reasons, and has called for “extreme vetting” of foreigners entering the united states. on wednesday, he threw his support behind a bill that would cut legal immigration to the united states by 50 percent over 10 years. the office of management and budget, which must approve most new federal requests of information from the public, initially approved the form on an “emergency” basis, which allowed its use for six months rather than the usual three years. the state department published a notice in the federal register on thursday seeking to use the form for the next three years. the public has 60 days to comment on the request. (see: bit.ly/2uznxjd) the questions are meant to “more rigorously evaluate applicants for terrorism, national security related, or other visa ineligibilities,” the notice said. while the questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of a visa application. trump ordered a temporary travel ban in march on citizens of iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. after months of legal wrangling, the supreme court in june allowed the travel ban to go forward with a limited scope. the form does not target any particular nationality. seyed ali sepehr, who runs an immigration consultancy in california serving iranian clients applying for u.s. visas, said that since late june, all of his clients who have been referred for extra security checks have also been asked to fill out the new form. kiyanoush razaghi, an immigration attorney based in maryland, said he knows of iraqis, libyans and iranians who have been asked to fill out the form. immigration attorney steve pattison said one of his clients, who is not from one of the six travel ban countries, had been asked to fill out the new form when applying for a visitor visa, indicating that consular officers are using it broadly.  “it could be that everyone is missing another consequence of the use of the form – its deployment in a far wider sense to cover all sorts of individuals,” pattison said.

" two boston brothers accused of urinating on and beating a homeless mexican man and telling police “donald trump was right: all these illegals need to be deported,” were sentenced to prison on monday, prosecutors said. scott leader, 38, and steve leader, 30, had previously pleaded guilty to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among other charges. scott leader was sentenced to three years in prison and steve leader was sentenced to 1 1/2 years, the suffolk county district attorney’s office said in a statement. the pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end. the leaders were arrested on aug. 19 on suspicion of beating rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. the men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant.  the victim, guillermo rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident. “i came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. i actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if i had been undocumented i still would not have deserved to be beaten this way,” rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by assistant district attorney nicole rimar before the sentencing. the pair punched and kicked rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said. according to a police report, they told officers, “donald trump was right: all these illegals need to be deported.” prosecutors said scott leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and hispanic. the pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody. trump, the presumptive republican nominee for the u.s. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the u.s. mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the united states. trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration but later called it “terrible.” lawyers for the two men could not be reached for immediate comment on monday night.

" the international community must remain united and enforce sanctions against north korea after its repeated launch of ballistic missiles, japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in an editorial published in the new york times on sunday. abe s editorial was published before world leaders gather in new york for a united nations general assembly meeting this week, where north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are expected to loom large over proceedings. north korea launched a missile over japan on friday, its second in the past three weeks, and conducted its sixth and by far most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3, in defiance of international pressure. such tests are in violation of u.n. security council resolutions and show that north korea can now target the united states or europe, abe said. diplomacy and dialogue will not work with north korea and concerted pressure by the entire international community is essential to tackle the threats posed by north korea, abe wrote. a week ago, the 15 member u.n. security council unanimously adopted its ninth sanctions resolution since 2006 over north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

" u.s. president donald trump will not go to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (dmz) on the border of north korea and south korea during his asia trip, a senior administration official said on tuesday.  the president is not going to visit the dmz. there is not enough time in the schedule,  the official told reporters in a background briefing.  instead, trump will be the first american president to visit camp humphreys, a military installation south of the south korean capital of seoul.   we thought that would make more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there,  the official said. u.s. defense secretary jim mattis visited the demilitarized zone that divides the korean peninsula last week and vice president mike pence made the same trip in april.  the official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity in briefing reporters, noted the two trump administration forays to the zone.  it s becoming a little bit of a cliche, frankly,  the official said. trump leaves for his first trip to asia this week and is expected to arrive on november 5 in tokyo.  separately, two u.s. officials said a decision may be made for the three aircraft carriers currently in the asia pacific region to carry out an exercise to coincide with trump s trip. the officials said no decision had been made, but it would be the first exercise with three u.s. aircraft carriers in the region since 2007. a senior state department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the buildup of naval forces was part of the military component of the trump administration s strategy to put  maximum pressure  on north korea, which includes sanctions and diplomatic isolation. earlier on tuesday, the state department welcomed a decision by china and south korea to resume normal ties after a year long standoff over a decision by seoul and washington to deploy a missile defense system to counter north korea s nuclear program.

" ivory coast will pay thousands of soldiers 15 million cfa francs  ($25,782) each as part of buy outs aimed at reducing the size of its unruly and mutiny prone military, documents showed on monday. africa s fastest growing economy in 2016, ivory coast was hit earlier this year by successive uprisings by low ranking troops. the costly bonuses paid to end the unrest helped balloon the budget deficit this year, and the episode tarnished its image as one of the continent s rising economic stars. the government said last week that it would retire around 1,000 soldiers by the end of the year as part of efforts to bring the force   estimated at about 25,000 troops   in line with  accepted standards . a spokesman did not say last week how much the soldiers would receive under the voluntary scheme. however, a document obtained by reuters outlining the plan stated that each retired soldier would receive a payment of 15 million cfa francs. neither the spokesman nor ivory coast s defense minister were available to comment on monday. diplomats said the move signaled that the government was beginning to implement a military reform law. according to a copy of the law seen by reuters, 4,400 troops are to leave the army over four years.  it was not immediately clear if that figure includes soldiers already scheduled to retire during the period. ivory coast s army was thrown together from rival loyalist and rebel factions at the end of a 2011 civil war that brought president alassane ouattara to power after his predecessor laurent gbagbo rejected his defeat in a 2010 run off election. it remains plagued by internal divisions. diplomats and analysts say the force is bloated with unqualified personnel and vulnerable to political manipulation. an adviser to parliament speaker guillaume soro, considered a leading candidate to replace term limited president ouattara in 2020, was arrested in october after a secret arms cache at his home helped mutinying soldiers halt a loyalist advance. soro and his supporters say the charges were politically motivated.

" more than 60 rohingya muslim refugees from myanmar are believed to have drowned when their boat capsized, the latest victims in what the united nations says is the world s fastest developing refugee emergency. the refugees drowned in heavy seas off bangladesh late on thursday, part of a new surge of people fleeing a myanmar military campaign that began on aug. 25 and has triggered an exodus of some 502,000 people. international anger over the crisis is growing. in new york, u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley called on countries to suspend providing weapons to myanmar over the violence. it was the first time the united states had called for punishment of myanmar s military, but she stopped short of threatening to reimpose u.s. sanctions which were suspended under the obama administration. buddhist majority myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and has denounced rights abuses. its military launched a big offensive in response to coordinated attacks on the security forces by rohingya insurgents in the north of rakhine state on aug. 25. u.n. secretary general antonio guterres told the security council the violence had spiraled into the  world s fastest developing refugee emergency, a humanitarian and human rights nightmare . colonel anisul haque, head of the bangladeshi border guards in the town of teknaf, told reuters more refugees had arrived over the past day or two after the number had seemed to be tailing off, with about 1,000 landing at the main entry point on the coast on thursday. the refugee boat capsized in driving rain and high seas as darkness fell. an official with the international organization for migration said 23 people were confirmed dead and 40 were missing. seventeen survived.  we re now saying 40 missing, which suggests the total fatality rate will be in the range of 63,  the official, joe millman, told a news briefing in geneva. one survivor, abdul kalam, 55, said his wife, two daughters and a grandson were among the dead, who were buried at tearful funerals on friday. kalam said armed buddhists came to his village about a week ago and took livestock and food. he said villagers were summoned to a military office and told there were no such people as rohingya in myanmar. after that he decided to leave and headed to the coast with his family, avoiding military camps on the way. a spokesman for the u.n. refugee agency said a fifth of new arrivals were suffering from acute malnutrition. the bangladeshi red crescent said its clinics were treating increasing numbers of people with acute diarrhea. the world health organization has said one of the diseases it is particularly worried about is cholera.   we re seeing the absolute perfect breeding ground for a major health crisis,  said unni krishnan, director of save the children s emergency health unit. in a ramping up of the pressure on myanmar, also known as burma, haley echoed u.n. accusations that the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in rakhine state was ethnic cleansing.  we cannot be afraid to call the actions of the burmese authorities what they appear to be   a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority,  haley told the u.n. security council. the united states said earlier the army response to the insurgent attacks was  disproportionate  and the crisis raised questions about myanmar s transition, under the leadership of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi, after decades of military rule. suu kyi has no power over the generals under a military drafted constitution. she has nevertheless drawn scathing criticism from around the world for not stopping the violence. the public in myanmar, where buddhist nationalism has surged over recent years, largely supports the offensive against the insurgents. haley said the military must respect rights and fundamental freedoms, and those who had been accused of abuses should be removed from command and prosecuted.  and any country that is currently providing weapons to the burmese military should suspend these activities until sufficient accountability measures are in place,  she said. there was no ethnic cleansing or genocide in myanmar, its national security adviser, thaung tun, said at the united nations, adding that myanmar had invited guterres to visit. china and russia, which have veto powers in the security council, expressed support for myanmar. the u.n. human rights council extended the mandate of a myanmar fact finding mission by six months, until september 2018, over the objections of myanmar, china and the philippines. myanmar s representative said the mission was  not helpful, was not in line with the situation on the ground and would do no good to finding a solution to rakhine issues . myanmar says it will not grant visas to mission investigators.

" hundreds of serbian pensioners rallied in belgrade on thursday to protest austerity measures introduced as part of a 1.2 billion euro ($1.41 billion) loan deal with the international monetary fund. chanting  thieves  and carrying banners reading  we are hungry , the pensioners demanded that the government and serbia s constitutional court annul austerity cuts imposed in 2014 and refund lost pension payouts. the government of then prime minister aleksandar vucic signed a three year loan deal with the imf in february 2015 after belgrade committed to austerity to cut its ballooning debt and budget deficit. to secure the deal, in late 2014 it lowered public sector wages and pensions by between five and 25 percent.   as many as 700,000 people lost a quarter of their monthly income ... we ve been paying to that (retirement) fund for 45 years, hoping for a stable old age,  said protester milorad pavicic, 80.  about 1.7 million of serbia s 7 million citizens are retirees and the government spends 13 percent of gdp on pensions, world bank data show. the average pension in serbia, a candidate to join the european union, is 190 euros, among the lowest in eastern europe. earlier this month, serbia s current prime minister ana brnabic said the government will raise wages for doctors, teachers and army officers by 10 percent and pensions by five percent from january next year.  pensioners were also slated to receive a one off payment of up to 6,000 serbian dinars ($59.38) in 2017. thursday s protesters dismissed the measures as insufficient. the government has yet to discuss the wage and pension rises with the imf s mission, in a final review of the deal this month and next.  the lender cut serbia s 2017 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 3.0 percent, citing a drop in electricity output in winter and lower than expected harvest due to months of drought.

" republican presidential nominee donald trump’s support has sharply fallen in utah where a poll on wednesday showed him tied with democrat hillary clinton in a state that has voted republican in presidential races for decades.     the survey of 500 people from salt lake city based y2 analytics also showed a surge for evan mcmullin, an ex cia officer running as an independent.     trump and clinton were both at 26 percent while mcmullin, a member of the mormon faith that dominates in utah, trailed just behind at 22 percent. the telephone poll of likely voters was conducted on monday and tuesday, after a video featuring comments from trump about groping women surfaced last week.  the survey underscored the level of disaffection some conservatives have shown for trump, who has found himself at odds with much of the republican party establishment. the last time a republican presidential nominee lost in utah was in the landslide national election victory of president lyndon johnson, a democrat, in 1964. “there’s limits to partisanship even in utah of all places,” scott riding, managing partner of y2 analytics, said. the poll results indicate severe erosion in trump’s popularity in utah even as clinton’s support has grown slightly. a salt lake tribune poll in september put support for trump at 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for clinton. a number of prominent utah republicans, including governor gary herbert and u.s. senator mike lee, pulled their support for trump or called on him to quit the race.  mcmullin, a former cia counter terrorism specialist and investment banker whose campaign is based in utah, is less well known nationally than the other minor candidates, green party nominee jill stein and libertarian party nominee gary johnson. johnson ranked fourth in the y2 analytics poll with support from 14 percent of likely voters, roughly in line with his previous level of support in utah. mcmullin, who is running as a conservative independent, is on the ballot in a dozen states including utah, with plans to expand his reach before the nov. 8 election, according to his campaign spokesman rick wilson.  the vast majority of participants in the poll were familiar with the video tape of trump’s vulgar comments about women during a 2005 recording and a third of them said it lowered their opinion of the new york businessman. the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.

" nato allies backed plans on wednesday for two new military headquarters to help protect europe in the event of a conflict with russia, laying the ground for the u.s. led alliance s biggest expansion in decades. hoping to add to its deterrent factor against russia, nato defense ministers agreed to create an atlantic command and a logistics command to help respond more quickly to threats in europe, officials said.  this is vital for our transatlantic alliance,  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg told a news conference.  it is about how to move forces across the atlantic and how to move forces across europe.  costs will not be discussed until 2018 but the two new regional bases have broad support and show nato s focus on its traditional task of defending its territory after out of area campaigns in the balkans, libya and afghanistan in recent years. germany is eager to host the logistics command, diplomats said, given its strategic location straddling central europe, allowing for swift movement of equipment and personnel across borders in the event of a conflict.  maritime nations such as portugal, spain, france and the united states could host the atlantic command, diplomats said, stressing that no decision had yet been taken.  in a staggered response to russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula, nato has already put troops on rotation in the baltic states and poland, strengthened its presence in the black sea and sought to modernize its forces. the kremlin, which denies harboring any aggressive intentions toward europe, has condemned the moves as an attempt to encircle russia. nato says russia s war games in september, which massed tens of thousands of troops on the alliance s eastern flank, are another reason for it to be better prepared to deter moscow. russia has increased its naval patrols in the baltic sea, the north atlantic and the arctic and deployed submarines, nato officials say, although the size of its navy is smaller now than during the cold war era.  we want to pull nato back to europe, and we want to focus more on nato s maritime role,  norway s defence minister frank bakke jensen said.  the new atlantic command would survey a vast area and have the task of making sea lanes safe for u.s. reinforcements to europe, manned by experts in cyber warfare as well as conventional weapons. the maritime area between greenland, iceland and britain is a clear vulnerability for nato in a conflict and that needs better surveillance in peacetime, diplomats said. the decision is unlikely to revive a much larger cold war era atlantic command that was disbanded in 2002, but it would mean an expansion for nato after years of cutbacks following the fall of the soviet union. at the height of the cold war, the number of personnel manning nato s then 33 commands reached 22,000. there are just seven such commands today, with fewer than 7,000 people. nato countries also agreed on wednesday to provide cyber weapons to top commanders for use in military operations and missions, officials said, potentially allowing the alliance to take on computer hackers for the first time. the step follows nato s decision last year to make cyber a domain of warfare along with land, sea and air, although until now commanders were limited to defensive tasks. under the agreement taken by nato defense ministers, alliance commanders can now call on allies such as the united states and britain to take down a hostile server or a website, although the details have yet to be formalized.  it may be a more proportionate response,  stoltenberg said.

" to preserve federal funding for critical rail projects, new jersey and new york senators on wednesday asked u.s. transportation secretary elaine chao to examine firsthand the decaying train tunnels that threaten to cripple regional travel if they fail. in a letter to chao, four democratic senators, two each from new york and new jersey, asked chao to visit before republican president donald trump’s administration finalizes any federal infrastructure package. they also urged chao to support amtrak’s gateway program, which includes building a passenger rail tunnel underneath the hudson river in partnership with nj transit, the two states, and their bi state port authority.  that project, which had been fast tracked by chao’s predecessor in the administration of former president barack obama, is considered one of the most important infrastructure projects in the nation. “we’re teetering every single day on the brink of truly a traffic armageddon,” u.s. senator corey booker said at a news conference in newark’s penn station about the invitation to chao he issued with new york senators chuck schumer and kirsten gillibrand and fellow new jersey senator robert menendez.  “the new administration has to come to the table with a commitment to what is not just a new jersey problem, not just a regional problem, but really an american problem,” booker said. the area is also a chokepoint on amtrak’s northeast corridor, a key section of rail that connects washington to boston. the transportation department said in a statement that chao intends to tour a number of the country’s infrastructure projects, including the gateway site. an important source of funding for gateway and some other u.s. projects is uncertain because trump proposed cutting the federal new starts grant program in his initial budget plan.  two nj transit train derailments in recent weeks, both the fault of amtrak, badly snarled commutes. they also prompted new jersey governor chris christie, a republican, to say he would halt state payments to the national rail operator, from which nj transit leases tracks. at the news conference, a handful of protesters criticized christie for underfunding new jersey transportation and cancelling a previous rail tunnel project. the governor on wednesday blamed problems on “an absolute failure of the federal government to stand up to their obligations” to maintain infrastructure and said amtrak is part of chao’s responsibility. he said he had spoken to trump about the gateway project.

" illegal immigrants who survived a fire that killed about 80 people in a social housing block in london will be given a clear path to obtaining permanent residency in britain, the government said on wednesday. but critics including the local member of parliament said people whose lives were devastated by the disaster should be given indefinite leave to remain now and the government s announcement would merely add to their confusion and despair. the 24 storey grenfell tower, which was home to many immigrants and people from ethnic minorities, was gutted on june 14 in an inferno that started in the middle of the night and engulfed the whole building with devastating speed. the tower is located in a deprived estate within one of london s richest boroughs, and the disaster prompted a wave of soul searching about inequality and neglect of poor communities. some of the approximately 250 people who made it out of the building alive did not have the legal right to live in britain and have been reluctant to make themselves known to the authorities. the government had previously said that if they came forward, those people would be given leave to remain legally in britain for 12 months   a stance criticized as ungenerous to people whose lives had been devastated by the tragedy.  the government believes it is right to provide this specific group of survivors greater certainty over their long term future in the uk, subject to ... the necessary security and criminality checks being met,  immigration minister brandon lewis said in a statement. under the new policy, after the initial period of 12 months, grenfell survivors would be able to apply for further periods of limited leave to remain, building up to five years. they could then apply for permanent residency. emma dent coad, a member of parliament from the opposition labour party who represents the area where grenfell stands, dismissed the conservative government s announcement as an inadequate fudge.  this is very far from the amnesty requested by volunteer groups and legal representatives,  she said.  once again survivors of the worst ever peacetime atrocity are being short changed by this confusing and half hearted response.  asked why permanent residency rights were not being offered now, a spokesman for the home office, or interior ministry, said the government had to act within immigration laws as they stood. martin moore bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the fire, was among those who had asked the government to reconsider the previous policy, saying some survivors did not want to take part in his investigation because of fears over their long term immigration status. sue caro, a campaigner for grenfell survivors, said wednesday s announcement was unlikely to make any difference because people were deeply suspicious of the authorities after years of anti immigration government rhetoric.  it won t have the desired effect,  she said.  this is an attempt to pacify all sides and it achieves nothing.  the grenfell tower fire prompted an outpouring of emotion from many britons, who donated money and clothes to try and help survivors. but some people have also expressed negative views, saying that undocumented migrants should not be allowed to stay.

" republicans will continue to dominate state legislatures in the wake of tuesday’s election, which kept their party in control of congress and put donald trump in the white house, legislative analysts said on wednesday. after an election in which more than 80 percent of 7,383 state legislative seats nationwide were up for grabs, republicans and democrats were likely to control the same number of chambers they had previously, according to the bipartisan national conference of state legislatures (ncsl), which is still compiling voting results. republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the 2010 mid term election, held the majority in 67 of the country’s 98 partisan legislative chambers, while democrats had 31 going into the election. nebraska’s single chamber is nonpartisan. “neither party can sort of boast of having a big night down on the state level,” ncsl elections analyst tim storey said. “republicans will remain in a dominant position in terms of policy making.” in kentucky, republicans took over the house of representatives for the first time since 1921, while defeating longtime democratic house speaker greg stumbo, according to the republican legislative campaign committee. that result leaves republicans in control of all 30 legislative chambers in the u.s. south for the first time in history, storey said. republicans also wrested control of the iowa senate and the minnesota senate from democrats, according to ncsl. democrats hit their target in the new mexico house of representatives, gaining a majority of seats, and took over both chambers of the nevada legislature. in hawaii, the only republican in the senate was ousted, making the democratic controlled chamber the first all one party state legislative chamber since 1980. one chamber, the connecticut senate, came out of the election tied. democrats retained control of the illinois legislature but lost their veto proof majority in the house after republican governor bruce rauner and his top donors invested tens of millions of dollars in a bid to weaken long serving democratic house speaker michael madigan. the control of the new york senate was still undetermined, ncsl said. missouri’s legislature and governor’s office will be totally under republican control after eric greitens won the race to succeed term limited democratic governor jay nixon. vermont will be split with the election of republican phil scott as governor. republicans extended their majority of u.s. governorships in tuesday’s vote.

" u.s. president donald trump’s picks for two open spots on the federal reserve’s board of governors may push for tighter monetary policy if they receive the senate confirmation needed to join the fed’s rate setting panel, their records suggest. trump will nominate carnegie mellon university professor marvin goodfriend and former treasury department staffer randal quarles to fill two of the three open seats on the federal reserve’s board of governors, the new york times said on friday, citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the decision.   the conservative picks come as fed chair janet yellen continues to slowly raise interest rates and lay out plans to shed some of the trillions of dollars of bonds bought in the wake of the financial crisis.  goodfriend in particular has been skeptical of the fed’s bond buying programs, saying that it is too close to fiscal policy. goodfriend and quarles did not immediately respond on friday to requests for comment. a white house spokeswoman said officials were not ready to make an announcement yet.     goodfriend, 66, a former richmond fed policy advisor, also has urged the central bank to adopt simpler rules governing policy decisions.  that view has support among many congressional republicans, though yellen has strongly opposed their proposed legislation on grounds that it would tie the fed to make mechanical decisions that would harm the economy. the rule at the center of that legislation suggests the fed should be raising rates more aggressively than the three annual rate hikes policymakers currently expect for both 2017 and 2018. that could make for an interesting dynamic with bond investors increasingly skeptical of faster rate hikes amid uncertainty over the outlook for tax cuts under trump’s young administration.  after friday’s report that employers added fewer than expected jobs in may, short term interest rate futures traders were still pricing in a june rate hike, but treasury yields fell as investors reduced bets on subsequent hikes. 	 one area goodfriend may agree with yellen is on the fed’s plan to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet before the end of the year. though the fed has not published its plan in detail, policymakers have said the portfolio would shrink as if on “autopilot.” in an interview with reuters last november, goodfriend appeared to also support such a preset plan. “the fed should choose a rule for shrinking the balance sheet so that, as it sold off its assets, it was pre committed and markets could anticipate sales and prepare for them,” he said. despite differences of opinion with yellen, he said then, “if there is interest in my point of view and my 30 something years of thinking, writing, and teaching about the fed and central banking, then i would have to consider serving.”  a lawyer by profession, quarles, 59, worked on financial regulation at the u.s. treasury for years, including during the 2007 2009 financial crisis. reuters had earlier reported he was a leading candidate to be trump’s pick for the fed’s vice chair in charge of banking supervision.  “many market participants have been barking up the wrong tree, arguing that trump is an easy money guy because he borrowed a lot when he was a real estate tycoon,” said stephen stanley, amherst pierpont’s chief economist, who worked for goodfriend when he was at the richmond fed. “if these two nominees are eventually confirmed, the tone of the fed board will instantly swing to a far more hawkish tenor.” ",0

" a south korean court on wednesday assigned five state attorneys to defend disgraced former president park geun hye, following her defense team s resignation last week in protest at the extension of her detention period until april next year. park is standing trial accused of bribery, abuse of power and coercion, having been forced to step down in march after parliament voted to impeach her at the end of 2016. she has been held in detention since late march, although under south korean law a defendant in a criminal trial at a lower court can be detained for a maximum of six months. citing concerns that park could destroy evidence if she was released, the seoul central district court issued an additional arrest warrant on oct. 13 in order to extend her detention by six months. the court s move prompted her entire defense team to quit in protest at a session on oct. 16. having lost her legal team, park gave health reasons for her failure to attend a session three days later.   after witnessing the collapse of the presumption of innocence and the principle of investigation without detention, we concluded that our efforts to defend park will be meaningless,  park s former lawyer, yoo yeong ha, told the court last week.   the court s decision to issue an additional arrest warrant will remain as one of humiliating moments in south korea s judiciary history,  yoo said. a seoul central district court spokesman said five state attorneys had been appointed to take over park s defense. citing court sources, yonhap news agency reported the new defense team would have to review about 120,000 pages of court documents to prepare for upcoming hearings. park s supporters have asked a united nations body to investigate whether park was being prevented from getting proper medical treatment and possible violation of her human rights due to her detention.

" the white house has signaled to congressional republican leaders that it has pulled back from u.s. president donald trump’s threat to shut down the government if a border wall with mexico is not funded, the washington post reported on friday, citing a senior republican congressional aide. trump promised to build a wall with mexico on the campaign trail. he also threatened recently to shut down the government if congress did not provide funding for the wall. but shortly after trump made those comments, white house officials quietly notified congress that the $1.6 billion would not need to be in a stopgap funding bill meant to fund government operations from october until sometime in early december, a senior gop congressional aide said, according to the post. however, trump still wants wall funding to be included in the december budget bill, the post said.

" the u.s. senate agriculture committee on thursday approved a reauthorization of the commodity futures trading commission, nearly three years after the legislative authority for the country’s commodities and swaps regulator expired. the head of the cftc, timothy massad, praised the committee for clearing the way for the full senate to vote on authorization. “i am committed to continuing to work with congress throughout this process, particularly on making sure end users like agricultural producers can continue to safely and affordably use the derivatives markets, while ensuring these markets do not generate excessive risk to our financial system,” he said in a statement.  the cftc has operated on year by year funding since the end of 2013 because congress has not passed a new authorization, which lawmakers say created uncertainty in many markets. the house of representatives has already approved a similar bill. republicans, who control the senate, said the bill would allow farmers, ranchers and small energy providers to use derivatives for hedging operational costs without being ensnared in regulation intended to prevent the risky type of swap deals that contributed to the financial crisis.  the bill “allows for anticipatory hedges and the management of a hedge when it serves as a risk management tool for our producers and commercial end users and not an investment or for speculation,” said committee chairman pat roberts of kansas. still, democratic senator sherrod brown of ohio, a proponent of strong wall street oversight, said the bill as written would also benefit financial players. “it’s clear that this bill is all about helping wall street traders and big energy companies like koch industries under the guise of helping farmers,” he said. massad’s major concern involved funding. the senior democrat on the committee, debbie stabenow of michigan, sought to add a provision that would create a model for backing the cftc similar to that used for the securities and exchange commission, which offsets taxpayer funds it receives with fees and fines. the proposal was not included in the final bill.  “the funding language proposed by senator stabenow addresses the fact that we are the only federal financial regulator without some form of fee based funding,” massad said. republican john boozman of arkansas, who has say over the cftc’s budget as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on financial services, shot down the idea, describing funding tied to fines as a “bounty program.” ",0

" united nations political affairs chief jeffrey feltman arrived in north korea on tuesday for a rare visit that some analysts and diplomats hope could spark a u.n. led effort to defuse rising tensions over pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. the former senior u.s. state department official is the highest level u.n. official to visit north korea since 2011. during a four day visit he is due to meet foreign minister ri yong ho to discuss  issues of mutual interest and concern.   this is broadly a policy dialogue with (north korea). i think we have to wait and see what comes out,  u.n. spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters on tuesday.  all key member states ... were informed and briefed of the visit.   u.n. secretary general antonio guterres told russia, japan, the united states, china and north and south korea in august he was available to help broker talks. so called six party talks on north korea s nuclear program stalled in 2008. a u.n. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described expectations for feltman s visit as  modest and high at the same time, meaning that they depend on what our hosts are thinking as well.   we need to find a way to scale back tensions,  the official said.  i don t think we will have a major breakthrough being announced at the end of this trip. but the visit could serve as a step to build a framework for engagement.  suzanne dimaggio of the new america foundation think tank, a participant in recent unofficial talks with north korea, said feltman could propose during his visit to pyongyang that guterres play a mediation role.  i do think that the trump administration would like to explore talks about talks at this stage. i think the north koreans are assessing the timing of when to do that,  she told a  seminar in washington on north korea.  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said feltman was not traveling on behalf of the u.s. government.  and he s not traveling   i want to make this clear   with any kind of message from the u.s. government ... he s going on behalf of the u.n., not the u.s. government,  she told a regular news briefing. nauert said washington remained open to talks if north korea showed it was serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, but added:  the activities they have been engaged in recently have shown that they are not interested, they are not serious about sitting down and having conversations.   north korea has been working to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of reaching the united states in defiance of u.n. sanctions. it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in september and last week tested a missile capable of reaching anywhere in america.  feltman told the 15 member security council last week that its unity  creates an opportunity for sustained diplomatic engagement   an opportunity that must be seized in these dangerous times to seek off ramps and work to create conditions for negotiations.  in september, russian u.n. ambassador vassily nebenzia urged a return to dialogue, including  by leveraging mediation efforts  by guterres.  russian deputy foreign minister igor morgulov said on tuesday that pyongyang was seeking dialogue with washington on its nuclear program, according to ria news agency. morgulov, at a conference in berlin, was quoted as saying russia had communication channels with north korea open and was ready to exert its influence on pyongyang. sweden s deputy u.n. ambassador carl skau told reporters he hoped guterres could mediate in  probably the largest threat to international peace and security at the moment.  britain s deputy u.n. ambassador jonathan allen said feltman had  our backing and i think he goes to represent the u.n. family as a whole.

" iran has remained within the main limits on its nuclear activity set by its 2015 deal with six world powers, the u.n. atomic watchdog said in its first report since u.s. president donald trump decertified iranian compliance with the terms. iran undertook to curb its uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and u.n. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified tehran s adherence to the key aspects of the accord. trump has called the agreement between iran, the united states, britain, france, germany, russia, china and the european union  the worst deal ever  and he disavowed iran s compliance last month. his decision did not constitute a u.s. exit from the accord but raised concern about its staying power. trump s move, at odds with the commitment of the other parties to the deal, meant the u.s. congress must decide by mid december whether to reimpose economic sanctions lifted under the accord, reached under his predecessor barack obama. if congress reimposes the sanctions, the united states would in effect be in violation of the deal and it would likely fall apart. if lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. in response, iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said tehran will stick to the nuclear accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would  shred  the deal if washington pulled out. if the deal unravels, it would strengthen hardline opponents of hassan rouhani, iran s pragmatist president who opened up diplomatic channels to western powers to enable nuclear diplomacy after years of worsening confrontation. iran s stock of low enriched uranium as of nov. 5 was 96.7 kg (213.2 pounds), well below a 202.8 kg limit set by the deal, and the level of enrichment did not exceed a maximum 3.67 percent cap, said the confidential international atomic energy agency report sent to iaea member states and seen by reuters. iran s stock of so called heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, a potential nuclear bomb fuel, stood at 114.4 metric tonnes, below a 130 tonne limit agreed by the parties to the deal. the 3.67 percent enrichment and 202 kg stockpile limit on uranium, and the 130 tonne cap on heavy water, aim to ensure that iran does not amass enough material of sufficient fissile purity to produce a nuclear bomb. such a device requires uranium to be refined to around 90 percent purity. iaea director general yukiya amano told reuters in september he would welcome clarification from the powers on how the agency should monitor iran s implementation of the so called section t of the nuclear pact that deals with certain technologies that could be used to develop an atom bomb. russia had been critical of the agency s monitoring of section t provisions, but monday s report said the iaea had verified iran s commitment to the section.

" dawn hues of pink and purple reveal a dusty valley in bangladesh s southern hills quilted with a dense settlement of red tents home to more than 230 women and children grieving for lost husbands and fathers. they are among more than 625,000 rohingya muslims who have fled to bangladesh since late august, following a crackdown by the myanmar military in response to attacks on security forces by rohingya militants.  roshid jan, who walked for 10 days with her five children to bangladesh after soldiers burned their village, wept when she spoke about her missing husband. he was accused of being a member of the rohingya militants and arrested with four other villagers 11 months ago, she said. she had not seen him or heard about his fate since then.  aisha begum, a 19 year old widow, said her husband was killed by myanmar soldiers as their band of refugees headed for bangladesh.   i was sitting there by his body and just crying, crying, crying,  she said.   he was caught and killed with knives. i found his body by the road. it was in three pieces,  she cried, recounting the events that brought her to the camp.  (click reut.rs/2bhppax for a photo essay) most rohingya are stateless and seen as illegal immigrants by buddhist majority myanmar.  the united nations and united states have described the military s actions as ethnic cleansing, and rights groups have accused the security forces of atrocities, including rape, arson and killings. myanmar s government has denied most of the claims, and the army has said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. there are 50 tents and no men in the camp for widows and orphans, the biggest of three sites built with donor funds from muslim majority pakistan in the refugee settlement of balukhali not far from bangladesh s resort town of cox s bazar. two makeshift kitchens provide space for cooking in small holes in the ground, a new well is being dug to supplement a water pump, and a big tent serves for prayers.  for those who can t pray, we have learning sessions on monday and friday in a special room,  said 20 year old suwa leha, who serves as the camp s unofficial leader. praying and reading the muslim holy book, the koran, was one of two conditions for admittance set by religious and group leaders, suwa said. the other was that widows and orphans be selected from among the most vulnerable and needy. the camp is marooned amid ponds and streams of dirty water  left by the washing of clothes and dishes. behind are thousands of dwellings in a vast refugee camp that sprang up during the crisis. still, the women are relieved to have their own space.  for those with no protection, a camp like this is much safer,  said 22 year old rabiya khatun, who lives there with her son.  no man can enter that easily. also, the rooms are bigger and we have more chances of receiving some aid.  women and girls number about 51 percent of the distressed and traumatized rohingya population in the cox s bazar camps, the u.n. women agency said in october.  women and children are also at heightened risk of becoming victims of human trafficking, sexual abuse or child and forced marriage,  it added. women and adolescent girls aged between 13 and 20 arriving from myanmar typically had two to four children each, it said, with some of them pregnant. no relief agencies officially run the camp for the widows and orphans but aid groups and individuals help out. rihana begum lives with her five children in a room that is bare except for a few tomatoes, some religious books and clothes. on a thin mat lies her daughter, ill with fever, but fear of missing food handouts keeps them away from the doctor.    i m afraid to miss aid distribution. i can t afford to miss it,  she said on the day ration cards from the world food program were distributed in the camp. this week, myanmar said it was finalizing terms for a joint working group with bangladesh to launch the process of safe and voluntary return of the rohingya refugees within two months. that may not be enough to allay rihana begum s fears.  i m so afraid that i will never go back to myanmar,  she said.  i would rather die here.

" u.s. president barack obama on friday signed into law an annual defense policy bill, but in a lengthy statement he raised objections to parts of it, including policies blocking him from closing the detention center at guantanamo bay, cuba. obama pledged in his 2008 presidential campaign to close the military prison, but his efforts have been blocked by mostly republican opposition in congress. the democratic president has instead reduced the population there by transferring prisoners to other countries.  the administration recently told congress it would move up to 18 more prisoners of the 59 remaining at guantanamo before obama leaves office next month. “during my administration, we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees from guantanamo,” obama said in the statement on friday. “our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day i am in office.” president elect donald trump, who will be sworn in on jan. 20, said during the campaign that he would keep the guantanamo bay facility open and vowed to “load it up with some bad dudes.” the $618.7 billion defense spending bill passed by the republican controlled congress this month was a compromise version that dropped controversial language requiring women to register for the draft. but it kept some republican backed initiatives obama had opposed. the legislation boosts military spending when there has been no similar increase in non defense funding, and it bars closures of military bases even though top pentagon officials say they have too much capacity.     house of representatives speaker paul ryan, a republican, said on friday the legislation would give u.s. troops a pay raise and praised the guantanamo language. “this ensures that, right up until his last hour in office, president obama will not be able to transfer guantanamo bay detainees to the united states,” ryan said in a statement. obama’s predecessor george w. bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the sept. 11 attacks. under bush, the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture. obama has maintained for years that he considers “onerous restrictions” on his ability to transfer prisoners a violation of the u.s. constitution’s separation of powers between congress and the executive branch. but he gave no indication he would try to override those restrictions. reflecting the growing migration of espionage and warfare into cyberspace, obama also said on friday that he favors splitting the u.s. cyber command, which conducts offensive operations, from the national security agency and making it independent, similar to the military’s european and pacific commands.

" the texas house of representatives gave formal approval on monday to a bill that would restrict bathroom access for transgender students in public schools, a measure that critics say promotes discrimination against such children. the state’s republican controlled legislature has been at the forefront in advancing measures seen by backers as protecting traditional values and religious liberty but criticized by civil rights groups as eroding protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lgbt, people. the texas house gave preliminary approval on sunday night to the bill, which requires public school students to use bathrooms, changing facilities and locker rooms that match their biological sex, not the gender with which they identify. under the bill, school districts have to accommodate students who do not wish to use a common facility based on biological sex with a single occupancy facility, or a multi occupancy facility if its use occurs when no one else is present. the measure is narrower in scope than a bathroom bill passed along mostly party lines by the state senate in march that extended to state universities and public buildings. the senate bill is similar to one enacted last year in north carolina. the north carolina law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events, and was later revamped in the face of criticism. the more limited house measure is seen as a way to avoid an economic backlash in texas, analysts said. “it is absolutely about child safety,” republican state representative chris paddie, who managed the bill, said in house debate on sunday. the measure heads back to the senate for consideration of changes made since it was in that chamber. republican governor greg abbott has said he supports a bathroom bill. critics said the house and senate versions undermined civil rights and used children as political pawns. “there is no moral middle ground on discrimination, “ said kathy miller, president of the civil liberties advocacy group  texas freedom network. the legislature on monday also sent to the governor a bill allowing adoption agencies to reject families on religious grounds, an action slammed by critics as discriminatory against lgbt texans and non christians. lgbt rights groups said they would challenge the adoption bill in court if it became law, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state.  the bill’s backers, which include several christian groups, said it banned no one and had a mechanism for the state government to offer alternative adoption providers if any service is denied for religious beliefs.

" europe s  big four  continental powers and three african states agreed a plan on monday to tackle illegal human trafficking and support nations struggling to contain the flow of people across the desert and mediterranean sea.    the 28 nation european union has long struggled to reach a coherent answer to the influx of migrants fleeing war, poverty and political upheaval in the middle east and africa, and the crisis is testing cooperation between member states. after hosting the leaders of germany, italy, spain, chad, niger and libya, french president emmanuel macron said it was time for greater coordination.    we must all act together   from the source countries to europe and passing by the transit countries, especially libya   to be efficient,  he told reporters.  it s a challenge as much for the eu as for the african union.  while the meeting was sparse on concrete details, the leaders agreed on the principle of setting up a mechanism to identify legitimate migrants who are fleeing war and persecution, and to use the united nations to register them in niger and chad so as to prevent them being exploited by traffickers.  at the core of it, it s all about fighting illegal migration,  german chancellor angela merkel told a news conference.  she said that berlin was willing to increase its efforts.  if we want to stop human traffickers, then this can only be achieved through development aid,  she said. the migrant crisis has put paris and rome at odds. italy has accused france and other eu states of not sharing the migrant burden and has also asked the eu commission for more budget flexibility to help it tackle the crisis.  nearly 120,000 migrants, including refugees, have entered europe by sea so far this year, according to the international organization for migration. more than 2,400 have drowned while making the dangerous journey, often without enough food or water in overcrowded dinghies run by people smugglers.  we are all committed to reducing the damage, the death of africans in the desert, the death of africans crossing the mediterranean,  chad president idriss deby said.   the fundamental problem will always remain development. we need resources,  he said. the informal meeting did not outline any new specific financing and the leaders repeated that stabilizing chaotic libya, where thousands of migrants end up before embarking on a perilous mediterranean sea journey to europe, would be key to any long term solution.

" pope francis flew to bangladesh on thursday after a visit to myanmar where he made no direct reference to the plight of muslim rohingya people to avoid a diplomatic incident with a buddhist majority country some have accused of ethnic cleansing. there will be no such balancing act for the pope in bangladesh s capital, dhaka, where he is expected to meet a group of rohingya refugees from among the roughly 625,000 who have fled neighboring myanmar since the end of august.  the vatican on wednesday defended the pope s decision not to use the word  rohingya  in public during his four day myanmar trip, saying his moral authority was unblemished and that his mere presence drew attention to the refugee crisis. but a vatican news conference in yangon to wrap up the visit only served to highlight the diplomatic minefield that the issue had presented for francis. spokesman greg burke said the pope s decision not to refer to the rohingya did not take away from anything he has said in the past   he had mentioned them and their suffering before his myanmar visit   but added that vatican diplomacy was  not infallible  and others were entitled to their views. muddying the waters for the vatican delegation, a myanmar regional bishop cast doubt at the same news conference about  allegations of ethnic cleansing, suggesting  other communities  might be responsible for stoking them.  when we speak of the truth, we should go to an authoritative source or a reliable source to get the news ...   those who criticize should go to the scene to study the reality and history,  bishop john hsane hgyi said. the global new light of myanmar, a state run daily, seized on the bishop s comments, putting a banner headline on its front page that read  reports of ethnic cleansing in rakhine is not reliable: myanmar church . the exodus of rohingya people from rakhine state to the southern tip of bangladesh was sparked by a military crackdown in response to rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on aug. 25.  scores of rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, and refugees arriving in bangladesh told of killings and rapes. the united nations has accused myanmar of ethnic cleansing and last week washington said the military s campaign included  horrendous atrocities  aimed at  ethnic cleansing . myanmar s military has denied accusations of murder, rape and forced displacement. the government blames the crisis on the rohingya militants, whom it has condemned as terrorists. many people in myanmar regard the largely stateless rohingya as illegal immigrants from bangladesh, they are excluded from the 135  national races  recognized by law, and even using the name is considered inflammatory. although francis studiously avoided the term, following the advice of local church officials who feared it could turn myanmar s military and government against minority christians, his calls for justice, human rights and respect were widely seen as applicable to the rohingya. francis held talks during his trip with myanmar leader aung san suu kyi, a nobel peace laureate and longtime champion of democracy who in 2016 formed myanmar s first civilian government in half a century. suu kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from western nations in recent weeks for expressing doubts about reports of  abuses against rohingya and for failing to condemn the military. china has backed what myanmar officials call a legitimate counter insurgency operation in rakhine, and stepped in to prevent a resolution on the crisis at the u.n. security council, support observers believe will draw suu kyi closer to beijing. myanmar s ministry of foreign affairs said suu kyi left on thursday morning for china to join a forum of world leaders hosted by the communist party of china. suu kyi s defenders say she is hamstrung by a constitution written by the military that left the army in control of security and much of the apparatus of the state. the military s power was clear on monday when senior general min aung hlaing, demanded to meet pope francis before sun kyi, upending a schedule that had her meeting the pontiff first.  i m sure the pope would have preferred meeting the general after he had done the official visits,  spokesman burke said.

" president donald trump told chief executives of major u.s. companies on thursday he plans to bring millions of jobs back to the united states, but offered no specific plan on how to reverse a decades long decline in factory jobs. in his first month in office, trump has pressured a number of u.s. companies to hire in the united states but he has yet to publicly propose legislation tackling the big economic issues he campaigned on in 2016, including a job boosting tax or infrastructure program. he will address a joint session of congress on feb. 28. in a meeting with some two dozen ceos at the white house, trump said the united states had lost about one third of manufacturing jobs since it joined the north american free trade agreement in 1994 and asserted about 70,000 factories have closed since china joined the world trade organization 16 years ago.   but the bureau of labor statistics says the number of private sector manufacturing facilities in the united states has fallen less than that, from nearly 400,000 in 2001 to 344,000 last year. lower wages, automation, foreign competition and other factors account for the steep decline in manufacturing jobs, experts say.    trump has promised to roll out proposals that he says could have favorable ramifications for companies, including a plan to overhaul the tax code and an infrastructure package that was part of his presidential campaign promises to create millions of jobs. he has declined to specify what he had in mind. “we’re going to find out how we bring more jobs back,” he told the ceos.  general electric co (ge.n) chief executive jeff immelt said after the meeting in a twitter post that “tax reform a high priority for job creation. business community will come together to help find a workable solution.” ken frazier, ceo of merck & co (mrk.n), told reporters “it is very clear the president is interested in lessening the tax burden.” several of the ceos who met trump are part of a coalition that supports a so called border adjustment tax, which would impose a 20 percent tax on goods that are imported into the country while providing write offs for goods that are exported.  in an interview with reuters, trump spoke favorably about the border adjustment tax proposal being pushed by republicans in the u.s. congress, but did not specifically endorse it.  trump is scheduled to dine at a washington hotel on thursday evening with members of the business council, a group of major u.s. company ceos, including immelt, goldman sachs’ lloyd blankfein and jp morgan chase’s jamie dimon.

" the mastermind of the “bridgegate” lane closure scandal that helped torpedo new jersey governor chris christie’s presidential bid should not be sentenced to prison due to his cooperation, u.s. prosecutors said in a court document filed on tuesday. david wildstein, who helped the government convict two former christie associates after he pleaded guilty in 2015, is set to be sentenced in federal court in newark on wednesday. wildstein, 55, admitted overseeing a scheme to shut down access lanes at the busy george washington bridge in 2013 to create massive traffic gridlock as punishment for a local democratic mayor who refused to endorse christie’s reelection campaign. u.s. prosecutors charged wildstein, former christie deputy chief of staff bridget kelly and a former executive of the port authority of new york and new jersey, bill baroni, with concocting the plot. the port authority supervises operations for the george washington bridge, which connects manhattan and new jersey and is one of the world’s busiest crossings.     christie, who has denied any involvement, was not charged. but the fallout dogged his bid for the republican nomination for president in 2016 and has contributed to his current record low approval rating of 15 percent in new jersey. wildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities, eventually appearing as the star witness at kelly and baroni’s trial for eight days of testimony. “put simply, were it not for wildstein’s decision to cooperate and disclose the true nature of the lane reductions, there likely would have been no prosecutions related to the bridge scheme,” u.s. prosecutors wrote in arguing that wildstein should receive probation but no prison time. kelly and baroni were sentenced to 1 1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. wildstein testified at trial that he and baroni joked with christie about the traffic jams caused by the lane closures as they were occurring, an assertion that christie and baroni both denied. he also told jurors that he and baroni used the port authority as a “goody bag” to dole out favors to local officials in exchange for support for christie’s re election. in a court submission made public on tuesday, wildstein’s lawyer also requested probation, noting that wildstein voluntarily met with investigators at the start of their probe. “mr. wildstein remains alone in taking responsibility for his role in the george washington bridge lane realignment issue, even though others were clearly involved,” alan zegas wrote.

" the obama administration told u.s. public schools on friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.  conservatives pushed back against the administration’s non binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender americans.  texas attorney general ken paxton said the guidance “must be challenged.” “if president obama thinks he can bully texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight,”  paxton, a tea party champion, said in a statement. other republican led states joined calls to disregard the white house’s directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. in north carolina, governor pat mccrory labeled the move a “massive executive branch overreach” and called on federal courts and the u.s. congress to intercede, while arkansas governor asa hutchinson said it was “offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense.” the u.s. education and justice departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. the guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the obama administration’s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid. the white house defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of “specific, tangible, real world advice and suggestions” that many schools had sought and will welcome. “that’s what we’re looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community.    the directive came as the justice department and north carolina are battling in federal court over a north carolina state law approved in march that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures. north carolina’s law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and tennessee and missouri considered similar measures. the letter to the schools from washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. that includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said. the american civil liberties union said the guidance would help make students “free to bring their whole selves to school.” in a sign of what defiant states may face, the justice department this week asked a u.s. district court in north carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 civil rights act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a reuters/ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. a group representing u.s. school boards called the guidance “unsettled law.” “a dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the congress,” the national school boards association said in a statement.  donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states.  “everybody has to be protected ... but it’s a tiny, tiny portion of the population,” trump told fox news.

" u.s. president donald trump signed an executive order on tuesday allowing the dakota access pipeline to go forward, after months of protests from native american groups and climate activists pushed the obama administration to ask for additional environmental review for the controversial project.  the u.s. army corps of engineers in december turned down the request for an easement for the dakota access pipeline to build under the missouri river. most of the pipeline has been constructed already, with the short stretch under the missouri river remaining unbuilt. the following is a timeline of the project: december 2014 energy transfer partners lp applies to the north dakota public service commission to build a 1,172 mile (1,885 km), 570,000 barrel per day pipeline to deliver crude oil from north dakota’s bakken shale fields to patoka, illinois, crossing south dakota and iowa, kicking off a year of public hearings in north dakota. january  north dakota regulators approve the pipeline unanimously. april 29 u.s. army corps of engineers holds a hearing for native americans on the pipeline.  july 25 the u.s. army corps of engineers approves three easements for water crossings for the pipeline at sakakawea, the mississippi river and lake oahe, which is an ancestral site for the standing rock sioux tribe.  july 27 the standing rock sioux tribe sues the army corps of engineers in u.s. district court for the district of columbia, citing violation of multiple federal statutes that authorize the pipeline’s construction and operation, and seeks an emergency order to halt construction. the tribe also alleges the pipeline threatens their environmental and economic well being and would damage and destroy sites of historic, religious and cultural significance. the sioux tribe say because the pipeline goes underneath lake oahe, approximately half a mile upstream of the tribe’s reservation, leaks from the pipeline would be directly in the tribe’s ancestral lands. sept. 3 private security guards hired by energy transfer partners use attack dogs and mace after violence erupted at a private construction site along the pipeline route. six people are reportedly bitten by dogs, a scene captured on video and broadcast widely. sept. 6 brian cladoosby, president of the national congress of american indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, speaks to nearly a dozen of president barack obama’s cabinet level advisers at a sept. 6 meeting of the white house’s three year old native american affairs council. cladoosby delivers an impassioned request: stand with native americans who have united with the standing rock sioux tribe and block construction of the dakota access pipeline.  sept. 9 u.s. district judge james boasberg in washington rejects a broad request from native americans to block the project. but herules that no construction activity on the dakota access may take place between highway 1806 and 20 miles to the east of lake oahe. construction activity to the west of highway 1806 may proceed. the tribe appeals the decision. sept. 9 less than an hour after boasberg’s decision, the u.s. justice and interior departments and army makes an unprecedented move and orders a stop to construction near lake oahe until the army corps of engineers reviews its previous decisions and decides if it needs to conduct a fuller environmental and cultural review. sept. 13 energy transfer partners tells employees in a letter, provided to media, that it is committed to completing the project, citing that the pipeline is 60 percent complete and that it has already spent $1.6 billion so far on equipment, materials and the workforce. oct. 9 the u.s. court of appeals of the district of columbia circuit says an administrative injunction related to the emergency motion of the standing rock tribe would be dissolved, citing that dakota access has rights to construct on private land up to lake oahe. oct. 11 environmental activists across four states disrupt the flow of millions of barrels of crude from canada into the united states in a rare, coordinate action that targets several key pipelines simultaneously. the protest group, the climate direct action, say their move is in support of the standing rock sioux tribe. as a safety precaution, companies operating the pipelines shut off sections of the lines for several hours while they investigate.  oct. 25 government to government tribal consultations begin across six regions on how federal government decision making on infrastructure projects could better include tribal concerns. nov. 8 energy transfer partners says it has built the pipe to the edge of lake oahe and reiterates its intentions to complete the project. nov. 9 following the surprise victory of donald trump in the u.s. presidential election, climate activists and the standing rock sioux say they still hope president obama will be able to kill the pipeline definitively. analysts say the line is more than likely to go through. nov. 14 the u.s. government, in a joint notice issued by the department of the interior and the army corps of engineers, delays a final decision on permitting. they say the permit had followed all legal requirements, but more consultation with native american tribes is needed. nov. 18 energy transfer partners’ ceo kelcy warren tells the associated press that the pipeline would not be re routed.  nov. 20 about 400 activists gather on a bridge between the camp protest and the construction path; law enforcement officers respond by using tear gas and water cannons on them in freezing temperatures.  nov. 26 the u.s. army corps of engineers tells protesters they need to leave the oceti sakowin camp, the primary protest camp located on federal land, by dec. 5. they later say they have no plans to enforce this order. nov. 28  north dakota governor jack dalrymple issues an evacuation order for the oceti sakowin camp, citing harsh weather on the way. officials the next day tell reuters they plan on blockading the camp so supplies cannot get in. they later back off that plan and say they may just issue fines, but retreat from that idea as well. nov. 30 a group of u.s. veterans announce they will bring more than 2,000 service members to north dakota to stand as human shields between the protesters and law enforcement. they begin arriving over the next several days. dec. 4 the u.s. army corps of engineers denies energy transfer partners’ request for an easement to run under lake oahe, sparking a celebration amongst protesters. etp says it will continue to fight for the line. the incoming trump administration has said it supports dakota access, along with other pipeline projects. jan. 18  the army corps says it will publish a notice in the federal register stating its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for the easement at lake oahe. etp files a motion asking a court to bar the action in an effort to move the pipeline forward. jan. 24 president trump, who previously owned stock in energy transfer partners, signs an order aimed at moving the pipeline, along with an unrelated pipeline, keystone xl, to go forward.

" a u.s. congresswoman urged the labor department on monday to investigate chipotle mexican grill for possible wage theft, another potential hurdle for the burrito chain as it seeks to rebound from food safety problems last year. u.s. representative rosa delauro, a democrat from connecticut, said the department should probe allegations from about 10,000 current and former chipotle employees who have joined a federal lawsuit that alleges the company did not properly pay them for hours worked. such actions, if true, would contradict federal law, delauro said in a letter to the department, “depriving workers of the wages and earnings to which they are legally entitled.” chipotle said her call for an investigation was “misdirected.” “we have maintained from the outset that this case is without merit and will vigorously defend our employment practices,” company spokesman chris arnold said. the labor department had no immediate comment. chipotle has been working to revive sales growth after outbreaks of e. coli, norovirus and salmonella linked to its restaurants sickened more than 500 people last year and drove away customers. last week, activist investor william ackman disclosed that his hedge fund had purchased a 9.9 percent stake in the company, saying it was undervalued. the case over unpaid wages began two years ago when leah turner, who worked as a manager at a chipotle restaurant in colorado, alleged in a lawsuit that the company routinely required hourly paid employees to work “off the clock,” according to court records.  the company used timekeeping devices that automatically punched employees off the clock, even if they were still working, the lawsuit said. since then, about 10,000 others from across the country have joined the lawsuit seeking to recover unpaid wages, said andrew quisenberry, an attorney representing the workers for law firm bachus & schanker. the large number of plaintiffs is “significant to us, showing that it’s widespread across chipotle,” quisenberry said. the case is tuner et al vs chipotle mexican grill, u.s. district court, district of colorado, no. 14 cv 02612.

" swedish prosecutors accused democratic republic of congo s government on wednesday of not cooperating with their investigation into the murder of a u.n. sanctions monitor from sweden. zaida catalan and her american colleague, michael sharp, were shot dead in march and found in a shallow grave in an area of central congo where they had been gathering information on a conflict between the army and a militia. congo s government has arrested more than a dozen people in connection with the killings, which it blames on the militia   though one report to the u.n. security council suggested state security services could also be involved. the swedish prosecution authority launched its own investigation into catalan s death, and said on wednesday it had received no response to a request it made in april for information from congolese authorities.  the swedish investigation is facing severe difficulties given the fact that it is completely reliant on evidence that exists in the congo and cooperation is not working with congo,  prosecutor sara nilsson said in the statement. material that swedish authorities had managed to collect  does not exclude that persons who have close ties to the regime in congo are involved in the murders,  the authority added. in april, congo s government screened a video to reporters, which it said showed members of the militia killing catalan and sharp. but analysts said the grainy footage raised more questions than it answered and nilsson told reuters the screening had tainted important evidence.  congo s government spokesman lambert mende has denied congolese officials were involved in the murders and said on wednesday that it was up to swedish authorities to provide information to the congolese court hearing the case, not the other way around.  justice is rendered here because the crime was committed here,  mende said.  if they have information that the court might not be able to access, they should give it to the court.  the conflict in kasai region between congo s army and the kamuina nsapu militia has killed as many as 5,000 people and displaced around 1.5 million more since august last year.  the united nations has repeatedly accused congolese forces of using excessive force and targeting civilians with alleged ties to the militia. the government denies those charges.

" a senior u.s. senator said on friday that he expects congress’ investigation of russia and the 2016 u.s. election to go ahead, even after the appointment of a special counsel, and said congress has a broader mandate that extends to financial conflicts of interest. the u.s. justice department on wednesday appointed robert mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign and possible collusion between trump’s campaign and russia. “the congress has a broader oversight responsibility than just whether crimes have been committed,” senator ron wyden, the ranking democrat on the senate finance committee and a senior member of the senate intelligence committee, said during a round table meeting with reuters.  the senate intelligence committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes of the issue. “bob mueller doesn’t have, for example, the same broader responsibility to get into the kind of financial entanglements that i have especially focused on,” wyden said. questions remain about what contacts took place between trump advisers and the russians, and about russia investments in trump businesses.  in march, for example, the white house disclosed that trump’s son in law and white house senior adviser, jared kushner, met executives of russian state development bank vnesheconombank, or veb, in december. in february, trump’s national security adviser, michael flynn, was forced to resign for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak, russia’s ambassador to the united states, and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations. reuters reported on thursday that flynn and other advisers to trump’s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race. u.s. intelligence agencies said russia hacked emails of senior democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the 2016 u.s. presidential election in favor of trump, whose views were seen as more in line with moscow’s. russia has denied the allegations. trump has dismissed suggestions of links with moscow as democratic sour grapes for losing the election. trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with russia. mueller’s appointment raised questions about whether he would ask congress to step away from its investigation, or whether the dual track would complicate issues such as calling witnesses or obtaining documents. some congressional republicans have also suggested that mueller’s appointment would lead to changes in congress’ investigation. wyden said he would “go to the mat” to be sure congressional investigators get what they need. he has already put a hold on trump’s nomination of sigal mandelker to the position of under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence until treasury hands over all documents related to financial dealings between russia, trump and trump associates. wyden also said he was looking into ways to obtain documents related to dealings with russia by flynn. the intelligence committee subpoenaed flynn for the documents on may 10. his lawyer said on thursday that flynn had not yet decided how to respond. wyden said he needed time to decide how to respond, but pledged he would do so. “we still have to know more ... about how russia corrupted our democracy,” he said. he said he knew that it would involve the department of justice.

" u.s. senator elizabeth warren on thursday urged the justice department’s top antitrust official to recuse himself from an ongoing review of at&t inc’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of time warner inc. she urged assistant attorney general for antitrust makan delrahim, who was confirmed late last month, not to take part in the review because of his previous statement that the merger did not pose a “major antitrust problem.”  “your refusal to recuse yourself will undermine public confidence in the division’s ability to reach an unbiased final decision in the matter,” warren wrote in the letter. warren’s concern over the deal is based on the fact that at&t already owns directv, which means that the proposed transaction would combine the biggest pay tv provider with a major u.s. content provider. time warner’s stable of content includes the premium cable channel hbo, tnt and news channel cnn, among others. at&t said last month it plans to reinvest more advertising revenue into content as it goes head to head with online streaming services such as netflix inc. at&t declined to comment and has said it hopes to complete the transaction by the end of the year. the justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

" italy s anti establishment 5 star movement, which leads most opinion polls ahead of a national election due by may next year, on friday launched an internal ballot to choose its leader and candidate for prime minister. the hot favorite is 31 year old lower house deputy luigi di maio, the party s most high profile and popular politician, who has made no secret of wanting the job and appears to have no rivals to worry him. the biggest problem for the maverick movement founded eight years ago may be finding credible alternative candidates in the contest, which will take the form of an online vote of 5 star s members, in line with its credo of direct democracy. di maio, who is deputy speaker of the chamber of deputies, is considered a good communicator and one of 5 star s more moderate figures. a post on 5 star s official mouthpiece, the blog of its founder beppe grillo, said the candidate for prime minister would also be the party s leader, something which is not always the case in italian politics. grillo, who founded 5 star in 2009, has so far acted as its de facto chief, though he has never run for any office and the party has always prided itself as having a horizontal structure with no official leader. the only person considered a realistic threat to di maio, the fiery deputy alessandro di battista, has given no indication that he plans to run. another deputy seen as a potential challenger, roberto fico, who represents the left wing of the party and has recently distanced himself from di maio s tough positions on law and order and immigration, has also not yet made any move. the post on grillo s blog said 5 star s local and national representatives who wish to run had until monday to present their candidacies. the timing of the online vote has not yet been set but the winner is due to be announced on sept 23 at 5 star s annual national meeting at the adriatic coastal town of rimini.

" republican presidential candidate donald trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration might not trigger the surge in latino voter turnout for which many activists are hoping, according to a pew research center survey released on tuesday. about 89 percent of latino registered voters who were surveyed said they planned to vote in the nov. 8 election, down from 91 percent who said in october 2012 that they were planning to vote in that year’s election. the decrease was within the survey’s plus or minus 4.6 percent margin of error. the pew report was based on a bilingual telephone survey of 1,507 latino adults, including 804 registered voters, from aug. 23 through sept. 21.  in july 2008, four months before the presidential election that year, 94 percent of respondents said they planned to vote. according to previous pew research, about 81.7 percent of hispanic registered voters cast ballots in 2012, the year  democratic president barack obama ran successfully against republican mitt romney. that turnout was down from 84 percent in 2008, when obama ran against republican john mccain and won. the latest pew survey found that democrats continued to maintain an edge as the party “more concerned” for latinos.  hillary clinton is relying on a coalition of minority voters to help her against trump, who launched his presidential bid last year by calling some mexican immigrants rapists and promising to build a wall to stop them entering the united states. latinos, a growing segment of the u.s. electorate with rising influence in closely fought states like florida and nevada, tend to lean democratic and favor clinton heavily over trump. according to the survey, some 58 percent support clinton compared to 19 percent for trump. another 10 percent favor libertarian candidate gary johnson and 6 percent prefer green candidate jill stein.  turnout among latinos tends to run well below that of whites and african americans, blunting their impact in political races.  a number of civic groups opposed to trump have been working to ensure latinos get to the polls.  pew said that 27.3 million latinos were eligible to vote. however, knowing how many of those people are registered is harder to measure because many states do not capture information such as race or ethnicity along with voter registration information.  in 2012 an estimated 11.2 million latinos voted in the presidential election, according to pew. in 2008 that figure was 9.7 million latino voters. while one must be a u.s. citizen to cast a ballot in u.s.  elections, requirements for voter registration can vary by state.  immigrants’ rights group america’s voice, for example, launched a new spanish language radio ad in miami and orlando for the next two weeks bashing trump’s hardline immigration proposals, which include deporting all undocumented foreigners and making it harder for would be immigrants to get visas. in nevada, the culinary union, which is heavily latino, is working to ensure its members get to the polls, helping them with logistics like finding their polling stations and arranging transport. “it could make the difference between a one point loss and a one point win,” said yvanna cancela, the union’s political director. sergio garcia rios, a professor of latino studies at cornell university, said clinton could be missing an opportunity to drive voter turnout further by not engaging latino voters enough on policy. “we can’t just rely on an anger reaction to donald trump,” he said. the challenge is “to create enthusiasm for latinos to get out and vote.”   ",0
" u.s. house democratic leader nancy pelosi said the obama administration may announce as early as thursday that it is shifting more money into fighting the zika virus. “maybe today or tomorrow,” pelosi told reporters in a hallway on thursday. she did not give an amount, but said, “i think they are going to try to do it a piece at a time, hoping that something else will happen,” an apparent reference to the administration’s request that the republican led congress approve a funding bill to combat the virus. the obama administration in february requested $1.9 billion to fight the virus, which was first detected in brazil last year and has spread rapidly in the americas. before going home on summer recess, lawmakers were discussing a $1.1 billion measure, but the bill stalled amid partisan bickering. house democrats at a news conference urged the republicans to reconvene congress to address the virus. florida is grappling with at least 21 cases of locally transmitted zika, and the obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million to fight the virus. but the centers for disease control and prevention will spend all of its remaining funds by the end of september, while two other agencies will exhaust their resources for zika by the end of august, representative rosa delauro said. money will have to be shifted from biomedical research to fight zika, delauro said. “if they don’t, vaccine development will be stopped dead in its tracks,” she said.

" german chancellor angela merkel praised her veteran finance minister at a party in his honor on monday, as a potential coalition partner laid claim to his job as their price for supporting her in power. speaking at wolfgang schaeuble s 75th birthday celebration, merkel paid tribute to his 45 years as a member of parliament, but gave no clear signal that she wanted to retain him in the post after a national election on sunday that she is on track to win.  we re fighting together at the moment to ensure there are at least four more years,  merkel told attendees at the event hosted by her christian democrats (cdu) in offenburg, in his constituency in the southwestern state of baden wuerttemberg. in a wheelchair since a deranged man shot him at an election campaign event a few days after german reunification in 1990, schaeuble lives for his job and has made abundantly clear he would relish another run as finance minister. but his fate may rest in the hands of the parties merkel ends up governing with. on monday, the pro business free democrats (fdp), regarded as a natural ally of her conservatives, made a play for his ministry in exchange for joining the next coalition.  the fdp should enter no government in which it cannot name a finance minister,  alexander hahn, a member of the party s national executive, told mass market daily bild. the fdp is still haunted by its decision not to take the finance ministry in 2009 at the start of merkel s second term   a move that backfired as schaeuble quashed the fdp s plans for tax cuts, alienating its pro business supporters who then booted it out of parliament in 2013. the fdp has reinvented itself with a hard line on europe and its leader has voiced concerns that merkel and french president emmanuel macron plan to strengthen the euro zone by creating a system of financial transfers between states. schaeuble, who is the face of german austerity and has insisted that eu countries adhere to europe s budget rules, could help merkel keep conservative voters and lawmakers on board as they press ahead with deeper euro zone integration. horst seehofer, leader of merkel s bavarian sister party, the christian social union (csu), said he favoured a tie up with the fdp.  i quite clearly hope for a black yellow coalition,  he told the handelsblatt daily referring to the parties  colors. the fdp is currently polling well above the 5 percent threshold it will have to cross to re enter parliament on sunday, but surveys suggest it and merkel s conservatives will probably need a third partner to secure a majority. the chancellor may yet find herself resuming the current grand coalition with the center left social democrats (spd), whose leader martin schulz accused her of personally blocking measures proposed by his party to improve the situation of families with small and medium incomes. during a town hall style ard television interview, he said merkel would start to roll back social policy reforms after the election if she was able to form a conservatives/fdp coalition.  they want to abolish the law to limit rent increases. and then the property market will go through the roof,  he said.     the far right alternative for germany (afd), which is expected to enter parliament for the first time, meanwhile beefed up its anti immigration rhetoric.  germany has become a safe haven for criminals and terrorists from all over the world because thanks to a lack of border checks it s easy to get in,  top afd candidate alice weidel said in berlin. merkel, who was dressed in the conservatives  black and the fdp s yellow, paid tribute to schaeuble as a european, a fighter for german unity, a passionate parliamentarian and an intellectual force who kept calm in hectic situations. but she also wished him time to spend with his family and try out new things, as she presented him with the complete works of dietrich bonhoeffer, a german pastor and theologian known for his opposition to the nazis.  we wish you a good read, new insights, all the best and, in the name of the cdu and from me personally, dear wolfgang schaeuble, many heartfelt thanks,  merkel said.

"sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and his wife, jane sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys, amid an fbi investigation into a loan jane sanders obtained to expand burlington college while she was its president, cbs news confirms.politico magazine first reported the sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in the probe. sanders top adviser jeff weaver told cbs news the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents  allegations from a january 2016 complaint accusing then-president of burlington college, ms. sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from people s united bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.according to politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that sen. sanders  office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.heat street  when jane o meara sanders served as president of burlington college between 2004 and 2011, she oversaw an aggressive effort to enroll more students and expand the campus to accommodate a bigger student body. part of that plan: taking out hefty loans to finance the $10 million purchase of 32 acres of prime property from the roman catholic diocese at the end of 2010.but burlington college soon found itself unable to make its loan payments. the roman catholic diocese, which had sold off the land to help pay for a $17 million sexual-abuse settlement, ultimately lost between $1.5 million and $2 million, according to the letter calling for investigation, as well as several vermont media outlets. the diocese did not respond to a request for an interview. but a source with direct knowledge of the diocese s involvement in the land acquisition says burlington college almost immediately struggled to meet its obligations. it was within a relatively short time after closing [the deal], they were experiencing financial problems that made it impossible to pay the diocese,  the source says, adding that burlington soon went into default mode on its loan.parishioners now say that to secure loans to buy the land, ms. sanders misrepresented the amount that had been pledged to the college in its fundraising push.the request for investigation notes that defrauding a bank is a federal crime; it s punishable by up to 30 years in prison and $1 million in fines, according to federal code. watch sanders rail against inequality and corruption at his commencement speech to the 2017 graduating class at brooklyn college: ms. sanders  push for the liberal arts college s costly land acquisition was cited in a press release by the college when it shut down in 2016. and as for the claim that ms. sanders manipulated the loan application, weaver  said,  the loan was approved by the financial board at the college. sen. sanders, formerly mayor of burlington, vermont s largest city, regards the claims as a political game levied against him after his run for president in the 2016 primary election, a platform which has transformed the small-state senator into an influential voice in american liberal politics.   cbs news ",1
" there is at least one approved device and scores of experimental treatments being tested that could improve the odds of longer term survival for patients with the type of extremely aggressive brain cancer afflicting u.s. senator john mccain. while the 80 year old arizona republican, who was re elected to a sixth senate term in november, recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot found to be associated with the cancer, he and his medical team will explore treatment options. “that (recovery) usually takes about 10 to 14 days before starting therapy,” said dr. maciej lesniak, chair of neurological surgery at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago. mccain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a brain cancer with very poor prognosis that took the life of former u.s. senator edward kennedy in 2009. surgery is performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible, but cancer cells are left behind that infiltrate the brain and quickly grow. the survival rate with standard treatment is generally about 15 months, with only about 25 percent of patients alive after two years. standard treatment is a combination of 30 doses of radiation administered over six weeks along with the oral chemotherapy temodar (temozolomide) sold by merck & co (mrk.n). after a three to four week break, additional four week cycles of temodar are given. mccain has vowed to return to his senate duties soon. experts said he may well be able to do so.  the treatment is usually very well tolerated, lesniak said. “generally, people can maintain normal quality of life during therapy including their work in the majority of cases.” doctors interviewed who are not involved in mccain’s care said further combination therapies were likely needed to sharply improve patient outcomes. debates over when to begin such  therapies are ongoing. “many people feel we need to push the envelope and look at combination therapy as early as possible in addition to the standard of care,” lesniak said.  there are about 150 clinical trials for glioblastoma under way, most at very early stages, and the majority for patients for whom initial therapy has stopped working. mccain could be a candidate for a trial in newly diagnosed patients.  current immunotherapies that have shown great promise against melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers are unlikely by themselves to work in glioblastoma because the tumors tend not to present the proper target for those drugs. “glioblastoma tumor cells are incredibly heterogeneous. no two tumor cells are alike,” said dr. john de groot, professor of neuro oncology at the university of texas md anderson cancer center, adding that a multi pronged approach was likely needed. one promising approach being tested in early stage clinical trials by various institutions and companies involve injecting viruses into the tumor to destroy cancer cells and spur an immune system attack. duke university generated publicity last year with reports of early success using the polio virus against brain cancer. md anderson developed a viral therapy that it outlicensed to a company called dnatrix for further development, de groot said. a trial at northwestern is using neural stem cells to help improve the performance of a cancer fighting virus. “stem cells when loaded with the virus can travel to areas we can’t resect to deliver the virus throughout the tumor mass in a more uniform fashion,” lesniak said. in a study published in may in the journal nature, duke researchers reported early success with a vaccine that delivers high doses of temodar to the tumor. among 11 patients in that study, the median survival was 41.1 months, versus 14.6 months for the standard treatment. dr. roger stupp, co director of the northwestern brain tumor institute, who is credited with pioneering the radiation/temodar combination therapy for glioblastoma, said patients like mccain might be helped by a now approved device shown to extend survival. called optune and sold by novocure ltd (nvcr.o), it  delivers an electromagnetic field that interferes with cancer cells’ ability to divide and survive, said stupp, who led trials of the device. it involves electrodes placed on the scalp operated by a small battery pack. with optune worn nearly 24 hours a day, the two year survival rate in the trial that led to its approval jumped to 43 percent, with some patients living four years or more. “my recommendation is to use it early in the disease course,” stupp said.

" there are signs the u.s. government is taking a more flexible view of how to pay for its planned border wall with mexico, and new meetings to craft future bilateral relations could take place soon, a top mexican official said on monday. those ties were shaken last week when a planned summit between u.s. president donald trump and mexican president enrique pena nieto was canceled after the american said it was better to forgo it if mexico was unwilling to pay for the wall. trump wants a wall on the u.s. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and says mexico will pay for it. mexico has flatly refused, making the issue a point of national pride. pena nieto and trump spoke by telephone to calm tensions on friday, and mexican foreign minister luis videgaray said the two administrations were in close contact and would talk this week. “dialogue has not broken off,” he said. “it’s an extraordinarily important relationship for mexico.” while no date has been set for a new pena nieto trump summit, meetings between government officials are possible in the next few days, said videgaray, who expressed confidence that the white house was modifying its view on payment of the wall. white house chief of staff reince priebus said on sunday that payment for the wall was still under discussion, mentioning the possibility of a border tax and other fiscal measures. “it could be on drug cartels,” priebus added on cbs’ “face the nation.” “and it could be on people that are coming here illegally and paying fines. or it could be all of the above.” while cautioning he had no details of what those plans could involve, videgaray was heartened by the comments. “i think it’s a welcome sign, at least i interpret it that way, that we’re seeing the rhetoric is changing,” he said. the minister said “a very sizeable part” of the business done by drug gangs was in the united states. trump has threatened to ditch the north american free trade agreement binding mexico, the united states and canada, and mexico’s government wants to defend its access to the u.s. market by bringing migration and security into discussions. in a separate video statement on monday, pena nieto promised to better protect migrants north of the border, by channeling over 1 billion pesos ($48.16 million) into mexican consulates in the united states.  the comments came after videgaray said the country’s fresh steps to support mexicans living in the united states were not aimed at obstructing law enforcement there.     mexico announced some measures, such as expanding the availability of mobile consulate services to reach more migrants in november, after trump’s surprise win.

" movement on a bipartisan deal to end illinois’ record budget impasse halted on wednesday with the democratic head of the state senate pinning the blame on republican governor bruce rauner. the senate had been scheduled to continue voting on a package of legislation negotiated by senate president john cullerton and republican leader christine radogno in an effort to end illinois’ 20 month budget stalemate. the chamber passed some of the bills on tuesday. but cullerton told the chamber on wednesday that rauner “decided to inject himself in this process and doesn’t want this approved in this form,” a move, he said, that removed republican votes for the bills. “for now we are in a holding pattern,” cullerton said, adding that the chamber would be ready to start voting again “as soon as we get word there is republican support.” rauner spokeswoman catherine kelly said while some progress has been made, “more work is needed to achieve a good deal for taxpayers.” although the governor has not been involved in the senate negotiations, his proposed fiscal 2018 budget incorporates aspects of the deal to fill a funding gap. illinois, the nation’s fifth largest state, is limping through a record setting second consecutive fiscal year without a complete budget due to an ongoing feud between rauner and democrats who control the legislature. a six month fiscal 2017 budget expired on dec. 31. the state’s pile of unpaid bills has mushroomed to $12 billion, while its unfunded pension liability has climbed to $130 billion. as a result, illinois’ credit ratings, which have been downgraded six times since january 2015, are the lowest among the 50 states. the senate’s bipartisan legislative package includes bills to complete the fiscal 2017 budget, hike taxes, cut pension costs by about $1 billion annually, authorize borrowing to pay down the bill pile, expand casino gaming and freeze local property taxes.  all of the bills are tied to each other, so that if one failed to pass the entire package would go down. while cullerton expressed frustration with the governor’s action during a post session press conference, radogno was more optimistic.  “i know the governor will be joining us to get in trying to get that done,” she said on the senate floor. “we need to get this done and done soon.” ",0

benchmarks again. the performances in part reflect broader weaknesses in the investing climate. the last 15 months have been difficult for many portfolio managers amid volatile stock markets, tumbling oil and commodity prices, and an economic slowdown in china. trump defended his holdings in an interview with reuters, saying he invested in the funds three or four years ago and they have done well over time. “i put some money with people that are friends,” the new york businessman said by phone on monday, without naming names. “i have no idea if they are up or down. i just know that they have been very good over a period of time,” added trump, the front runner for the republican nomination for the november presidential election. representatives for baron, blackrock and paulson declined to comment. to be sure, some of trump’s funds have performed well this year. for instance, gabelli funds’ gamco global gold, natural resources & income fund, a closed end vehicle, has gained 16.27 percent through march 22, beating a benchmark return of 15.89 percent for natural resource funds, according to net asset value data from morningstar. another fund that trump has invested in, the invesco european growth fund, gained 4.82 percent last year versus a benchmark loss of 5.66 percent, according to morningstar. gabelli and invesco declined to comment. both funds are listed as small holdings within trump’s broader brokerage accounts.     the 21 funds examined by reuters were among 23 funds that trump disclosed last year in a july 15 filing with the federal election commission. the performance of two of the funds could not be discerned. the reuters review included performance data publicly disclosed by 14 mutual funds, as well as performance data on seven hedge funds seen in confidential fund reports or shared by people familiar with those firms. trump told reuters the funds are a tiny part of his investment portfolio. “i do very little hedge funds business. i for the most part don’t believe in it,” he said. the 23 funds were worth as much as $120.75 million, according to the fec filing, a fraction of trump’s self proclaimed net worth of more than $10 billion.  while trump selected the funds, their managers are responsible for choosing securities to invest in and the funds’ subsequent performance.  some investing experts who looked at trump’s portfolio and reuters’ compilation of their performance were not impressed, saying he could have earned better returns by investing in other hedge funds.  for instance, reuters previously reported that millennium management’s main millennium international fund gained 12.65 percent in 2015, while citadel gained 14.3 percent in its main multi strategy hedge funds. “by the looks of it, mr. trump’s investing prowess is very pedestrian,” said brian shapiro, chief executive of simplify llc, which tracks and analyses alternative investments like hedge funds. “for someone who prides himself on being surrounded by the best talent,” added brad alford, an investment advisor and ceo of alpha capital management, “i’m surprised to see so few winners.”  to be sure, some of trump’s funds that fell in 2015 have fared better in previous years. for instance, blackrock’s obsidian fund has averaged annual returns of 3.39 percent over the last five years, according to a person familiar with the performance. obsidian fell 6.17 percent in 2016 through march 11, while other comparable funds rose 0.69 percent, according to a private client report by hsbc’s alternative investment group seen by reuters. blackrock declined to comment. “you can’t measure it in a short time. i’m way up with blackrock. i’m way up with obsidian,” trump told reuters, without elaborating further.  trump disclosed a $27.6 million stake in obsidian in may 2015, his largest fund holding. it is unclear when trump first invested in obsidian, which bets on corporate and government bonds, along with interest rates and other securities.  obsidian was burned by a slide in oil and other commodities, according to a february blackrock client note seen by reuters. trump’s stable of funds include two angelo, gordon & co hedge funds, three paulson & co hedge funds, and 11 baron capital mutual funds. the mutual funds are open to virtually anyone, but hedge funds are only accessible to those that meet minimum wealth requirements, which typically include a net worth of more than $1 million. a representative for angelo, gordon & co did not respond to a request for comment. baron’s billionaire founder, ron baron, is known for long term bets on companies and an optimistic world view. trump uses 11 baron vehicles with different investment strategies, including small cap stocks, real estate and emerging markets. nine of the funds lost money in 2015, with one energy and resources vehicle falling nearly 32 percent, according to data compiled by morningstar. nine are down this year through march 22 with single digit losses.   baron’s long term track record is better. the firm’s best known baron growth fund has gained an average of about 8.6 percent annually over the last five years.  paulson’s funds have produced a mixed performance in recent years. led by new york billionaire john paulson, the firm became famous for its prescient bet on the collapse of the subprime mortgage market leading up to the financial crisis.  but in 2015, the three paulson funds used by trump all fell, according to data provided by an investor to reuters. one of the funds, the paulson advantage plus fund, had declined an average of about 22 percent every year over the last five years, according to a confidential fund report seen by reuters. trump's filing to the fec lists myriad business ventures, including holdings in hotels and golf properties, as well as individual stocks such as apple inc, goldman sachs and altria group. (click here ) trump told reuters his stock picks have done well recently. “i bought them low and i sold them high,” he said, referring to a series of sales in january 2014 that netted more than $27 million.  “it was very good timing,” he added. “i hit the market exactly perfectly.” ",0
" the top democrat on the u.s. house of representatives armed services committee announced his opposition on wednesday to the 2017 defense authorization bill, underscoring the partisan divide over the $602 billion defense policy measure. representative adam smith said changes in the bill this week by republicans, who control the house, on issues including women’s registration for the draft, transfers from the guantanamo detention center and protection for gay and transgender employees of military contractors, had led him to oppose it. “these have tipped the balance of the bill considerably,” smith said in a statement. president barack obama had already threatened to veto the house version of the national defense authorization act, or ndaa, over a long list of issues, starting with its use of $18 billion of special war funds for day to day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. this week, the powerful house rules committee used a procedural move to remove, without a house vote, an amendment approved by the armed services committee that would have required women to register for the military draft. the rules panel also decided not to allow debate on an amendment that would have stripped a “religious protection” measure from the bill that rights advocates fear would undo the president’s 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity. smith said he also objected to republicans’ adding further restrictions on transfers from the military prison in guantanamo bay, cuba, and reduction in funds for nuclear nonproliferation and other provisions. republicans control 246 seats in the 435 member house, which passed the bill by a vote of 277 147 late on wednesday, largely along party lines, with most republicans backing the bill and most democrats opposed. however, the senate will pass its own version of the bill later this year, which will be reconciled with the house bill to create a final version of the legislation. once passed by the senate and house, that ndaa would be sent to the white house for obama to sign into law, or veto.

" donald trump was not in the room during u.s. president barack obama’s final state of the union speech, but the republican presidential front runner was a looming presence nonetheless.  both obama’s speech on tuesday and, for that matter, the republican response by south carolina governor nikki haley, took pains to rebuke trump, the real estate billionaire whose red hot rhetoric has endeared him to some and dismayed others in the campaign for the nov. 8 presidential election. obama and haley, although from different parties, offered a defense of establishment politics, a plea for optimism and a quest for common ground. obama seemed to refer specifically to trump’s call for a temporary ban on muslim immigration following a deadly shooting attack last month in san bernardino, california, by a couple authorities said had been radicalized. “we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. this isn’t a matter of political correctness,” obama said. trump has mounted much of his insurgent candidacy on the notion of america losing ground, both economically and in terms of global influence. obama rejected that idea outright.  “it’s easier to be cynical,” obama said, “to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.” soon after obama concluded his remarks in the chamber of the house of representatives, trump tweeted: “the state of the union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non substantive i have heard in a long time.” while consistently criticizing obama’s record, haley, the daughter of indian immigrants and a potential republican vice presidential choice, also seemed to indict trump’s message. “some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,” she said. “that is just not true. often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. when the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. and that can make a world of difference.” like obama, haley did not mention trump by name during her address but she criticized him in an interview on nbc’s “today show” on wednesday while calling on the republican party to be more inclusive. “mr. trump has definitely contributed to what i think is just irresponsible talk,” she said. trump responded shortly afterward by telling fox news that haley has been “very weak on illegal immigration” for a long time. paul sracic, chairman of the politics department at youngstown state university in ohio, said trump was dominating “our political discourse in a way that no one would have predicted even a year ago.” “donald trump must be smiling tonight,” he said, pointing out that the candidate managed to make himself the target of not just the state of the union address, but also the republican response. the white house gave haley credit for defending “american values” in her speech. “she was willing to do something that a lot of other republicans   leading republicans   have been unwilling to do,” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters on wednesday.  but he stressed that the administration disagrees with many of haley’s positions. obama flew on wednesday to nebraska, a republican “red state,” to promote the big picture ideas he laid out in his speech.  on tuesday night, obama also appeared to single out conservative texas senator ted cruz, the top challenger to trump in the republican race. cruz has called for a massive bombing campaign in iraq and syria to wipe out islamic state forces. meeting the threat of islamic state, obama said, “needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.” democratic strategist brad bannon said obama “made the argument very well that leadership is not bombing the crap out of someone.”  cruz quickly countered in a statement. obama, he said, “lectures us on civility yet he has been one of the most divisive presidents in american history.” both trump and cruz, who are topping opinion polls weeks before the early nomination contests in iowa and new hampshire, have pledged to push the republican party in a more confrontational direction, and seek to undo much of what obama has accomplished as president. both candidates are likely in coming days to hammer the obama administration on its approach to islamic state.     obama’s defense of pragmatic politics may also help his former secretary of state, hillary clinton, who is trying to stave off a challenge from self described democratic socialist bernie sanders in the democratic presidential contest, said bannon.  “he’s taking about holding up the establishment,” he said. “when the president makes a good case, it helps hillary more than bernie.” but john geer, an expert on voter opinion at vanderbilt university, thought obama, in his bid for unity, damaged clinton’s prospects by not making a stronger case for  continuing the democratic agenda. “he didn’t put forward an argument why there should be another democrat for four years,” geer said. “i think she would have liked to see that.”     ",0
" president enrique pena nieto on wednesday replaced his close ally and finance minister, luis videgaray, after the two were heavily criticized for republican u.s presidential candidate donald trump’s controversial visit to mexico last week. a somber looking pena nieto told a news conference that videgaray, who officials said was the architect of trump’s visit, would make way for former finance minister jose antonio meade. pena nieto was widely pilloried for hosting trump at short notice last wednesday. the new york businessman has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants   which he said mexico would pay for. trump has further infuriated mexicans by threatening to carry out mass deportations and rewrite trade treaties crucial to their economy, and by referring to some immigrants from the united states’ southern neighbor as rapists or drug runners with economic growth sluggish, the president’s popularity at record lows and tensions palpable between the finance minister and other cabinet members, rumors of videgaray’s impending departure had bubbled under the surface in mexico for months. “the proverbial last straw was the trump visit,” said agustin barrios gomez, a politician from the opposition leftist party of the democratic revolution, and a driving force behind a draft bill sent to congress this week to empower the government to retaliate against trump if he threatens mexican interests. “(it) was seen as such a fiasco that he no longer had the credibility necessary to do his immediate job,” he added. senior diplomats said videgaray, 48, had been instrumental in arranging the american’s visit, in which the government had hoped to impress upon trump the need to moderate his tone and reconsider his more divisive campaign proposals. but within hours of leaving mexico, trump was telling a cheering crowd of supporters in arizona that mexico would pay for the border wall “100 percent,” prompting fresh ridicule of pena nieto at home. instead of teaching trump a lesson, the visit “legitimized him as a potential head of state,” said andres rozental, a former deputy mexican foreign minister. “it just shows how little thought went into it.” trump commented on the resignation during a forum with u.s. veterans on nbc television when he was asked if the united states could take a chance with him as commander in chief. “well, i think absolutely,” he said. “i think if you saw what happened in mexico the other day...i let them know where the united states stands. i mean, we’ve been badly hurt by mexico...and if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in mexico have been forced out of government. that’s how well we did.” videgaray ran pena nieto’s election campaign, and was long regarded as the most powerful cabinet minister, with a huge influence on policy after orchestrating the country’s landmark energy, telecommunications, tax and education reforms. both men were embroiled in conflict of interest scandals in late 2014, after pena nieto’s wife and videgaray were found to have acquired property from a major government contractor. pena nieto ordered an inquiry, which cleared both of any wrongdoing. the respected new finance minister, meade, is a friend of videgaray and had started in the administration as foreign minister before moving to the social development ministry. videgaray’s departure from the cabinet means interior minister miguel angel osorio chong, on whose watch capo joaquin “el chapo” guzman escaped from prison before being recaptured, is now the most visible potential presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling institutional revolutionary party, or pri. polls show the main hopefuls for 2018 face a tough battle, with osorio chong leading prospective pri contenders. meade, who was also once energy minister, is among those hopefuls. he must now steer next year’s budget through congress, with the draft plan to be announced on thursday. senator ernesto cordero, a former finance minister from the center right opposition, said he expected a smooth handover to meade, whose experience in government he underlined. “he’s been a minister five times, and on those five occasions he’s done a good job,” cordero said. the economy has consistently fallen short of government growth forecasts during videgaray’s tenure, and contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years. the new budget will be under close scrutiny after rating agency standard & poor’s last month said it could cut mexico’s credit rating following a marked increase in debt. videgaray, who has also been rumored as a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate for the pri in the state of mexico, a populous region next to the capital, will not take another public post, a finance ministry spokeswoman said.

" robert michel, a gentlemanly midwesterner who championed civility in washington as house republican leader but left congress dismayed by the rise of conservative firebrands in his own party, died on friday at age 93, a former aide said. michel died at the virginia hospital center in arlington, virginia, where he had been admitted in the last few weeks with pneumonia, said michael johnson, a former chief of staff to the congressman. michel, a decorated world war two veteran who was wounded in the battle of the bulge, was first elected in 1956 to the u.s. house of representatives from illinois and served for 38 years. his time in the house came during a four decade era of democratic control, but as minority leader starting in 1981 michel helped shepherd the policies of republican presidents ronald reagan and george h.w. bush through congress. in a statement, bush called michel “a great american for whom the words ‘duty’ and ‘honor’ and ‘country’ weren’t just a campaign slogan, but a lifelong creed.”  the courtly michel (pronounced “michael”), known as bob, amassed a conservative voting record but believed in bipartisanship and maintained friendships with many democratic colleagues, including house speakers tip o’neill and tom foley. “it has always puzzled me that in washington we have no public vocabulary to describe civility, which i believe is among the highest public virtues,” michel said in 1991.  “raising the level of your voice doesn’t raise the level of discussion. listening with care is better than talking in sound bites and thinking in slogans. ... peaks of uncommon progress can be reached by paths of common courtesy.” michel served as house republican leader for 14 years until deciding not to seek re election to the house in the november 1994 elections. with the rise of conservative rabble rousers like georgia’s newt gingrich in the house republican caucus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, michel’s brand of leadership   consultation with democrats instead of confrontation   was becoming obsolete. after gingrich signaled he might try to depose him as republican leader, michel expressed confidence that he would have won but said such a fight would have been “fratricidal.” gingrich and his allies sought to portray the democratic leaders of the house as corrupt legislative dictators. in may 1993, michel warned that the “politics of anger” was slowly destroying the united states’ civic environment. michel announced in october 1993 he would retire from the house after the 1994 election. michel lamented that congress was becoming a place lacking camaraderie and deplored colleagues who resorted to “trashing the institution” for political gain. gingrich helped engineer a republican takeover of the house in the 1994 elections and rose to the job of speaker. his  ascendancy and michel’s retirement ushered in a new combative style of leadership for house republicans, who have remained largely uncompromising ever since. michel served in the house under five republican and four democratic presidents. the last of them, democrat bill clinton, honored him with the presidential medal of freedom, the highest u.s. civilian award. “in the best sense he is a gentleman legislator who, in spite of the great swings in public opinion from year to year, has remained always true to the midwestern values he represents so faithfully in the house,” clinton said during the august 1994 ceremony. michel was born in 1923 in peoria, illinois, long viewed as a symbol of small town america, and grew up in the great depression. he served as an infantryman in europe during world war two and earned two bronze stars, the purple heart and four battle stars. after graduating from bradley university in peoria, michel worked in a congressional office until winning his house seat in 1956. he married his wife corinne in 1948 and the couple had four children. she died in 2003.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday brushed off billionaire investor warren buffett’s blistering critique of his business acumen. “i don’t care much about warren buffett,” trump said on the fox business television network tuesday morning, a day after buffett lashed out at trump in a speech at a campaign rally for democratic candidate hillary clinton. buffett, a widely followed investor who is chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway inc, scorned trump’s 1995 move to list trump hotels and casino resorts on the new york stock exchange, saying it lost money for the next decade and that “a monkey” would have outperformed trump’s company. he also challenged trump to release his tax returns, something the real estate mogul and television star has declined to do so far citing an internal revenue service audit. trump, who has held up his career in business as a qualification to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in atlantic city, new jersey. “i had great timing. i got out,” after seven years, he told fox business on tuesday. “i took a lot of money out of atlantic city, which is what i’m supposed to do. i’m a businessperson.”  trump said he “did well in the good times in atlantic city, but then times started going very bad.”  trump said he used to invest in u.s. stocks but got out because “i don’t like what i’m seeing at all,” pointing to u.s. immigration policies, syrian refugees and what he said were “artificially low” interest rates. he also vowed to spend twice as much on u.s. infrastructure as clinton, who has pledged $275 billion on rebuilding the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges, among other structures. trump, who has been criticized by fellow republicans and others for responding too readily to opponents, declined to target buffett personally for his comments: “there’s no counter punch.”  buffett on monday vowed to do “whatever it takes” to get out the vote in his congressional district in nebraska, including driving voters himself to the polls to cast ballots.  with clinton by his side, buffett told the crowd that his “final straw” was trump’s critical response to the muslim parents of a decorated u.s. soldier killed by a bomb in iraq 12 years ago.  buffett is no. 3 on forbes magazine’s list of the richest billionaires, with a net worth calculated at $60.8 billion.

" a bill to ease restrictions on energy development on u.s. tribal lands has a good chance of passing the republican controlled congress this year, after several failed attempts since 2013, the chair of the senate indian affairs committee said. many republican lawmakers, along with president donald trump, have expressed support for more oil drilling, coal mining and other energy projects on native american reservations, which are overseen by the federal government. several additional layers of regulatory bureaucracy have slowed those efforts. “i think we will be able to get the bill through the house this go around,” republican senator john hoeven of north dakota, who authored the bill with seven other republican senators, said in a recent interview with reuters.  he said he believed the bill also had the support of “a broad spectrum of tribes across the country” and would “empower” native americans. the bill, dubbed the tribal energy development and self determination act, would authorize tribes to conduct their own energy resource appraisals. it would streamline the permitting process for drilling and mining and provide incentives for tribes to enter into joint venture agreements with private companies. former president barack obama had opposed a previous house version of the bill in 2015 because it would have exempted tribes from some federal environmental regulations. other versions were blocked after being rolled into broader bills that were defeated. tribal lands cover just 2 percent of the nation’s surface but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all remaining u.s. oil and gas reserves. but clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps, compared to a half dozen on private property, according to reuters interviews conducted in january with tribal leaders, lawyers, oil company executives and federal regulators. hoeven and montana republican senator steve daines joined around a dozen representatives of mineral rich tribes for a meeting with white house officials last week to discuss ways to reduce those barriers. tribal participants at the meeting included representatives of the crow agency of montana, the three affiliated tribes of north dakota, the navajo nation and the southern ute indian tribe of colorado   all tribes that currently produce oil, gas or coal. “we are just trying to amplify our opportunities, change the narrative of indian country, and establish access to the administration,” said c.j. stewart, a representative of the crow.

" republican donald trump sought to regain momentum for his white house campaign on monday by proposing sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled keystone xl oil pipeline project. the new york businessman used a speech on the economy in detroit to try to turn the page after a week of missteps in which he came under heavy criticism, including from some in his own party, and rival democrat hillary clinton surged ahead in opinion polls three months ahead of the nov. 8 election. “i want to jump start america,” trump said, “and it won’t even be that hard.” trump stuck to prepared remarks rather than the freewheeling style that often produces controversial comments at rallies. he kept his cool as some 14 protesters jumped to their feet and shouted at coordinated intervals as he spoke at the detroit economic club.  trump’s remarks, which were repeatedly cheered by the crowd, appeared targeted at both an affluent business community and working people, in particular those who have suffered from a decline in u.s. manufacturing in cities such as detroit. he dismissed clinton as representing “the tired voices of the past.”  “we now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for america,” trump said. “it’s a conversation about how to make america great again for everyone ... especially for those who have the very least.” much of the speech reflected republican talking points and critics said his proposals lacked detail. but republican operatives and others who saw the speech praised trump for turning his focus to policy and contrasting his ideas with clinton’s. the question for trump now is whether he will be able to keep his campaign on message as republicans want him to do. trump pitched a tax plan that mirrored traditional republican thinking that lowering taxes and slashing regulation generates economic growth and jobs. he proposed lowering individual and corporate rates and a discounted 10 percent levy for businesses that bring back profits held overseas. trump’s plan to create new tax deductions for childcare costs raised questions from economists about whether lower income families would benefit. many republicans remain frustrated with his trade vision, which bucks party orthodoxy by calling for a rewrite of major agreements. “my response is good, bad and ugly,” said lanhee chen, who was policy director for the 2012 presidential campaign of republican mitt romney. “i think the trade position remains pretty ugly,” he said. “but i understand why they did it. i think it’s a strong effort, at least, to meld elements of conservative economic policy with trump’s more populist thinking.” trump’s effort to shift focus came after what was widely seen as the worst week of his campaign, in which he sparred with party leaders and got entangled in a dispute with the parents of a muslim u.s. soldier who was killed in the iraq war. republican senator susan collins added her name on monday to a growing list of republican lawmakers who say they will not vote for trump. some frustrated republicans plan to back a conservative alternative, former cia officer evan mcmullin. on monday, trump waited for the frequent disruptions by protesters to end, smiling and refraining from his practice at campaign rallies of asking security to “get them out of here.” a group called the michigan people’s campaign took credit for the protests, which they said were aimed at trump’s recent comments about sexual harassment. clinton will outline her economic vision in michigan on thursday. in a statement issued before trump’s speech, her campaign said his plan would give tax breaks to the wealthy and big companies and would hurt working families.  at a rally on monday in st. petersburg, florida, she derided a list of economic advisers trump released last week as “six guys named steve.” “now, they tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new,” clinton said. “he wants to basically just repackage trickle down economics.” trump’s rough week took its toll in opinion polls. a washington post abc news poll released on sunday gave clinton an eight point lead, 50 percent to 42 percent.  trump, a real estate developer who has never held elected public office, touts his practical experience and potential to create jobs, blaming president barack obama for what he calls a weak recovery from the economic recession. on monday, he said clinton would rely on policies that have not worked. “she is the candidate of the past,” trump said. “ours is the campaign of the future.” reaction from the crowd in detroit was mixed.  “i think he laid out a good bullet point on how he’s going to solve the economic problems with his trade policies,” said insurance executive sal giammursta. others wanted more details. “people were looking for more substance,” said lawyer al rogalski. trump called for a temporary moratorium on new regulations and repeated his pledges to rewrite the landmark north american trade deal that president bill clinton, hillary clinton’s husband, signed in 1994, and to withdraw from the 12 nation trans pacific partnership deal backed by obama. but much of the reaction was to trump’s tax plan. he again proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. and he proposed lowering income based individual tax brackets to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. in 2015, trump proposed a lower top rate of 25 percent. after criticism from budget experts who said such low rates would balloon deficits, he tweaked his proposal to be more in line with policies supported by republicans in congress. “it’s encouraging that donald trump appears to be modifying his tax plan,” said maya macguineas, president of the anti debt committee for a responsible federal budget. the research group tax policy center estimated in december that trump’s original plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $9.5 trillion in the first decade.  steve moore, an adviser to trump, said the campaign believes it has made changes to bring the plan’s cost down to $2 trillion to $3 trillion. a campaign aide said trump would give more detail in a later speech.

" omarosa manigault newman, a former reality television star turned political aide to u.s. president donald trump, has resigned from the white house to “pursue other opportunities,” trump’s spokeswoman sarah sanders said on wednesday. newman served as assistant to the president and director of communications for the white house’s office of public liaison.  a former star of trump’s tv show “the apprentice,” newman worked as the director of african american outreach on trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. sanders said newman’s departure would take effect jan. 20, 2018.  newman had what sometimes appeared to be an ambiguous role in the white house orbit. the new york times reported in september that chief of staff john kelly had put her on a “no fly list” of aides who he did not consider fit to attend serious meetings. sources with ties to the white house have said they expect a wave of departures from the administration once trump has completed his first year in office.

" the european union agreed on wednesday to extend for another six months its blacklist of 149 russian nationals and ukrainian separatists, as well as 38 entities, for their role in the turmoil in ukraine, sources in brussels said.  during a weekly meeting in brussels, representatives of the 28 eu states agreed on the roll over, which will formally be adopted on sept. 14, and prolong the visa ban and asset freeze list until mid march. the bloc first imposed sanctions on russia after it annexed the black sea peninsula of crimea from kiev in march 2014, and ratcheted them up as moscow went on to back a separatist revolt in the east of the former soviet republic.  russia vows to never return crimea though the annexation has not been internationally recognized and is denounced as illegal. the conflict in east ukraine has killed more than 10,000 people and is still simmering, a key factor souring russia s relations with the west, including the eu. the bloc s separate main economic sanctions against russia, which curb eu cooperation in the energy, defense and financial fields, are in place until the end of january 2018.  apart from separatist leaders in crimea and east ukraine, the eu s blacklist, which prevents people getting visas or freezes their assets, includes senior russian officials and companies that have supported or benefited from the crisis.

" hurricane irma swept over u.s. president donald trump s 11 bedroom caribbean mansion on wednesday, the first of several luxury trump properties threatened by the storm s path. it was not immediately known whether irma damaged trump s beachfront chateau des palmiers, or castle of the palms, on st. martin. the gated estate, for sale for $16.9 million, is owned through a trust and had been rented out, u.s. media has reported. but french interior minister gerard collomb said some buildings had been destroyed and social media showed flooded roads and overturned cars on the island that is roughly divided between france and the netherlands.  the situation was being closely monitored on st. martin and at a number of trump properties in florida, trump organization spokesperson amanda miller told reuters in a statement.  our teams at the trump properties in florida are taking all of the proper precautions and following local and florida state advisories very closely to ensure that everyone is kept safe and secure,  miller said. while irma s exact trajectory remained uncertain, trump s mar a lago estate in palm beach   which has been called the  winter white house  and valued by forbes at $175 million   could also take a hit. trump bought the estate in 1985 and turned it into an exclusive club, which now boasts a membership fee of $200,000 and is a haven for the tony palm beach set who pull up to the gate in bentleys and rolls royces. a staffer who answered the phone said it was closed and declined to comment further. palm beach county declared a state of emergency on wednesday. near miami, trump owns luxury high rise condos called the trump towers, sunny isles and the oceanfront trump international beach resort. some guests were leaving ahead of the storm but precautions were being taken and resort officials were prepared to oversee evacuations if they were ordered, marketing director jim monastra said. at the trump national doral, an 800 acre golf resort in miami that local media reported had completed a $250 million renovation last year, officials tweeted wednesday that resort operations were going on as normal until further notice.

" an islamic state evacuation convoy trying to reach is territory in east syria has split in two, with some buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government held areas, a u.s. led coalition fighting the group said on sunday.  the syrian government and lebanon s hezbollah group offered the convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and about 300 family members safe passage a week ago in return for islamic state surrendering an enclave on the syria lebanon border.  however, the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering islamic state territory in east syria, near the border with iraq, by cratering roads and destroying bridges, saying it opposes the evacuation deal as being  not a lasting solution .   one group remains in the open desert to the north west of al bukamal and the other group has headed west towards palmyra,  the coalition said in an emailed statement. on saturday hezbollah said all but six of the buses had safely crossed out of syrian government territory and were no longer the responsibility of it or the syrian government. it warned the united states that the buses in the desert included elderly people, pregnant women and casualties, and accused it of stopping humanitarian aid reaching the convoy. the coalition said it had contacted russia to deliver a message to the syrian government that it would still not let the convoy pass, and that it had offered suggestions on how to save the civilians in it from suffering.   food and water have been provided to the convoy,  it said, without giving further details.  the coalition has said it will not target the convoy directly while it contains civilians, but said in its statement it had struck about 85 is fighters near the convoy.  it had also struck about 40 is vehicles near the convoy including a tank, an artillery system, armed vehicles and transport vehicles seeking to help move the fighters in the convoy into its territory, it said.

" senate republican leader mitch mcconnell voiced doubt on tuesday that the u.s. debt ceiling would be eliminated permanently, an idea floated by democrats and embraced by republican president donald trump last week. “as far as the debt ceiling is concerned, we will not be revisiting the debt ceiling until some time next year,” mcconnell told reporters. “and getting congress to give up a tool like that would probably be quite a challenging undertaking.” congress must periodically raise the debt limit to keep the u.s. government borrowing and operating. lawmakers sometimes take advantage of that need to push through policy or spending changes.  trump voiced support last week for the idea of eliminating the statutory cap on the u.s. treasury department’s authority to borrow, saying he discussed the possibility with congressional leaders. “it complicates things. it’s really not necessary,” trump told reporters at the white house on thursday. at a white house meeting a day earlier, trump made a surprise deal with democratic congressional leaders for extending the debt limit for three months tied to hurricane relief legislation and funding for government operations into december. in the meeting, which was also attended by top congressional republicans and administration officials, senate democratic leader chuck schumer proposed eliminating the debt limit, and trump and vice president mike pence said they liked the idea, one person familiar with the meeting said. white house budget chief mick mulvaney told fox news channel that trump was frustrated by the way the debt ceiling has been used and had asked him to “explore ways to sort of depoliticize it.” “we’ll continue to work on that. i don’t think the debt ceiling ... will be an issue until january, february of next year,” mulvaney said. some republicans expressed opposition to trump’s deal with the democrats, and conservative groups accused the president of caving in rather than insisting on spending cuts to accompany the debt ceiling increase. but the house of representatives and the senate, which are both controlled by republicans, quickly approved the deal, including about $15 billion in hurricane related aid, and it was signed into law by trump on friday.

" eight u.s. senate democrats questioned on tuesday whether they could trust president donald trump’s nominee for the top job at the u.s. export import bank to support renewing the trade lender’s charter in 2019 and to believe in its mission. scott garrett, a former republican congressman from new jersey who was one of the exim bank’s leading opponents during a 2015 fight in congress to shut it down, “refused to confirm that he would unequivocally support reauthorizing the bank,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer and seven other senators said in a statement after meeting with garrett. the nominee for exim chairman has met with strong opposition from industry groups that use its financing, including the national association of manufacturers, which said garrett had a track record of trying to undermine the institution. the bank has been unable to approve loans above $10 million for two years because of efforts by conservative republicans in congress to shut it down and then block nominations to its board, keeping it from financing large aircraft, satellites, power turbines and other major projects. critics have charged that exim provides unnecessary “corporate welfare” to large companies such as boeing (ba.n), general electric (ge.n) and caterpillar (cat.n), putting taxpayers at risk. the bank also provides export financing and guarantees for thousands of small manufacturers. “today’s meeting was bizarre. scott garrett – one of the most vocal opponents of the export import bank while he was in congress – agreed to speak with us about his nomination, but during the meeting, he wouldn’t discuss his personal thoughts about the bank and its mission,” the senators said in a statement. “the bank has overwhelming support from republicans and democrats in congress and we need a leader of the bank who also fully stands by its goals,” added the senators, who included democrats heidi heitkamp, maria cantwell, patty murray, sherrod brown, amy klobuchar, chris coons and joe donnelly. their statement did not say specifically how they would vote on garrett’s nomination. no nomination hearing has been scheduled by the senate banking committee. a white house spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment on the senators’ statement.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will call for higher trade standards at a saturday campaign stop in youngstown, ohio, to ensure that automakers that use largely foreign parts are not given preference for producing “made in america” cars. her campaign said clinton will tell supporters she will take a stand against weak “rules of origin” and will say the pending trans pacific partnership, a trade compact with 12 nations, is not stringent enough. the tpp, which is being finalized by the obama administration, sets the content threshold for “made in america” cars at 45 percent. clinton has said she opposes the tpp because it does not do enough to protect u.s. workers. international trade deals have become a flash point in the u.s. presidential race.

" the philippines plans a cut of 75 percent in spending next year on drug rehabilitation facilities, while at the same time seeking a massive hike in funding for a war on drugs that has killed thousands, fuelling concerns among lawmakers.  the government has rejected criticism that it lacked the commitment to rehabilitate drug users, saying it has attracted financing and is building treatment facilities, but had underestimated the scale of addiction.   more than 3,800 people, most of them drugs suspects, have died in police operations in the drug war unleashed by president rodrigo duterte in july last year. police deny they were executing suspects, saying those killed had violently resisted arrest. senator ralph recto, who has questioned the government s anti drugs budget, said he would scrutinize its proposal to cut expenditure on drug rehabilitation centers by 2.3 billion pesos ($45.23 million), compared to this year. the government has asked congress for an increase of more than 40 times in next year s police budget for anti drugs operations next year.  i will discuss these issues when the budget is formally presented,  recto told reuters in a text message. the lack of rehabilitation centers would cripple the  declared government policy  to wean substance abusers off drugs, recto said in a statement over the weekend.     in august, health secretary paulyn ubial said eight drug rehabilitation centers would be built across the philippines, funded by private firms, including conglomerate san miguel corp and property firm megaworld. last year, manila opened what it called a  mega  drug rehabilitation facility to treat up to 10,000 patients and funded by a chinese tycoon.  the department of health submitted a budget of 759.6 million pesos for state managed rehabilitation facilities under the government s proposed 2018 spending plan, significantly less than this year s budget of 3.08 billion pesos. methamphetamine use for a year or more would shrink the brain of a person, duterte said in a speech in august last year, adding,  therefore he is no longer viable for rehabilitation.  he estimated there are already more than 3 million philippine drug users in a country of more than 100 million people.  the government s 13 drug abuse treatment and rehab facilities treated 14,733 out patients in 2016, up more than three times from the previous year, and close to 30,000 in  patients, up four percent over 2015, the health department says.   duterte has said the drugs war will continue and would be  unremitting as it will be unrelenting .

" germany s highest court ruled on wednesday in favor of the introduction of a third gender category for people who do not identify as either male or female or are born with an ambiguous sexual anatomy. the federal constitutional court called on lawmakers to enact legislation by the end of 2018 to either allow the introduction of a third category or dispense with gender altogether in civil status documents. in 2013, germany became the first european country to recognize indeterminate sex by allowing babies born with no clear gender determining anatomy to be put on the birth register without a male or female classification. wednesday s decision overturned a ruling by a lower court last year in a case brought by a german citizen born in 1989, identified as vanja by the third option campaign group that supported the plaintiff in the case. the lower court said it was not possible to be registered as third gender because vanja could leave the gender identity blank. however, the federal constitutional court said germany s basic law, or constitution, protected the personality rights of individuals who do not define themselves as male or female, adding that the current law on civil status interfered with that right.  the basic law does not require that civil status be exclusively binary in terms of gender,  the court said in a statement. the third option group described the ruling as  historic , but said it is only the  first step on improving the situation of inter and transgender people .  finally it s recognized by the federal constitutional court that there are more genders than man or woman,  said mortiz schmidt, the spokesman of the group. antke engel, the director of the institute of queer theory in berlin, said she was impressed that ruling gave lawmakers the possibility of dropping the gender category altogether.   of course that would be the more radical version,  engel said. jamie zulauf, a 30 year old medical student who identifies as transgender, welcomed the move but said it could mean new problems when traveling to countries where a third gender is not accepted.   it s going to be visible and it s not always safe to be visible,  jamie said. the government in berlin estimated in 2013 there were 8,000 to 10,000 intersex people in germany but interest groups say the number could be closer to 80,000.

"like dominoes, the hijra keeps marching across europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. sweden and the uk are in big trouble france is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal democrats in america, the u.s. isn t be far behind at least 85 islamic sharia courts are operating in britain, a study claimed yesterday.the astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.the tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. they lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.however, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank civitas said.commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in london, manchester, bradford, birmingham and nuneaton that are run by the muslim arbitration tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 arbitration act.but the study by academic and islamic specialist denis maceoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.the spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams and lord phillips, the lord chief justice who stepped down last october.dr williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and lord phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.but the civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by british mosques.mr maceoin said:  among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by british courts. examples set out in his study include a ruling that no muslim woman may marry a non-muslim man unless he converts to islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a muslim.further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.the report added:  the fact that so many sharia rulings in britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the uk. under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. it said:  sharia courts operating in britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in western legislation. watch muslims demand shari law in britain:the civitas study said the islamic courts should no longer be recognised under british law.its director dr david green said:  the reality is that for many muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. philip davies, tory mp for shipley, said:  everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. they do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. it leads to a segregated society. there should be one law, and that should be british law. we can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. we can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. everyone should equal under one law. for entire story: daily mail ",1

" a draft of president donald trump’s new counterterrorism strategy demands that u.s. allies shoulder more of the burden in combating islamist militants, while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated. the 11 page draft, seen on friday by reuters, said the united states should avoid costly, “open ended” military commitments. “we need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of american ‘blood and treasure’ in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals,” states the document, which is expected to be released in coming months. “we will seek to avoid costly, large scale u.s. military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups,” it says. however, it acknowledges that terrorism “cannot be defeated with any sort of finality.” michael anton, spokesman for the white house national security council, said, “as part of its overall approach, the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire u.s.  national security strategy, to include the counterterrorism mission   which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011.” the process is aimed at ensuring “the new strategy is directed against the pre eminent terrorist threats to our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and allies,” anton said. “moreover, this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals, and guiding principles.” combating islamic extremism was a major issue for trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. the draft strategy paper,  which officials said was still being fine tuned at the white house, describes the threat from islamic militant groups in stark tones.      it remains to be seen how trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving u.s. troops in iraq, syria, afghanistan, yemen and elsewhere. rather than scale back u.s. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like yemen and somalia. trump may soon reverse years of obama ordered drawdowns in afghanistan. his administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400 strong u.s. contingent helping afghan forces fight a resurgent taliban, current and former u.s. officials say. a senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to u.s. forces in iraq and syria under trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.  “if you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. the increased pace of u.s. military operations has seen a recent spate of american casualties. the latest came in somalia, where a navy seal died and two others were wounded in an attack by al shabaab militants, u.s. officials said on friday. since president barack obama released the last u.s. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of islamic state, the threat has “diversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago,” the draft strategy said. in addition to islamic state, the united states and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al qaeda, groups such as the haqqani network and hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said. bruce hoffman, director of georgetown university’s center for security studies and who reviewed the document at reuters’ request, said the draft strategy “paints   and i think accurately   a more dire picture” of the threat than the obama document, which sounded a “triumphalist” tone following al qaeda leader osama bin laden’s death in a 2011 u.s. raid in pakistan. the senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat islamic state that trump also has ordered.  the draft strategy seen by reuters appears to flow from trump’s “america first” foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden sharing by allies and alliances such as nato. it does not include a signature phrase from trump’s 2016 campaign, “radical islamic terrorism.” instead, it says that jihadist groups “have merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale.” the draft’s first guiding principle is that the united states “will always act to disrupt, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and our allies. this includes taking direct and unilateral action, if necessary.” the administration would boost u.s. homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders, “ideologues, technical experts, financiers, external operators and battlefield commanders.” the draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and “degrade their efforts to develop and deploy” chemical and biological weapons. yet it provides few details on how the united states, which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the sept. 11, 2001, attacks, can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries, many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities. the draft makes little mention of promoting human rights, development, good governance and other “soft power” tools that washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism. in contrast, the obama counterterrorism strategy made “respecting human rights, fostering good governance, respecting privacy and civil liberties, committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law” the foremost of its guiding principles. “soft power has a role to play, but not to the exclusion of kinetics,” or military action, said hoffman. he called the draft “a very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it.” ",0
" the european union’s foreign policy chief, federica mogherini, said on friday she was reassured during meetings with president donald trump’s administration that it was committed to full implementation of the iran nuclear deal. in her first visit to washington since trump took power, mogherini came to present the european union as a valuable friend to the united states with common priorities. in a nod to trump’s preferred style of diplomacy, she said that the european union could adopt a more formal “transactional approach” on some issues to appeal to the new administration. mogherini, who met this week with secretary of state rex tillerson, national security advisor michael flynn, trump’s advisor and son in law jared kushner and members of congress, said her main intention in washington was to discuss the nuclear accord, which granted iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program. her visit suggests concern among european and other countries, including russia and china, that the trump administration may withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal. there have been increasing concerns since the white house put iran “on notice” for test firing a ballistic missile. days later, washington tightened sanctions against iran by imposing measures against 25 individuals and entities for the missile test.  “i was reassured by what i heard in the meetings on the intention to stick to the full implementation of the agreement,” mogherini told reporters. mogherini said she won assurances from members of the trump administration that they believe russia should abide by the terms of the 2015 minsk agreement to end fighting in eastern ukraine. mogherini said she and tillerson discussed how the minsk agreement might be fully implemented. but mogherini also signaled doubt about trump’s commitment to u.s. policy towards russia. republicans and democrats in congress have expressed concern that trump will be too conciliatory towards moscow, perhaps by granting russia relief from sanctions on its energy, defense and finance industries. “we agreed that as long as the minsk agreements are not fully implemented, sanctions would remain in place,” mogherini said later on friday at a washington think tank. “but i don’t know if this is going to be the consolidated policy ... i was not in the oval office when president trump called president (vladimir) putin.” mogherini avoided directly criticizing trump, but said european history showed that blocking the movement of people is doomed to fail.  trump has vowed to build a wall along the u.s. southern border to block illegal immigration from mexico. he has also issued an executive order barring people from iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen from entering the united states for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from syria, who are banned indefinitely.   “we tend to celebrate when walls come down,” mogherini said. “america has always been great because it has been made up of many people coming from different places.” ",0
" indian police have arrested two hindu farmers in connection with the killing of a muslim man suspected of smuggling cows to a slaughter house, the investigating officer said on wednesday. hardline hindu groups have gained prominence since prime minister narendra modi s nationalist bharatiya janata party came to power in 2014, and the protection of cows, considered holy by many in the hindu majority country, is a priority for them. police found the body of ummar khan, 35 on friday on railway tracks in alwar district, in the northwestern state of rajasthan. the two suspects were detained on monday and arrested the next day, said rahul prakash, the top police officer in alwar.  it is a clear case of murder over the issue of cow protection and we have also found that the victim was running a cow smuggling racket,  prakash said. khan and two accomplices were using a stolen vehicle to transport five cows when they were attacked by six members of a self styled cow protection force, he said.  both sides were carrying guns and were shooting at each other.  khan was shot dead and his body was thrown onto the railway track, prakash said. cow slaughter is illegal in most of india.  gau rakshaks , or cow vigilantes, run a loosely organized movement that they say is meant to prevent cattle smuggling, with tactics that include highway ambushes. modi has called for more to be done to prevent such attacks on people accused of eating beef or slaughtering cows. this year, a muslim farmer died from injuries sustained during an assault by a mob in alwar, about 180 km (100 miles) southwest of new delhi, when he was taking cows to his home. khan s wife, khurdisan, denied that her husband and been leading any cows to slaughter. she accused members of a right wing hindu group affiliated to modi s party of the murder.  he was bringing the cows home for their milk, not for their meat. i want the government to protect me and my children,  she was quoted as saying by hindi language rajasthan patrika newspaper.

" a native american tribe in montana and a coalition of conservation groups sued the trump administration on wednesday for lifting a moratorium on coal leases on public land without consulting tribal leaders and conducting a full environmental review. “it is alarming and unacceptable for the united states, which has a solemn obligation as the northern cheyenne’s trustee, to sign up for many decades of harmful coal mining near and around our homeland without first consulting with our nation,” tribal council chairman and president jace killsback said in a statement. the northern cheyenne tribe in southern montana said the administration had lifted the moratorium without hearing the tribe’s concerns about the coal leasing program’s impact on its members and lands. the tribe sent a letter earlier this month to interior secretary ryan zinke requesting a meeting to discuss the issue. zinke did not respond, and signed the order lifting the moratorium on tuesday. in a press call on wednesday, zinke did not respond to a query about the northern cheyenne lawsuit. killsback said the tribe, which filed the lawsuit in u.s. district court in great falls, would be harmed by lifting the ban. “the northern cheyenne rarely shares in the economic benefits to the region generated by coal industry and other energy development projects,” he said.  about 426 million tons of federal coal are located near the northern cheyenne reservation at the decker and spring creek mines in montana, the tribe said. however, neighboring tribe, the crow, relies on coal production as its predominant industry and has called for the relaxation of coal regulations for years. “a war on coal is a war on the crow people,” zinke said on the call. legal group earthjustice argued that lifting the coal moratorium imperils public health for the benefit of coal companies. “no one voted to pollute our public lands, air or drinking water in the last election, yet the trump administration is doing the bidding of powerful polluters as nearly its first order of business,” earthjustice attorney jenny harbine said in a statement. the legal filing said that undoing the moratorium violates the national environmental policy act, which requires a full environmental review prior to major policy changes.

" the united states believes progress with china on a range of trade issues has become more difficult and beijing appears on a  trajectory of retrenchment,  a senior trump administration official said on tuesday. president donald trump will insist in upcoming talks with chinese president xi jinping that more balance is needed in u.s. chinese trade relations, the official said, briefing reporters ahead of trump s nov. 3 14 asia trip that will include a stop in beijing. trump s asia tour is shaping up to be the longest by an american president in 25 years. with tensions aboil over north korea s nuclear challenge, trump leaves on friday on a trip with stops in japan, south korea, china, vietnam and the philippines. while in south korea, trump will speak to u.s. and south korea troops, but time constraints will preclude a stop at the demilitarized zone, the border region that separates north and south korea, another senior official said. the official s remarks on the u.s. chinese trade relations could herald some friction in trump s talks with xi on a state visit to beijing that comes just as xi consolidated power in a communist party congress. trump has repeatedly complained about the u.s. trade deficit with china, which was $347 billion in 2016. but he has shied away from taking major punitive trade actions against china. the official said over the long term china must provide fair and reciprocal treatment to u.s. and international companies and stop  predatory trade and investment practice.   progress on a range of bilateral economic issues has become increasingly difficult. we believe this reflects a slowdown and even a retrenchment in china s move toward a market oriented economy,  the official said. on monday, chinese ambassador to the united states cui tiankai predicted in a briefing with reporters that  there will be significant outcomes on the economic side  while trump is in beijing. cui said countries cannot look simply at trade balance and imbalance because what is behind those numbers is important and  very complicated.  he called the u.s. trade deficit a  structural problem  that cannot be resolved overnight. while on his trip trump will also hold his first face to face meeting with philippines president rodrigo duterte on the sidelines of the association of south east asia nations summit being held in manila. despite a history of anti american rhetoric, one of the administration officials said trump and duterte have developed a  warm rapport.

" republicans cheered after the u.s. supreme court on thursday thwarted president barack obama’s plan to offer millions of undocumented immigrants relief from deportation, but any sense of triumph might last only until the november presidential election.  if recent history is a guide, the stalled cause of immigration reform could energize hispanic voters in support of likely democratic nominee hillary clinton, hurting republican donald trump’s chances of reaching the white house.  four years ago, obama, seeking reelection to a second term, made republican opposition to reform a central theme of his campaign. he ended up swamping his opponent, mitt romney, by almost a 3 to 1 margin among latino voters, who now make up around 12 percent of the u.s. electorate. republican hopes for securing a larger share of that vote this election already seemed grim given trump’s vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and to build a wall along the southern u.s. border.  democrats were quick to assail the ruling and voice concern about the fate of the 4 million or so immigrants who were to be shielded from deportation by obama’s executive action. but it was also clear that they believe the high court has handed them a potent weapon to spur latinos — the fastest growing segment of the u.s. electorate — to vote in greater numbers. the latino voting bloc is expected to swell to 27.3 million in 2016, up 4 million from 4 years ago.  the prospect of clinton filling the current vacancy on the top court with a liberal leading justice who could, potentially, protect immigration reform programs, may galvanize those voters as well. republicans in congress have refused to accept obama’s pick for the top court to fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative justice antonin scalia in february.  the justices’ ruling on thursday sent the question of the legality of obama’s program back to a texas federal court for trial, leaving open the possibility that the matter could return to the high court on appeal at a later date.  the court’s decision “just adds fuel to the fire that’s already raging,” said brad bannon, a democratic strategist. “each of these events raises the intensity and the latino turnout even more.” in the wake of the ruling, immigration activists vowed payback in november’s election and staged protests on thursday. a recent survey by latino decisions, a polling firm, showed that about half of the u.s. hispanic electorate showed greater enthusiasm to vote in 2016 as compared to 2012, with support for obama’s pro immigrant executive orders running high.  “we should expect similar dynamics this fall, perhaps even more so given the election is likely to determine the ideological direction of the supreme court,” said david damore, an analyst for the firm. given trump’s unpopularity with latino voters, the question for many democrats both in and outside the clinton campaign has been less about attracting the bloc’s support and more about making sure it votes in large enough numbers to help offset trump’s expected advantage among white voters.  the court’s decision may also help make traditionally republican states with increasing hispanic populations such as arizona more competitive this election, strategists in both parties said.  reed galen, a republican strategist in california, said the ruling could boost democratic hopes in latino heavy battleground states such as nevada, colorado, and florida.  “the issue isn’t getting [latino voters] fired up,” galen said. “it’s getting them to show up.” galen believes there is little his party can do now to mitigate the damage he believes trump has done to its appeal among hispanics. a republican national committee “autopsy” report after romney’s defeat said it was essential for the party to broaden its appeal to hispanic voters by embracing immigration reform.  “trump has pushed the envelope on immigration so far for republicans, i don’t know this [decision] is going to be any more damaging,” he said. “the barn’s already been blown up.” but rev. samuel rodriguez, the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference, a conservative advocacy group, disagreed. he said republicans in congress could still enact reform this year, which would ward off trump’s deportation threat while building stronger ties with latino voters.  “this is the quintessential green light for republicans to put their money where their mouth is,” rodriguez said.  many republicans were careful on thursday to applaud the court’s ruling on the grounds that it curtailed what they viewed as an abuse of executive authority by obama, without delving into the underlying immigration issues.  “the constitution is clear: the president is not permitted to write laws — only congress is,” said paul ryan, the speaker of the u.s. house of representatives.  ryan supports comprehensive immigration reform. trump, however, went further, praising the ruling and saying the election now held the key to blocking further illegal immigration.  “the election, and the supreme court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country,” he said in a statement. he has vowed to reverse obama’s executive actions on immigration as president.

" the trump administration is preparing to relax obama era rules on drone strikes and commando raids, paving the way for more frequent operations against islamic state and other militant groups, the new york times reported on thursday, citing officials familiar with the internal deliberations. president donald trump’s advisers have proposed relaxing a rule that generally limits drone strikes and raids to high level militants deemed to pose a “continuing and imminent threat” to americans, the times said. the rule would be expanded to include foot soldiers, it said. the advisers also want to eliminate a rule that drone strikes and raids by the military and the central intelligence agency undergo high level vetting, according to the times. officials have agreed they should keep in place a requirement of “near certainty” that no civilian bystanders will be killed, the newspaper said. a cabinet level committee approved the proposed rules on sept. 14 and sent them to trump for his expected signature, the times said. the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment from reuters. former president barack obama established the rules in 2013 on operations by the military or the cia outside of war zones like afghanistan, iraq and syria.

" libyan authorities are processing a request from britain to extradite the brother of the bomber who killed 22 people in manchester in may, but no decision has been taken yet, a government spokesman said on thursday. the armed group holding the brother said that if the attorney general s office agreed to the request, the force would be  ready for the next step . salman abedi, a 22 year old briton born to libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by u.s. singer ariana grande in the deadliest militant attack in britain for 12 years. his victims included seven children. more than 500 people were injured. on wednesday, british police said they had issued an arrest warrant for his brother, hashem abedi, for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion, and prosecutors had asked libya to extradite him.  an official request has been received through the libyan ministry of foreign affairs and the libyan authorities are cooperating to process (the request) in accordance with libyan legal procedures,  said hassan al houni, a spokesman for the internationally recognized government in tripoli.   no decision has been taken yet.  days after the attack, the special deterrence force (rada), a counter terrorism and anti crime group aligned with the government, arrested hashem abedi and the brothers  father ramadan. the father was released in august. various armed factions in tripoli have aligned themselves with the government, some with semi official status for law enforcement. however, the government, which struggles to impose its authority, has limited power over them. rada initially said it would not extradite hashem, but then said it was ready to cooperate.  if there is agreement between the attorney general and the british authorities, we are ready for the next step,  spokesman ahmad ben salim said. the libyan attorney general s office could not be reached for comment. islamic state said it was responsible in the immediate aftermath of the bombing but security services have always treated the claim with scepticism. in june, rada said hashem abedi had told them his brother had been radicalised in britain in 2015. they had both flown from britain to libya in april and hashem said he had helped buy the equipment necessary for the attack although he had not known that salman was planning a bombing, rada said. british police say salman abedi returned to manchester on may 18, four days before his attack. the family had emigrated to britain during the rule of the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi. the brothers  parents returned to libya during the 2011 revolution. police have previously said they believed salman abedi had built the bomb himself and cctv showed him buying nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives.

" u.s. president donald trump’s move to revise a travel ban on citizens of certain muslim majority countries will not lessen its impact on tourism, the head of the un world tourism organization said. “people don’t go to places where they don’t feel welcome,” taleb rifai, the secretary general of the tourism organization, told reuters, before the world’s biggest travel trade fair, itb berlin, opens on wednesday. trump on monday signed a revised executive order banning citizens from six muslim majority nations from traveling to the united states but removing iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts. “it’s not about the details of which countries are included, it’s about the attitude,” rifai said on tuesday. last week, he told reuters that the united states had lost $185 million in one month after the first ban was introduced and stood to lose tens of millions more each month if similar policies continued. data from travel analysis company forwardkeys this week showed that demand for travel to the united states over the coming months had already flattened out following a positive start to the year. but any downturn in demand for travel to the united states is not expected to have an impact on travel in general. international tourist numbers are expected to grow 3 to 4 percent this year from last year’s 1.24 billion, rifai said on tuesday. “the world has opened up in incredible ways. there are so many options now. if you want to gamble, you don’t have to go to las vegas, you can go to macau instead,” he said. market researcher euromonitor has cut its forecast for u.s. arrivals by 2020 to 84.2 million from 85.2 million amid uncertainty over the travel ban. caroline bremner, head of travel research at euromonitor, said the seven countries included in the original travel ban represented only 0.1 percent of total inbound travelers there. “and so the impact on volume is not going to be as much as the message that the u.s. is sending to business and leisure travelers around the world, about the level of international openness and type of welcome they will receive under the new government,” she said.

" a senior blackrock inc executive made a donation to an unsuccessful u.s. presidential candidate last year, an action that may prohibit the world’s largest asset manager from collecting some fees from a state government, a company regulatory filing showed. mark wiedman, a blackrock senior managing director, donated $2,700 to the presidential campaign of ohio governor john kasich, who was seeking the republican party nomination, according to a filing made earlier this year with the u.s. securities and exchange commission and reviewed by reuters on monday. federal securities rules prohibit companies or their executive officers from making donations to government officials who could influence the hiring of a fund manager or have authority to appoint a person who could do so and then providing asset management services to their governments for a fee. the ban is in effect for two years after the contribution is made.  the state of ohio uses blackrock managed funds, and its relationship with blackrock “substantially predates” the donation, the filing said. in the may filing, blackrock asked the sec for permission to accept fees from the state of ohio, saying that exceptions to the rule have been granted before. without such a ruling, blackrock said it could face a loss of approximately $37 million. blackrock said wiedman asked for and received a refund of his campaign contribution to kasich, which was “made because of the personal political beliefs of the contributor and not because of any desire to influence the award of investment advisory business.” the sec has not yet responded to blackrock’s request. in an emailed statement, blackrock said its application is “fair and reasonable, and consistent with the intent of the relevant rule.” “the contribution in question was made solely in support of mr. kasich’s presidential campaign and for no other purpose,” blackrock spokeswoman tara mcdonnell said in the statement. “through blackrock’s robust policies and procedures, we discovered the contribution in question, and both blackrock and mr. wiedman worked together to promptly address the error, including obtaining a refund of the $2,700 contribution,” mcdonnell said. a spokesman for the sec, ryan white, declined to comment on the filing. a spokesman for kasich did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the donation. wiedman is global head of ishares and index investments, a booming business within blackrock that includes its exchange traded funds. the ishares brand brought in nearly $74 billion of new cash into blackrock in the second quarter. blackrock manages $5.7 trillion overall.

" u.s. president donald trump said he has prepared an “economic development” measure that would punish companies that globally outsource jobs. the bill would provide economic incentives for companies, trump said in an interview published on tuesday, and reward firms that maintain jobs in the united states, and deliver punitive measures against those that move operations offshore. “it’s both a carrot and a stick,” trump said. “it is an incentive to stay. but it is perhaps even more so   if you leave, it’s going to be very tough for you to think that you’re going to be able to sell your product back into our country.” he did not specify what the rewards or punishments would be. the white house was not immediately available to comment. trump, a new york real estate developer reality television host, has struggled to translate his business experience into government success, failing to push through any major legislative victories.  the trump administration has repealed a number of regulations. the head of the u.s. environmental protection agency said on monday he planned to rescind the clean power plan, which was former president barack obama’s cornerstone regulation to fight climate change.

" in an abrupt shift, u.s. senator ted cruz endorsed republican presidential nominee donald trump on friday, saying he is the only candidate who can stop democrat hillary clinton from winning the white house on nov. 8. “a year ago, i pledged to endorse the republican nominee, and i am honoring that commitment. and if you don’t want to see a hillary clinton presidency, i encourage you to vote for him,” the former republican presidential candidate said in a lengthy statement. cruz, a senator from texas who is a favorite of the conservative tea party movement, was one of trump’s last challengers for the republican presidential nomination to drop out of the race. when cruz addressed the republican national convention in july in cleveland, where trump accepted the nomination, he declined to endorse trump and was essentially booed off stage by the new york businessman’s supporters. during the heated primary battle, trump had insulted cruz’s wife, heidi, for her physical appearance. his wild suggestion that the senator’s father was linked to president john f. kennedy’s assassin prompted cruz to denounce trump as a “pathological liar.” in july, trump said, “i don’t want his endorsement.” on friday he said he was greatly honored to have cruz backing him. “we have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. i look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make america great again,” trump said. cruz cited the possibility of democrats taking control of the u.s. supreme court as a major reason why he decided to drop his opposition to trump. trump earlier in the day released the names of 21 prominent conservatives and said he would pick from this list in nominating a replacement for conservative justice antonin scalia, who died in february. the senate has refused to take any action on president barack obama’s nomination of merrick garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington, to fill the vacancy. one of the names on trump’s list was that of u.s. senator mike lee of utah, a key ally of cruz. cruz said that for some time he had been seeking greater specificity on trump’s views toward filling the opening on the court, which is currently deadlocked between four right leaning and four left leaning jurists. he said trump’s list “provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support trump” and that lee “would make an extraordinary justice.” cruz noted his qualms about trump, saying, “i have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election.” but in the end, he decided, trump “is the only thing standing in the way” of a clinton presidency that he said would be devastating to the united states.

" mayors from the largest u.s. cities warned president elect donald trump on wednesday of the potential economic harm he might cause if he wipes out a program that allows young illegal immigrants to remain in the united states. they warned in a letter that as much as $9.9 billion in tax revenue would be lost over four years and $433.4 billion in u.s. gross domestic product would be wiped out over 10 years if he cancels a policy aimed at protecting these people from deportation. daca, or the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy, was created through an executive order in 2012. it allows undocumented young people brought to the united states before the age of 16 to remain without fear of deportation as they pursue a higher education, work or engage in  military service. the deferred action is subject to renewal every two years. the mayors asked for the program to allow for initial applications and renewals to continue until “congress modernizes our immigration system and provides a more permanent form of relief for these individuals.” as president, trump would have the authority to undo daca. “this program helps foster economic growth and enhances public safety and national security,” said the letter, written by the democratic mayor of chicago, rahm emanuel, and signed by mayors of other major u.s. cities including new york, los angeles, and houston. “we are clear as mayors that these are dreamers who are seeking the american dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait and switch,” emanuel said after presenting trump the letter at a meeting in new york. trump has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, an estimated 11 million people, and promised to build a wall on the border with mexico. according to the letter, which was made available to the press, nearly 742,000 undocumented youths have participated in daca. daca is part of the broader immigration issue of municipalities that offer themselves up as “sanctuary cities,” where local law enforcement refuse to report to federal authorities undocumented immigrants they encounter. trump has threatened to cut off federal funding for those municipalities. while he would have the authority to cut some kinds of funding, mayors of those cities have said they will not be pressured to report migrants to federal agents. santa ana city council voted on tuesday to declare their community in southern california of 325,000 people, half of whom are foreign born and 80 percent of hispanic descent, a sanctuary city. in los angeles, the county board of supervisors on tuesday voted to ask county departments to provide plans for shielding undocumented immigrants from u.s. immigration authorities, said jessie gomez, a spokeswoman for supervisor hilda solis.  the board oversees health, law enforcement and social welfare departments that operate county wide but it does not administer the city of los angeles. nearly one million residents of los angeles county are believed to be undocumented immigrants, according to solis’ office. white house spokesman josh earnest on wednesday said he could not address the incoming president’s potential actions but that the current administration was working to ensure trump’s team understood why obama pursued the policy.      “the president’s been crystal clear, both in words and deeds, about his view that young people who are american in every way but their papers shouldn’t be deported ... a policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values,” earnest said of daca.

" u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday the united states would try  one more time  to work with pakistan in afghanistan before president donald trump would turn to options to address islamabad s alleged support for militant groups. relations between the two countries have been frayed over the past decade. while officials have long questioned the role pakistan has played in afghanistan, the comments by mattis are likely to cause concern in islamabad and within the pakistan military.  we need to try one more time to make this strategy work with them, by, with and through the pakistanis, and if our best efforts fail, the president is prepared to take whatever steps are necessary,  mattis said at a house armed services committee hearing. mattis added that he would be traveling to islamabad soon, but did not give more details. reuters first reported that possible trump administration responses being discussed include expanding u.s. drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading pakistan s status as a major non nato ally. when asked by a lawmaker whether revoking pakistan s major non nato ally status was amongst the options being considered to deal with islamabad, mattis said:  i am sure it will be.  in a separate senate hearing on tuesday, the top u.s. military officer said he believed pakistan s main spy agency, the inter services intelligence (isi) directorate, had ties to militant groups.  it is clear to me that the isi has connections with terrorist groups,  marine corps general joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told the senate armed services committee. the pakistan embassy in washington said islamabad had achieved success in counter terrorism operations in its country.  however, unless the same level of success is achieved in (afghanistan), long lasting peace in the region will remain out of reach,  the embassy said in a statement. the united states in 2012 designated the pakistan based haqqani network as a terrorist organization. the year before, u.s. navy admiral mike mullen, then the top u.s. military officer, caused a stir when he told congress that the haqqani network was a  veritable arm  of the isi directorate. u.s. officials have told reuters that the united states will send about 3,500 additional troops to afghanistan. dunford said that the current cost for the united states in afghanistan was about $12.5 billion a year, and the new strategy would cost an additional $1.1 billion.

" supreme court nominee judge neil gorsuch is known for questioning how far courts should go in deferring to federal agencies on interpreting the law, a view that could be important for u.s. companies and, perhaps, for president donald trump. nominated by trump on tuesday to fill a vacancy on the nation’s highest court, the 49 year old gorsuch is widely viewed as a sharp eyed jurist and a crisp writer who has the potential to be a persuasive voice on the court. in a recent case, gorsuch took a dim view of a landmark 1984 high court ruling, chevron v. natural resources defense council. widely cited, the ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to agencies’ interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous. it is known as “chevron deference.”  last august, in a case over immigration rules, gorsuch called the doctrine the “elephant in the room” that concentrates federal power “in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution.” showing his willingness to tackle the issue head on, he added, “maybe the time has come to face the behemoth.” if gorsuch can persuade other supreme court justices to question chevron deference, companies arguing before the high court against federal regulations might have a better chance on issues ranging from the environment to immigration. at the same time, broader skepticism of deference to agencies could have long term consequences for trump. the new president is moving swiftly to reshape the federal bureaucracy, appointing agency heads who could upend the legacy of president barack obama on emissions, health care and internet policy. the court’s views on agencies’ agendas will be critical. “the idea that president trump of all people would be the one to choose a justice who might push the court to reduce the executive power is pretty ironic,” said john nagle, a professor at the university of notre dame law school. if the supreme court were to overturn or limit the chevron precedent, lower courts could become more active in deciding the ultimate meaning of a statute, making it less likely that an agency’s view would stand, nagle said.  “it could make it more difficult for the trump administration to defend some of its regulatory actions in federal court,” said case western reserve university school of law professor jonathan adler.  republicans in congress, particularly when obama was in office, frequently complained about chevron deference. they have even debated legislation that would override it. the house of representatives passed such a bill on jan. 11, although it is unlikely to win approval in the senate. gorsuch is not the first judge to take aim at the issue. in 2015, the supreme court ruled against the environmental protection agency over its regulations for limiting pollution from mercury and other toxic materials. at that time, conservative justice clarence thomas wrote a separate opinion saying the government’s position “raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes.” while thomas has argued the doctrine threatens the constitutionally mandated separation of the different branches of government, chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy have said it may threaten individual liberties, said andrew grossman, a conservative lawyer who has represented companies challenging government regulations. “gorsuch may be the one to bring the court together on fundamental questions of administrative power that have sparked so much controversy and divisiveness in recent years,” grossman said. some court watchers say that in practice the justices are inclined to support executive actions that are in keeping with their own views. but an analysis of their votes carried out by jack beermann, a professor at boston university school of law, showed that such an outcome is not uniform.

" representatives of afghanistan, china, pakistan and the united states will meet in oman next week to discuss reviving peace talks with afghan taliban militants, an afghan official and a pakistani foreign ministry source said on wednesday. but it was not clear if afghan taliban representatives would join the talks. taliban sources said they had not yet received an invitation and plan to skip monday s discussions in muscat, casting doubt on efforts to revive long stalled negotiations. the four nation quadrilateral coordination group (qgc), comprising afghanistan, china, pakistan and the united states, has been trying to ease the path to direct talks between the afghan government and the taliban, with little success. the taliban, ousted in a u.s. led military intervention in 2001, has been gaining territory in recent years through a violent insurgency to try to topple afghanistan s western backed government and re establish a fundamentalist islamic regime. amin waqad, a close aide to agfhan president ashraf ghani and a senior member of the high peace council (hpc), said,  hpc and government representatives will participate, and it is an important one because the taliban representatives will be there.  we will go with a clear plan.  a senior pakistani foreign ministry official confirmed the talks would take place on oct 16. last week, foreign minister khawaja asif told voice of america the  quadrilateral arrangement will again be in operation  in muscat in october. the u.s. embassy in islamabad did not comment for the  report. talks and efforts to kick start negotiations have failed following the 2015 announcement of the death of the taliban s founder and long time leader, mullah mohammed omar, in 2013. the united states wants pakistan, which it accuses of harboring afghan taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring them to the negotiating table. pakistani officials deny sheltering taliban militants and say their influence on the group has waned. two senior afghan taliban leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reuters the group s leadership council met on tuesday and decided it would not send a delegation to muscat even if the group was invited to participate.  till that time, we were not invited, but even if we received any invitation, our senior members decided not to participate in the meeting,  said one of the taliban leaders.

" victim advocates and former prosecutors used the anniversary of the 1995 oklahoma city bombing on tuesday to lobby the u.s. senate on behalf of u.s. supreme court nominee merrick garland, who oversaw the prosecution of bomber timothy mcveigh. the group, which also includes law enforcement officials, said in a letter to senate leaders that garland, a federal appeals court judge picked by president barack obama for the supreme court, is a man of “integrity and brilliance” who proved his mettle in obtaining the conviction of mcveigh. “twenty years ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer to manage the investigation and prosecution of what was then the worst crime ever committed on american soil. today, our nation could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable man, to join its highest court,” the group of 15 connected to garland through the case said in the letter. it was the latest effort by garland supporters to put pressure on the republican led senate to act on his nomination to fill a vacancy created by the feb. 13 death of conservative justice antonin scalia. republicans who control the senate are refusing to advance the nomination, prompting democrats to accuse them of obstructionism and of ignoring their constitutional obligations. republicans insist the next president, to be elected on nov. 8 and take office jan. 20, fill the vacancy, hoping a republican will win the white house and choose a conservative rather than the centrist garland. mcveigh used a fuel and fertilizer bomb to turn oklahoma city’s alfred p. murrah federal building into a tomb of rubble on april 19, 1995, killing 168 people.  more than 680 people were injured in the attack. mcveigh was later executed.  in the letter that included former deputy attorney general jamie gorelick, garland’s boss at the time of the mcveigh trial, the group credited him with running an intricate and complex operation to secure a conviction that would stand up to any sort of appeal. “the pressure to get it right was unyielding – and judge garland’s support was critical. he was not just a supervisor; he was a mentor, a counselor, and a friend,” the letter said. in oklahoma city on tuesday, the remembrance ceremony was held in a church near the blast site and marked with prayers and 168 seconds of silence for the victims.

" u.s. president donald trump on saturday defended a republican tax cut plan against democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be “one of the great christmas gifts” for the middle class with just days to go before congress votes. with a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for tuesday, republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched democratic opposition. the plan was finalized on friday after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged their support. three republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trump’s party controls with a slim 52 48 majority, remained uncommitted: susan collins, jeff flake and mike lee. passage in congress would provide republicans and trump with their first major victory since he took office in january. “it’s going to be one of the great christmas gifts to middle income people,” trump told reporters at the white house before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at camp david. “the democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,” he added. the proposed package would slash the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans. under an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. for months, trump has touted the bill as a middle class tax cut. studies from independent analysts and non partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. trump repeated on saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from u.s. companies. the tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas. “this is going to bring money in. as an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,” he said. “that’s money that’s overseas that’s stuck there for years and years.” ",0
" president donald trump’s decision to pull out of the paris climate deal followed an internal debate that pitted anti globalist advisers like steve bannon against more moderate voices such as trump’s daughter, ivanka, and top economic adviser, gary cohn. in the end, trump stuck to a promise that he had made on the campaign trail last year aimed at helping blue collar workers who he feels are under siege in a changing u.s. economy. “i was elected to represent the citizens of pittsburgh, not pars,” he said on thursday in making his announcement. but trump’s intentions concerning the paris accord were unclear even to some of his aides until the last day or so, since he has shown flexibility on some campaign promises and had gotten an earful about the need to stay in the agreement from key allies at a group of seven summit last week in sicily. at the white house, the behind the scenes debate about whether to stay in paris or bolt was an intense one that dragged on for weeks. ivanka trump, whose husband, jared kushner, is a senior white house adviser, had been quietly urging her father to keep the united states in the paris agreement, and had sought to ensure her father heard all sides in the debate, an official said. cohn last week suggested trump might be softening on his outright hostility toward the accord, telling reporters the president’s position was “evolving” based on input from world leaders who wanted the united states to remain in the agreement. kushner, on the other hand, came around to the view that the standards set out in the agreement did not work for the u.s. economy, a senior administration official said. the official said the question for kushner was whether to try to change those standards within the agreement or pull out. consistently in favor of pulling out were bannon and trump speechwriter stephen miller, who was involved in writing trump’s paris remarks, and scott pruitt, administrator of the environmental protection agency. both bannon and miller are seen as key architects of trump’s “america first” agenda, which is aimed at ensuring u.s. interests are taken into account over a globalist view. although there had been some discussion of keeping the united states in the paris accord, while changing its carbon emissions commitments, as a way of maintaining global unity, in the end, trump decided to cut the cord entirely. “i think the president’s legal team felt very strongly that it was best, that the cleanest way to address it was to just get out,” a senior administration official told reporters.

" pennsylvania governor tom wolf on thursday nominated the state’s inspector general to serve as interim attorney general until november’s election, temporarily replacing kathleen kane, who resigned the post earlier this week after her conviction for perjury. bruce beemer, who previously served under kane as first deputy in the attorney general’s office, will have to be confirmed by the state senate. wolf said in a statement that he had already conferred with both republican and democratic leaders in the senate and expected a quick confirmation. beemer would hold the job until a successor is elected in november for a four year term, and then return to his role as inspector general. kane announced her resignation on tuesday, a day after a jury convicted her of leaking sealed grand jury material to a news reporter in an effort to embarrass a political rival. the move will likely end a brief stint as acting attorney general for bruce castor, whom kane had hired as her second in command earlier this year. in a statement, castor said the governor was fulfilling his duties under the law. “i will do all within my power to see that the office of attorney general is in the best possible shape for whenever the next attorney general arrives,” castor said. castor, the former montgomery county district attorney, made headlines earlier this year when he testified at a hearing for comedian bill cosby in his sexual assault case. castor said he had agreed not to prosecute cosby if the entertainer testified in a civil case brought by his accuser. but a court ruled castor’s claims were not enough to prevent the current district attorney from bringing charges. kane’s conviction, meanwhile, ended what had once been seen as a promising political career. prosecutors said kane believed former state prosecutor frank fina was behind a 2014 newspaper article that said she had abandoned a corruption investigation into philadelphia officials. in an effort to take revenge, prosecutors said, kane leaked sealed details about a separate investigation that fina declined to pursue and then lied about having done so to a grand jury investigating the matter. kane had portrayed the charges as politically motivated, after she revealed lewd emails exchanged among judges, state officials and prosecutors that she discovered while re examining the jerry sandusky molestation investigation. several officials, including two state supreme court justices, lost their jobs in the wake of the email scandal, dubbed “porngate.” ",0
" new jersey governor chris christie’s administration sued cash strapped gambling hub atlantic city on monday, seeking to freeze city spending until it remits the millions of dollars it owes to its school district. in the civil action, state education commissioner david hespe said atlantic city owed the district $82 million of tax revenues collected for the school year. the city already paid $48 million of that, but must still remit the remaining $34 million by july 15, court documents showed. that might be impossible. as of april 1, the city had only $8 million of cash available for operations. second quarter tax collections that begin in may will not provide enough to fund required disbursements, the lawsuit said. christie is seeking to stop the city from making its $3.2 million payroll on friday, he said in a televised press conference. the state sued “to protect the property tax collections that rightfully belong to the atlantic city school district and the children and families they serve,” christie said. in new jersey, cities must act as collection agents by collecting property taxes on behalf of school districts and  transmitting the money to them.  the lawsuit is the latest in christie’s high stakes game of chicken against city officials and some lawmakers over whether to take over the city’s operations to avoid bankruptcy. christie and state senate leaders say city officials have not done enough to stop the bleeding. they supported a legislative package that links a full state takeover with one that would provide immediate revenue for the city. the nearly insolvent city has been under state oversight since 2011. mayor don guardian threatened to close city hall for three weeks beginning on friday afternoon because it will not have enough money to pay workers after that. christie twice vetoed   even after winning changes he sought   legislation aimed at stabilizing the city’s tax base by letting casinos make fixed payments in lieu of property taxes. the city’s state approved budget relied on those revenues. in february, christie pinned that legislation to the takeover measure, which guardian initially supported but later called a “fascist dictatorship.” the package is now stalled in the state assembly, where speaker vincent prieto has refused to bring it to a vote because he says its goal is to dismantle collective bargaining agreements.  on monday, moody’s investors service downgraded the city deeper into junk territory, to caa3.

" venezuela s pro government legislative superbody ruled on wednesday that parties who boycotted this month s local elections had lost legitimacy, potentially eliminating the main opposition groups from the 2018 presidential race. the decree by the constituent assembly   created in a controversial july vote boycotted by the opposition and widely condemned abroad   infuriated venezuela s opposition and drew criticism from the united states.   the venezuelan government and its illegitimate constituent assembly are inventing rules as they go along. this is not democracy,  the u.s. embassy said on twitter. the justice first, democratic action and popular will parties did not run candidates in this month s mayoral polls in protest against what they said was a biased election system designed to perpetuate leftist president nicolas maduro s  dictatorship.  maduro had warned that could cost them participation in future votes and the constituent assembly echoed that position on wednesday, saying the parties had lost their legal status and should re apply to the national election board. given that the board is pro maduro and authorities are constantly throwing up obstacles to the opposition, that could well mean those parties are now effectively unable to run in the presidential election due before the end of 2018. maduro, 55, is expected to run for re election despite the disastrous state of the economy in venezuela, where millions are skipping meals and struggling to survive amid one of the world s highest inflation rates and widespread shortages of basics. two of his potentially biggest rivals already cannot run against him: popular will leader leopoldo lopez is under house arrest, while justice first leader henrique capriles is prohibited from holding political office.  we alert the world and all democratic governments that banning opposition political parties is yet another measure by the dictatorship that deserves rejection and condemnation,  said capriles  party colleague tomas guanipa. maduro and his allies say the constituent assembly has brought peace to the opec nation after months of opposition protests earlier this year in which more than 125 people were killed. demonstrators said they were fighting for freedom, but the government condemned them as violent subversives.   it s time for the coupsters to face the constitution. let no one undermine the people s participation and the democratic system,  constituent assembly head delcy rodriguez said after the passage of wednesday s measure.

" president vladimir putin warned on friday that the standoff between north korea and the united states was close to spilling into a large scale conflict and said it was a mistake to try to pressure pyongyang into halting its nuclear missile program.    putin, due to attend a summit of the brics nations in china next week, said the only way to de escalate tensions was via talks, and sergei lavrov, his foreign minister, said washington not pyongyang should take the initiative on that.   it is essential to resolve the region s problems through direct dialogue involving all sides without advancing any preconditions (for such talks),  putin, whose country shares a border with north korea, wrote on the kremlin s web site.    provocations, pressure, and bellicose and offensive rhetoric is the road to nowhere.  the russian leader, whose nuclear capable bombers recently overflew the korean peninsula in a show of force, said the  situation had deteriorated so badly that it was now  balanced on the verge of a large scale conflict.  pyongyang has been working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states and recently threatened to land missiles near the u.s. pacific territory of guam.  on monday, north korea, which sees joint war games between the united states and south korea as preparations for invasion, raised the stakes by firing an intermediate range missile over japan.  in russia s opinion the calculation that it is possible to halt north korea s nuclear missile programs exclusively by putting pressure on pyongyang is erroneous and futile,  putin wrote. a road map formulated by moscow and beijing, which would involve north korea halting its missile program in exchange for the united states and south korea stopping large scale war games, was a way to reduce tensions, wrote putin. lavrov, addressing students in moscow, said he felt events were building towards a war which he said would cause large numbers of casualties in japan and south korea if it happened.  if we want to avoid a war the first step must be taken by the side that is the more intelligent and stronger,  said lavrov, making clear he was referring to the united states.  he said russia was working behind the scenes and that moscow knew that washington had a back channel to pyongyang which he said he hoped would allow the two sides to de escalate.

" with trouble facing him back home, u.s. president donald trump ended his nine day overseas journey in dramatic fashion on saturday, addressing u.s. troops at a campaign style rally. trump flipped traditional u.s. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the middle east and europe, coddling middle eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional european allies pay more for their defense. at a group of seven summit in the resort town of taormina on the island of sicily, trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain u.s. support for the paris climate agreement, insisting he needed more time to make up his mind. in a hangar at naval air station sigonella, which is also on sicily, trump was introduced by his wife melania, who has raised eyebrows during the trip by twice flicking away her husband’s hand when he tried to hold hers. “my husband worked very hard on this trip and i am very proud of him,” she said. trump, whose marine one helicopter landed from taormina to the soaring soundtrack of the “air force one” movie, emerged from two days of closed door summitry to declare his trip a success. trump said he had helped forge more international cooperation in the fight against islamist militants, a threat he said was underscored by a suicide bomber in manchester, england, and the killing of coptic christians in egypt. “it was a tremendously productive meeting where i strengthen american bonds,” said trump. “we have great bonds with other countries and, with some of our closest allies, we concluded a truly historic week.” trump skipped the traditional end of trip news conference to avoid facing questions about a host of problems he faces upon his return to washington later on saturday. his may 9 firing of former fbi director james comey has raised concerns about whether he was trying to squelch a federal probe into his campaign’s ties with russia last year. the questions have been intensified in the wake of disclosures on friday that a senior adviser, jared kushner, the husband of trump’s daughter ivanka, had contacts with the russians in december about opening a secret back channel of communications with moscow. trump used his trip to promote “america first” policies,  promoting $110 billion worth of arms sales to saudi arabia and telling g 7 allies that the united states needs a more level playing field on trade. his body language on the trip demonstrated his typically brash behavior, dramatized by his demands that nato allies pay more for their defense and his refusal to explicitly declare that the united states backs article 5 of the alliance’s charter, which requires each member to come to the defense of each other. his pushing aside of the prime minister of montenegro to get in place for a family photo generated headlines across europe. at sigonella, trump said his appeals to nato allies to pay more was working. “money is starting to flow in,” he said. “it’s only fair to the united states. we’re behind nato all the way. but we want to be treated fairly.” ",0
" the united states said on monday it would fund rural media outlets in hungary to help train and equip journalists in defense of an independent media it sees subject to growing pressure and intimidation. hungarian prime minister viktor orban has increased media control by legal changes, regulatory steps and takeovers of outlets by business sector associates. the moves have alarmed western partners with the approach of elections, due in april 2018, which he is widely expected to win comfortably. the trend was especially strong in rural hungary, where government controlled public media and a handful of outlets friendly to the ruling fidesz party are the only news sources most people get. that is where the $700,000 u.s. program focuses.  the department of state... seeks a partner for the united states government who will help educate journalists and aspiring journalists on how to practise their trade,  a state department official said in a statement emailed to reuters.  the united states has publicly and privately expressed our concerns about the status of the free press in hungary on multiple occasions,  the official said.  hungary has committed to upholding these standards.  the government had no immediate comment. the program offers technical and financial assistance to media outlets, as well as increased local and international exposure, small grants and other tools. they can use the funds after may 2018. washington denied entry to top officials of his government on corruption charges in 2014, and orban ruffled feathers with attacks on the u.s. chartered central european university, an issue yet to be resolved. the u.s. bureau of democracy, human rights and labor launched the program after the top u.s. diplomat in budapest cited an erosion of media freedoms.  there are still independent and opposition media outlets here that are able to practise journalism with broad editorial freedom,  charg  d affaires david kostelancik said last month at a journalism conference.  that is a good thing.   however, their numbers are dwindling, and they face challenges in the advertising market that the pro government outlets do not. they face pressure and intimidation... as a result, fewer and fewer hungarians are exposed to the robust debate and discussion that is so important   in fact fundamental   to a representative democracy.  foreign ministry state secretary levente magyar, reacting to those comments, said the government would  continue to reject all statements that affect hungarian internal affairs and are based on misrepresentation in the strongest possible terms . the organisation for security and cooperation in europe, an intergovernmental human rights and media freedom watchdog, has said media pluralism has declined in hungary.

" u.s. president elect donald trump’s son in law, jared kushner, will become a senior white house adviser working on trade and the middle east, transition officials said on monday, in a rare case of a close presidential family member taking a major job. kushner, 35, who is married to trump’s daughter ivanka, is taking the post after receiving legal counsel that doing so would not violate u.s. anti nepotism law, transition officials said. the position, unlike cabinet posts, does not require u.s. senate confirmation, and kushner will not be paid. trump, in a statement on monday announcing the choice, said kushner was a “tremendous asset and trusted advisor throughout the campaign and transition.” kushner, who like trump is a new york real estate developer, emerged as an important voice early in his father in law’s presidential campaign and was involved in almost every aspect of it from personnel decisions to strategy and fundraising. ivanka trump, who like her husband has been a close adviser to the president elect, will not take on a role in her father’s white house but will focus on settling her family in washington. kushner and his wife will undertake significant divestments of their wide ranging financial portfolios as they prepare for their move to washington from new york and face inevitable questions about a potential conflict of interest. senior transition officials and a lawyer for kushner laid out the arrangement in a conference call with a small group of reporters. kushner is to work closely with incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus and senior strategist steve bannon in advising the new president, and the officials said he would focus at least at first on trade policy and the middle east. trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has vowed to rewrite international trade deals to make them more favorable to the united states. he has also pledged to move the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv, where it has been for 68 years, to jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as israel’s capital despite international objections. jamie gorelick, a new york lawyer who served as deputy attorney general for democratic president bill clinton and helped advise kushner, said his new post would not violate a 1967 anti nepotism statute.  she said congress in 1978 authorized the president to hire personnel for the white house office “without regard” to federal personnel laws like the anti nepotism statute and that court rulings had determined the white house was not an “agency” under the anti nepotism law. “i’m not saying that there isn’t an argument on the other side, and i respect the people who have made the argument on the other side. i just think we have the better argument,” gorelick said. richard briffault, a government ethics expert at columbia law school, disagreed, saying: “given the fact that the president is specifically mentioned, you would think that someone that is working for the president would be covered” by the anti nepotism law. bill clinton aroused controversy in 1993 when he named his wife, hillary clinton, to lead his healthcare reform drive. she lost the nov. 8 election to trump. after john f. kennedy was elected president in 1960, he chose his brother robert as attorney general. late on monday, a group of six democrats on the house of representatives judiciary committee said they had written to the justice department and u.s. office of government ethics asking them to review concerns about nepotism and conflicts of interest arising from kushner’s appointment. in order to comply with federal ethics laws and after consulting the office of government ethics, kushner will take a number of steps to divest substantial assets, gorelick said. kushner will resign from his positions as chief executive of the kushner companies and as publisher of the new york observer newspaper and divest from any interests in the new york observer, thrive capital, the 666 fifth avenue office building in midtown manhattan and any foreign investments.  in addition, kushner will recuse himself from participating in matters that could have a direct effect on his remaining financial interests. those interests include real estate in the new york area, ivanka trump’s interest in the new trump hotel in washington and the ivanka trump brand fashion business, the officials said. kushner will file a public financial disclosure form. norman eisen, a former ethics chief under president barack obama, said in an email that kushner’s ethics and disclosure moves appeared to be a “positive step.” “i hope his father in law takes a page from his book and does the same, as presidents have for the past four decades, by divesting into a blind trust or the equivalent,” eisen said. trump has said he would transfer control of his business to his children, but he has given no details. a planned news conference in december on the topic was canceled. trump is expected to take questions from reporters this week.

" the chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee said on wednesday he did not expect congress to lift the half century long embargo against cuba this year but it could happen under a new president, if there are changes in havana. president barack obama has been moving quickly toward more normal relations with havana in the past 14 months but the crippling trade embargo is one of the remaining major obstacles. “it’s not going to happen this year but i think it’s something that could happen as we move into a new president(‘s administration),” republican senator bob corker told journalists at a breakfast sponsored by the christian science monitor. “if cuba were to evolve its behavior and people were able to see results from what’s happening with the executive order changes that are occurring, then i think it’s possible,” he said. obama and cuban president raul castro announced in december 2014 that they would normalize relations after decades of hostility. those changes have been strongly opposed by many congressional republicans, who say cuba needs to do more to improve human rights before trade is eased. obama, a democrat, has used his executive powers to ease restrictions on travel and trade. his administration just announced that next month obama would become the first u.s. president to visit havana since 1928. but the u.s. trade embargo, imposed on the communist ruled nation in 1960, cannot be lifted without congressional approval. republicans control congress and although several agree with the overwhelming majority of democrats who want the embargo ended, the party’s congressional leaders are strongly opposed. corker has not taken a position but has noted in the past that the embargo has not changed cuban policy. the politics are more complicated because two cuban american senators vying for the republican presidential nomination, marco rubio and ted cruz, are vocal opponents of obama’s policy and party leaders are unlikely to come out against them during the campaign. corker said things are already changing, although havana still needs to change. “to me it appears that things are gradually moving along. we have air flights that are now going in, and it seems to me that this is going to be a year where those things take hold,” corker said. “obviously there’s still tremendous human rights abuses that are taking place in cuba,” he said.

" the trump administration and top republicans in u.s. congress are within a few weeks of agreeing on central aspects of a tax overhaul plan that will determine the contours of legislation now expected in september, an administration official told reuters this week. under pressure from business groups and rank and file republicans, trump officials and congressional leaders still need to decide how much to slash tax rates and if the package should increase the federal budget deficit, administration and congressional sources said. the future of a border adjustment tax, or bat, proposal from house of representatives republicans, meant to boost exports and discourage imports, could also be decided within the next two to three weeks, the administration official said. president donald trump has pledged to make a tax overhaul a priority. but after 20 weeks in power and numerous distractions, he has yet to offer a tax bill to congress. expectations for legislation have slipped repeatedly, from spring to summer and now after the u.s. labor day holiday.   still, stocks are up since trump’s november election win and companies and wealthy americans are positioning themselves to realize more income in 2018, betting lower taxes are coming. the head of the house freedom caucus, a bloc of three dozen conservatives capable of stalling legislation, on friday called on republicans to acknowledge a lack of consensus on the bat and produce a tax proposal by the end of july. trump and fellow republicans pledged in the election campaign last year to tackle in 2017 the biggest tax overhaul since the reagan era. but that agenda has been slowed by infighting over dismantling obamacare and probes of possible ties between trump’s campaign and alleged russian meddling in the 2016 election. the business roundtable, a powerful lobbying group that represents chief executives, wrote to trump and congressional leaders this week calling for a “shift from listening to action” on tax reform. the administration official, who asked not to be named, said there is broad agreement among participants in the talks on the need to cut taxes, simplify the code, eliminate tax breaks, end taxation of u.s. corporate overseas profits and repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in corporate profits held overseas.  but key details remain open to question. more meetings are expected among u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin, white house economic adviser gary cohn, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell, house speaker paul ryan, house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady and senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch and their staff, the official said. after their third meeting on tuesday, officials had not decided whether to adopt full expensing for corporations, the administration official said. the policy would allow companies to write off the cost of capital investments such as equipment immediately and plow the money back into their businesses.  the official said the aim of the talks is to agree on a framework by mid year and release legislation soon after lawmakers’ long august recess. a key decision awaits the house republicans’ export boosting bat, intended to help pay for reforms while dissuading companies from moving assets, profits and jobs abroad. the bat, which would tax imports but exempt export revenues from taxation, has run afoul of many republicans and drawn criticism from the administration. officials in congress and the administration are examining options to the bat that could reduce erosion of the federal tax base, including rules and a minimum corporate tax. decisions on bat, revenue neutrality and expensing will help decide if congress can cut the corporate income tax to 15 percent, as trump seeks, or 20 25 percent as envisioned by the house republicans’ tax plan.

" a federal judge on wednesday upheld president donald trump’s pardon earlier this year of 85 year old former arizona sheriff joe arpaio, rejecting legal challenges by outside groups. u.s. district judge susan bolton said that she had considered the petitions filed by the american civil liberties union of arizona and other organizations, including one staffed by lawyers who worked for former democratic president barack obama’s administration, but found no legal grounds to overturn the pardon. bolton did not rule on a request by arpaio’s attorneys to take the further step of vacating his conviction.   trump, a republican who has promised to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, has praised arpaio’s crackdown on illegal immigrants in maricopa county, arizona, that drew condemnation from civil rights groups. arpaio was convicted in july of willfully violating a 2011 injunction barring his officers from stopping and detaining latino motorists solely on suspicion they were in the country illegally. he had not yet been sentenced when trump issued the pardon in august.

" russia and the united states agreed to set up a working group to try to mend their battered ties on wednesday after u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson held lengthy talks in moscow with president vladimir putin and the russian foreign minister. it was not clear until the last minute whether putin would grant tillerson an audience, but the fact that he did is likely to be seen as a sign that moscow has not given up on the new u.s. administration and wants to try to improve ties which both sides agree are languishing at a post cold war low. a joint news conference between sergei lavrov, the russian foreign minister, and tillerson showed how much work there is to do though as the russian used many of his speaking opportunities to lambast washington over its actions in syria and what he said was its unhelpful foreign interference in the past. tillerson, on his first visit to russia in his current role, struck a more conciliatory stance, but said ties and trust levels were at a low point and restated washington’s position that syrian president bashar al assad must eventually relinquish power, a position starkly at odds with russia. “there is a low level of trust between our two countries,” tillerson said. “the world’s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship.” lavrov said that while russia was not placing its hopes in assad or any other individual in syria, toppling the syrian government was not an option and that a political process had to be allowed to play out.  “we discussed assad today,” said lavrov. “i don’t remember any positive examples of how a dictator was overthrown and everything was just fine afterwards.” differences over a u.s. missile strike on a syrian air base last week also bubbled to the surface.  washington says it acted to punish the syrian government for what it said was a devastating nerve gas attack damascus launched against its own people that killed scores. russia said the u.s. strike was illegal though and lavrov repeated moscow’s stance on wednesday, saying an international investigation should be left to determine who was to blame and what happened.  it was wrong to blame assad without knowing the facts, he said.  tillerson said the united states was confident that assad’s forces were behind the gas attack, but said there was “no firm information” to indicate russian forces were involved in the same attack. in a move that slightly softened the atmosphere, lavrov said putin had agreed to restore a u.s. russia air safety agreement covering syria which moscow suspended in retaliation for the u.s. missile strikes. the agreement would be reactivated with immediate effect, viktor ozerov, the head of the russian upper house of parliament’s defense committee told the ria news agency.

" the top democrat on the senate environment committee on monday asked the environmental protection agency’s internal watchdog to audit a recent trip to morocco by the agency’s head to determine if it was in line with the epa’s mission. epa administrator scott pruitt, in a trip to morocco last week, promoted u.s. liquefied natural gas. senator tom carper asked epa inspector general arthur elkins to expand its current audit of pruitt’s travel to include the trip to morocco as part of a u.s. trade mission. “i request that you review the purpose of administrator pruitt’s travels to determine whether his activities during each trip are in line with epa’s mission ‘to protect human health and the environment,’” carper wrote in the letter to elkins. traditionally, the epa, which regulates clean air and water, does not promote the u.s. energy industry.  last week, the epa announced that pruitt attended bilateral meetings in morocco where he “outlined u.s. environmental priorities for updating the environmental work plan under the u.s. morocco free trade agreement and the potential benefit of liquefied natural gas (lng) imports on morocco’s economy.” liquefied natural gas is produced by cooling natural gas until it is condensed into a liquid, allowing it to be shipped via tanker instead of moved by pipeline. it is reconverted into gas at the other end.  when asked why the head of the epa was involved in touting lng, epa spokesman jahan wilcox said pruitt discussed the role of u.s. technology and innovation abroad, “including but not limited to lng.” it “only serves to emphasize the importance this administration has placed on promoting u.s. businesses,” wilcox said.  carper said the morocco travel has cost taxpayers $40,000 and that gas exports do not fall within the agency’s jurisdiction. the inspector general’s office is already reviewing all travel by pruitt conducted until sept. 30 after democratic lawmakers asked for a review of pruitt’s frequent travels to oklahoma, his home state.

" a swiss man was handed a suspended prison term of nearly two years and a fine on thursday for spying on a german tax authority, in a case that has pitted swiss bank secrecy against germany s clampdown on tax evasion. the penalty was relatively modest as spying for a foreign state is punishable in germany by up to five years in prison, but the frankfurt court said the man, identified only as daniel m., had no prior convictions and had made a full confession. daniel m., 54, had tried to get the personal contact details of german tax officials for swiss intelligence, which wanted to prosecute them for obtaining secret bank data. german states including the one in question, north rhine westphalia, have over the past few years gotten hold of cds containing details of bank accounts held secretly in switzerland by germans hoping to avoid tax. swiss authorities say this amounts to the theft of business secrets, while german officials say they are combating illegal tax evasion. lawyers for daniel m., whose spying activities lasted from 2011 until 2015, had argued that their client was simply a  patriot  caught between two ideologies. the court, which handed him a suspended prison term of a year and 10 months and a fine of 40,000 euros ($46,392), acknowledged that he had suffered considerable financial damage since being detained in frankfurt in may. but it also criticized his cooperation with swiss intelligence over a period of at least two and a half years.  the depiction of the defendant s actions as those of a swiss patriot did not convince the court, especially because tax evasion, the reason for the tax officials  actions, is not considered morally protected behavior in switzerland either,  the court said in a statement. the swiss banking act requires employees of swiss regulated banks to keep client information confidential, but a number of staff have leaked account details to foreign authorities in the past decade as western governments crack down on tax evasion. whistleblowers and new disclosure standards have proven costly for swiss banks, which have suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in outflows as a result. over a third of swiss private banks have permanently closed.

" some of democratic u.s. representative john conyers’ colleagues in the congressional black caucus (cbc) are pressing the 88 year old lawmaker to resign amid sexual harassment allegations against him, two senior house democratic aides said on tuesday. the aides, who asked not to be identified, did not say how many lawmakers were involved in the effort but confirmed a report by cnn that it was under way. one aide said democratic representative cedric richmond, the cbc chairman, was active in the move to get conyers to step down and end a house of representatives career that began with his first election in 1964. richmond issued a statement after meeting with conyers on tuesday that said: “any decision to resign from office before the ethics investigation is complete is john’s decision to make.” richmond said he had a “very candid conversation” with conyers “about the seriousness of the allegations against him, which he vehemently denies.” “the congressional black caucus calls on congress to treat all members who have been accused of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other crimes with parity, and we call on congress and the public to afford members with due process as these very serious allegations are investigated,” richmond said. the michigan congressman is the longest serving house member and the dean of the cbc. aides to conyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. on sunday, conyers said he was stepping down as the senior democrat on the house judiciary committee pending a congressional ethics investigation. he has denied allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances to some women who worked for him, but said his office had resolved a harassment case with a payment and no admission of guilt. conyers’ troubles come as sexual harassment accusations in recent weeks have ensnared former hollywood executive harvey weinstein and other politicians, including republican senate candidate roy moore of alabama and democratic senator al franken of minnesota. the cbc was founded in 1971 and has 49 members in the house and senate. it is an influential voice within the democratic party. following conyers’ announcement on sunday that he was stepping down as the ranking house judiciary committee democrat, house democratic leader nancy pelosi called for “zero tolerance” on sexual harassment. if conyers were to resign, a special election would be held to fill his seat.

" german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the social democrats (spd) have agreed to exploratory talks on forming a new government starting on jan. 7, both parties said on wednesday after informal discussions. the decision, 87 days after a national election that returned a fragmented parliament and complicated coalition arithmetic, brightens prospects for a renewal of the  grand coalition  that governed germany over the past four years. a repeat coalition is merkel s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor after talks on forming a three way alliance with two smaller parties broke down, leaving europe s largest economy in an unprecedented state of uncertainty.  it was a good discussion in a trusting atmosphere,  the parties said in a joint statement after leaders met on wednesday. they agreed to hold four days of talks from jan. 7, with the aim of deciding by jan. 12 whether to open formal coalition negotiations. even in the most optimistic case, germany will have smashed 2013 s post world war two record of needing 86 days to form a new government after an election. the hiatus highlights that germany, long europe s bastion of stability, is not immune to the political fragmentation that has swept the continent. the conservatives and social democrats have identified 15 policy areas for exploration, including education, the welfare state and employment law, where the spd is keen to carve out a distinctive left wing identity for itself after a disastrous election showing blamed in part on merkel s dominant stature. the spd s membership, which tends to be more radical than the party leadership, will have to ratify any decision to repeat a coalition with merkel, who has been in power for 12 years.

" the republican chairman of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee said on monday that if the house of representatives does not pass a russian sanctions bill, it is because members do not want to impose new sanctions, not because of a procedural issue cited by republican leaders in the house.  “there is no issue, except do they want to pass a russia sanctions bill or not,” senator bob corker told reporters at the u.s. senate. the senate passed the sanctions measure by 98 2 on june 15, but it has been stalled in the house, where president donald trump’s fellow republicans hold a larger majority than in the senate. house republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the house, not the senate. they also blamed democrats for holding it up. democrats, and some republicans, scoffed. they said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the house in a matter of minutes. trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get congress’ permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons. some republicans have also echoed concerns raised by u.s. energy firms and european governments that the legislation could complicate investment in russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs. corker said the bill was written to allow the trump administration to address energy related issues. and he said any white house would prefer to conduct foreign policy without congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill. “no one has called me and said, ‘we don’t want this legislation to pass.’ that has never occurred,” corker said. lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure. the senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on june 29, with a “fix” to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the house. house republicans said on monday that the senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the senate would have to change it and vote again.

" u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s full remarks to several wall street audiences appeared to become public on saturday when the controversial transparency group wikileaks dumped its latest batch of hacked emails. the documents showed comments by clinton during question and answer sessions with goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein and tim o’neill, the bank’s head of investment management, at three separate events in 2013 in arizona, new york and south carolina.  some excerpts of clinton’s speeches had already been released. for more than a week, wikileaks has published in stages what it says are hacked emails from the account of john podesta, clinton’s campaign chairman.  clinton’s campaign has declined to verify the emails. goldman sachs did not immediately provide any comment on saturday. clinton came under fire for months for not releasing full details of her paid speeches to big business audiences, as opponents accused her of a cozy relationship with bankers and other members of the u.s. financial system. the excerpts that have surfaced so far angered voters who backed clinton’s former democratic opponent, u.s. senator bernie sanders, who endorsed her after losing the party’s primary. few of these voters are expected to vote for republican nominee donald trump, who is dealing with his own larger scandal after the release last week of a 2005 video in which he bragged about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. but democratic strategists worry that disappointment with clinton could hurt turnout in the nov. 8 election among liberals and younger voters, posing a potential problem for the former secretary of state. in the email released on saturday containing the transcripts, clinton campaign staff highlighted sections that could pose problems, including saying “political reasons” factored into passing the 2010 dodd frank law on wall street reforms and, while talking about regulation, saying the people who work in the industry know it best.

" a commander in iran s elite revolutionary guards and a lower ranking iranian fighter have been killed fighting islamic state in syria in recent days, iranian media reported on sunday. the revolutionary guards, iran s most powerful military force which also oversees an economic empire worth billions of dollars, have been fighting in support of syrian president bashar al assad for several years. an iranian official told the tasnim news agency last year that more than 1,000 iranians have been killed in syria. senior members of the guards have been among those killed. kheyrollah samadi, a guards commander in charge of a unit in syria, died on thursday in fighting in the albu kamal region, bordering iraq, according to fars news. samadi was killed in clashes with islamic state, according to the ghatreh news site. iranian media have previously reported on fighting in that area between iran s shi ite militia allies and islamic state. the syrian army and its allies took complete control over albu kamal, islamic state s last significant town in syria, a military news service run by hezbollah said on sunday. samadi, who fought in the iran iraq war during the 1980s and had retired from the iranian military before signing on to go to syria, was killed by a mortar explosion, fars news, a news agency, said. iranian news sites posted pictures on sunday of samadi with qassem soleimani, head of the guards branch responsible for operations outside iran. the lower ranking iranian fighter, mehdi movahednia, was killed on saturday in clashes with islamic state in the town of mayadin in eastern syria, fars news reported. the revolutionary guards initially kept quiet about their role in the syria conflict. but in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the sunni muslim fighters of islamic state who see shi ites, the majority of iran s population, as apostates. on web sites linked to the guards, members of the organization killed in syria and iraq are praised as protectors of shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine . u.s. president donald trump last month gave the u.s. treasury department authority to impose economic sanctions on members of the iranian revolutionary guard in response to what washington calls its efforts to destabilize and undermine its opponents in the middle east.

" environmentally conscious investors are using their pocketbooks to protest president donald trump’s plans to slash environmental regulations, fueling a rally in funds that only invest in companies that meet progressive criteria for sustainability. from the start of november to the end of january, investors poured $1.8 billion into actively managed equities funds in the “socially responsible” category, according to lipper data. in the same period, there was a net outflow of $133 billion from funds that do not have environmental or social mandates. trump was elected president on nov. 8. investors worried that trump’s policies may imperil causes they believe in are hoping an influx of flows will help keep companies alive. “if clients see the federal government withdrawing from a space they think is important, they may actually be more active in wanting to enforce their views through the dollars allocated,” said vincent reinhart, chief economist at standish mellon asset management. the inflows are a boon for fund managers but also a challenge, requiring them to find companies whose share prices have a chance to climb despite less favorable federal policies. for instance, shares of solar energy companies took a beating after the election, sliding 11 percent by year end on concerns the future of u.s. tax credits under a trump administration, though they have recovered somewhat since then. still, cautious fund managers from fidelity, new alternatives, calvert investments and others are scrutinizing water technology and wind power shares, which should benefit from new federal infrastructure spending and a push by states such as california toward more renewable power generation. managers say water technology stocks should see an uptick from trump’s campaign promise to spend $1 trillion on repairing and improving the country’s infrastructure. wind stocks are attractive as that energy source is proving more cost effective in growing areas of the country like california, which plans to get half its energy from renewable sources by 2030.  “if you look at where the policy is changing the fastest, it’s at the state level, and we see places like california continuing on that trend regardless of what is happening on the federal level,” said kevin walenta, who manages the fidelity select environment and alternative energy portfolio. he has been adding to his positions in spanish wind energy company iberdrola sa and us based water and plumbing company comfort systems usa inc. trump has not yet called for ending tax credits for solar and other renewable energy, though he has expressed doubt about the role of solar energy, bemoaned the loss of coal mining jobs and blamed wind turbines for ruining picturesque landscapes. ahead of the election, power companies had already started to pivot away from solar and invest more in wind, with companies including southern co, nextera energy inc and xcel energy inc announcing plans to expand wind generating capabilities at a time when technology has helped lower its cost. [l1n1fz1gr].  wind power costs average between $32 and $62 per megawatt hour before subsidies, compared with an average between $49 and $61 per megawatt hour for utility scale solar arrays without subsidies, according to a december 2016 report from lazard. coal power, which trump has pledged to revive, costs between $60 and $143 per megawatt hour, the report notes. with that cost structure, along with the potential increase in jobs from building and maintaining wind turbines, even solidly republican states should continue to invest in renewables, said murray rosenblith, co portfolio manager of the new alternatives fund. rosenblith has been adding to his positions in wind companies vestas wind systems and gamesa corporacion tecnologica sa, both of whose shares are up 10 percent or more since the start of the year. “these are growing industries in states that are bringing back jobs,” he said. “even if trump wants to pull tax credits back as a political gesture he’s not going to find a lot of support in the party at large.” ",0
" police in the sicilian capital of palermo scooped up 25 suspected mobsters on an array of charges on tuesday, including a woman accused of filling in as boss for her imprisoned husband.   more than 200 police, two helicopters and five canine units took part in the early morning roundup of the suspects. they are accused of extortion, handling stolen goods, vandalism and being mafia members, according to the arrest warrant seen by reuters. with extensive use of wiretaps and ambient recordings, police reconstructed territorial divisions in the city and the internal power struggle that made maria angela di trapani, 49, a powerful figure inside one of the city s historic clans.  her husband, salvatore  salvino eyes of ice  madonia, who is in jail for murder. police said she carried messages from her husband to clan members and organized monthly payments to the families of imprisoned mobsters. she also designated who should be running the mob family s business, or who should be  acting boss , on behalf of her husband. in one wiretap, an accused clan member refers to her as  the mistress of the house , and the police statement on the arrests said she was the real boss of the resuttana neighborhood.  for all intents and purposes, she acts like a real man,  a turncoat told investigators, according to the court documents.  the sicilian mafia, or cosa nostra, has been hurt by a series of arrests in recent years, weakening the crime network, especially compared to the calabrian  ndrangheta. with many bosses in jail, their wives have begun to play larger roles.  while cosa nostra has been much weakened by the result of judicial investigations, this case shows the continuing ability to use violence, intimidation, and the mafia code to force business and shop owners to pay extortion,  the warrant reads. during the two year investigation, police documented 33 separate crimes and 22 attempts, many successful, to extort shops and businesses, police said.

" many people living near a crumbling dam in storm battered puerto rico have evacuated, governor ricardo rossello said on monday, as he asked for more government aid to avert a humanitarian crisis after hurricane maria. much of the caribbean island, a u.s. territory with a population of 3.4 million, is still without electricity five days after maria struck with ferocious winds and torrential rains, the most powerful hurricane to hit puerto rico in nearly a century. there have been growing concerns for some 70,000 people who live in the river valley below the guajataca dam in the island s northwest, where cracks were seen on friday in the 88 year old earthen structure. rossello said he was working on the assumption that the 120 foot (35 meter) dam would collapse.   i d rather be wrong on that front than doing nothing and having that fail and costing people lives,  he said in an interview with cnn.  most of the people in the near vicinity have evacuated.  it was unclear if the governor was saying that most of the 70,000 valley inhabitants had left the area, or only the several hundred people living in the small towns closest to the dam. about 320 people from those towns have moved to safety, according to local media. the fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the immense task facing disaster relief authorities after maria, which was the second major hurricane to strike the caribbean this month. the storm killed at least 29 people in the region, at least 10 of those in puerto rico, which was already battling an economic crisis.  rossello said that before the storms struck, he had been embarking on an aggressive fiscal agenda that included more than $1.5 billion in cuts.  this is a game changer,  he told cnn.  this is a completely different set of circumstances. this needs to be taken into consideration otherwise there will be a humanitarian crisis.  brock long, administrator of the federal emergency management agency (fema), and tom bossert, senior adviser to the department of homeland security, met with rossello on monday. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters in washington that the administration was engaged in a fact finding process to figure out how much help puerto rico needs.  the federal response has been anything but slow,  sanders said at the daily briefing.  in fact, there s been an unprecedented push through of billions of dollars in federal assistance that the administration has fought for.  many structures on puerto rico, including hospitals, remain badly damaged and flooded, with clean drinking water hard to find in some areas. few planes have been able to land or take off from damaged airports. the storm has also put a big strain on prepa, the island s electricity utility, which declared bankruptcy in july after accumulating a $9 billion debt and years of underinvestment. from preliminary fema reports, it is estimated that 55 percent of transmission towers may be down, and that more than 90 percent of the distribution system could have been destroyed. more than 91 percent of puerto rico s cellphone sites are also out of service, the federal communications commission said. there are more than 10,000 federal staff, including more than 700 people from fema, doing recovery work in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands, according to fema. the national weather service warned of further flash floods in the west of the island on monday as thunderstorms moved in. maria would likely be downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on tuesday night, the national hurricane center said. as of 2 p.m. edt (1800 gmt) on monday, the center said, it was about 300 miles (480 km) south southeast of cape hatteras, north carolina, heading slowly north.  the storm was unlikely to hit the continental united states directly, but the nhc said large swells were affecting the u.s. east coast. a tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the north carolina coast and officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors to ocracoke island in the outer banks that went into effect at 5 a.m. edt (0900 gmt) on monday.

" saudi arabia lifted a 35 year old ban on cinemas on monday, prompting celebrations from film fans, directors and movie chains eyeing the last untapped mass market in the middle east. the first theaters could start showing films as early as march, the government said, part of a liberalizing reform drive that has already opened the door to concerts, comedy shows, and women drivers over the past year. cinemas were banned in the early 1980s under pressure from islamists as saudi society turned towards a particularly conservative form of the religion that discouraged public entertainment and public mixing between men and women. but reforms led by 32 year old crown prince mohammed bin salman have eased many of those restrictions, as the government tries to broaden the economy and lessen its dependence on oil.  opening cinemas will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification,  said minister of culture and information awwad bin saleh alawwad.  by developing the broader cultural sector we will create new employment and training opportunities, as well as enriching the kingdom s entertainment options.  in a nod to conservatives, the government said the films would be censored to make sure they remain  in line with values and principles in place and do not contradict with sharia laws and moral values in the kingdom.  the details of that censorship were not announced, but could be extensive in a country where images of women are often crossed out on advertising. there was no immediate reaction from the kingdom s wahhabi clergy and conservative groups, who have responded to past suggestions about bringing back cinema with outraged social media campaigns. public objections to the reforms have been more muted in recent months, after authorities launched a spate of arrests clamping down on critics of the program. up to now, the kingdom s film pioneers have had to focus on foreign markets to get their works shown.  saudi arabia is always in the news, but it s nice to be in the news in this way,  said los angeles based saudi director haifaa al manour, who released the first full length feature shot entirely in the kingdom, wadjda, in 2012.  i feel like we re about to relive what egypt was like in the  50s,  she said, referring to the explosion of film making in what is now the epicenter of arabic popular cinema. prince mohammed has also sought to promote a more tolerant form of islam and crack down on extremism, a cause mansour said would be furthered by films.  if you want to fight terrorism, you need to give people a love of life. a love of life comes from joy, and cinema is joy.  thousands of saudis currently travel to bahrain, the united arab emirates and other countries for their entertainment. the government has said it wants to retain the money spent on those trips. regional cinema chains have also been eyeing the saudi market, keen to tap the spending power of the young people who make up roughly 70 percent of the kingdom s population. dubai based mall operator majid al futtaim, which owns the vox cinemas chain, said it wanted to open the first movie theater there.  we are very happy about this announcement, as you can imagine, we have been waiting for it for quite some time,  said chief executive alain bejjani. the government said it expected to open more than 300 cinemas with more than 2,000 screens by 2030, building an industry that would contribute more then 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create 30,000 permanent jobs over the same period. a commission chaired by alawwad will announce details of licensing and regulations over the next few weeks, it added. locations for the first cinemas are still under study, but would likely be in top population centers, fahad al muammar, the supervisor of cinema in the kingdom s general commission for audiovisual media, told state tv al ekhbariya.

" a man charged with trying to attack donald trump with a policeman’s gun found it hard to cope with life but did not have political views and was never violent, his father told british media on tuesday.    michael sandford was arrested after trying to grab a police officer’s side arm at a trump rally in las vegas on saturday. when asked why, he told police: “to shoot and kill trump,” according to u.s. court papers.  “he’s never shown any violent tendencies before. he’s never been a bad person,” his father, paul davey, was quoted as saying by the mailonline website which put sandford’s age as 20. u.s. prosecutors have said he is 19.   “he’s a nice kid and literally wouldn’t hurt a fly   he used to tell us not to use fly spray because he didn’t want any flies to die.” the mirror newspaper’s website quoted davey as saying his son had asperger’s syndrome and had left school at the age of 15 “because he couldn’t cope with it all”.  he went to the united states 18 months ago after an american girl he had met returned home, something that had made him “quite down and depressed,” davey said. “he’s been refusing to come back and we were worried about him, we were in contact with the american embassy ... (but) the american authorities said ‘he’s over 18 we can’t do anything.’” davey said someone must have coerced or “radicalised” his son into attacking the presidential candidate. “he has never mentioned donald trump. the reason it is such a shock is because he shows no interest in anything like that ... i doubt he would even know who the president of the united states is.” sandford lived on his own in dorking, a commuter town near london, in a flat in a large white house. a local who knew sandford’s mother, who did not want to be named, told reuters sandford had autism and obsessive compulsive disorder.  “he was one of those guys who just stays in his room that’s it, wouldn’t come out,” the man said.  the u.s. court documents said sandford had been planning to kill trump for about a year. he had visited a gun range the day before the rally to fire a weapon for the first time.  last week, a british member of parliament was shot and stabbed to death in the street   an incident that has shocked a country that has strict gun controls and where attacks on public figures are rare. media reported that sandford and his mother had taken part in a “robot wars” competition where contestants operate robots trying to destroy their opponents’ machine. a web page for the fighting robots association listed michael and lynne sandford and paul davey as owners of a number of robots, including machines named ‘mr nasty’, ‘x terminator’ and ‘steel avenger’.  “he was quite active in the robot community for a while   buying famous robots from the show ... i then got them working for him because he had absolutely no idea about robots,” john findlay, director of the company behind robot wars, told the mirror newspaper.   “he was calm, very quiet, a little bit weird and reserved.” ",0

" france s foreign minister said on wednesday that donald trump s verbal jousting with north korea was perhaps not the best method to handle the nuclear crisis and urged the u.s. president to focus his attention on raising diplomatic pressure on pyongyang. bellicose statements by trump and north korean leader kim jong un in recent weeks have created fears that a miscalculation could lead to action with untold ramifications, particularly since pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3.  trump s method is perhaps not the best, but at the same time we shouldn t mix up the responsibilities,  jean yves le drian told bfm tv.  the country that is breaking with nuclear international agreements is north korea. president trump is reacting forcefully to this, but without a doubt there is a way to act in a different way by putting pressure and sanctions.   north korean foreign minister ri yong ho on monday accused trump of declaring war on north korea and threatened that pyongyang would shoot down u.s. warplanes flying near the korean peninsula after american bombers flew close to it last saturday. the north korean minister was reacting to trump s twitter comments that kim and ri  won t be around much longer  if they acted on their threats toward the united states. le drian repeated that a maximum amount of pressure needed to be placed on pyongyang to get it back to the negotiating table, but warned there was a risk of an accidental military escalation.   the world is living in a dangerous period,  he said.  at the moment we re at a verbal clash, but there could be an incident. we need to avoid incidents.

" a group of democratic senators took their plans to tackle rising drug costs to president elect donald trump on tuesday, asking him to work with them and republicans on the issue. in a letter dated tuesday, the 19 senators named five areas for cooperation: allowing the medicare program to negotiate prescription prices, increasing transparency, stopping abusive pricing, passing reform on incentives for innovation and supporting generic competition for branded drugs. trump’s focus during the presidential election campaign was not on drug prices but on his promise to “repeal and replace” obamacare, president barack obama’s signature health reform law passed by democrats in 2010.  but he did talk about allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, and importing cheaper drugs from other countries. since elected, trump promised in an interview with time magazine that “i’m going to bring down drug prices” but did not say how. in the letter led by senators sherrod brown of ohio and al franken of minnesota and co signed by vermont senator bernie sanders, minnesota senator amy klobuchar and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren among others, the group suggested that there would be opportunities in congress for trump to steer bipartisan reform. it suggested that the prescription drug, generic drug, and biosimilars user fee agreement reauthorization, due to be passed in the spring, and “other health related legislative priorities” would be good opportunities.  republicans have a majority in congress and is working on a two part plan to “repeal and replace” obamacare, according to republican senators. the repeal would take place through the budget reconciliation process, which can pass with 51 votes. for replacement legislation, some republican senators have said they may seek democratic support in order to have bipartisan legislation with 60 votes.

" u.s. president donald trump does not like the “border adjustment” tax cooked up by u.s. house speaker paul ryan and other republicans in the house of representatives. at least, he does not like the term. “i don’t like the word ‘adjustment’, because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world,” trump told fox business news in an interview that aired on wednesday. “adjustment means we lose. we lose.” “let’s call it an import tax. let’s call it a reciprocal tax,” he added. “nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax.” trump was talking about a provision in ryan’s house republican tax blueprint that has polarized the tax reform debate, as the white house tries to score a much needed legislative victory by overhauling the u.s. tax code for the first time since the reagan era. the proposal would exempt u.s. corporate export revenues from federal taxes, while requiring u.s. companies to shoulder the same flat 20 percent tax rate on supplies and other purchased products, whether produced overseas or domestically. but the president appeared to favor an import tax that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origin’s tax rate for u.s. products. he said such an approach could take the form of trade policy rather than tax policy. “there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it,” the president said. “the other countries, if they’re charging you a 50 percent tax, you say: ‘o.k., whatever you charge, we’re charging’.” the house border adjustment tax, or bat, would help trump keep his campaign pledge to create manufacturing jobs, advocates say, by exempting u.s. export revenue from tax while subjecting imports to the same 20 percent corporate tax imposed on domestic products. but the measure has been angrily denounced by import dependent industries and rejected by enough senate republicans to call its political viability into question. in his fox interview, trump lamented the inequalities of the international tax system, saying u.s. products face high tax rates overseas while foreign made goods enter the u.s. market tax free. treasury secretary steven mnuchin floated the idea of a “reciprocal” tax in february, but administration officials have offered few details and lobbyists have suggested that it could strongly resemble the house bat proposal. “i love the idea of reciprocal,” trump said. “you can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax. there are numerous terms. but the reciprocal tax is very important.” ",0
" north korea has petitioned the russian parliament to help 3,500 migrant workers from the isolated asian country stay in russia despite new u.n. sanctions, the interfax news agency reported on friday, citing a russian lawmaker. tougher sanctions on north korea, imposed by the united nations security council over pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear programs on sept. 11, banned countries from providing new work permits for north korean nationals, but allowed existing workers to remain. most of the around 30,000 40,000 north korean migrants legally working in russia were hired before the new sanctions entered into force and the ban will not affect them, interfax said, quoting an earlier statement from maxim topilin, russia s labor minister.  but the ban could apply to 3,500 workers who only signed their contracts in september, the month when the u.n. security council, including russia, voted for the new sanctions, interfax reported. it cited kazbek taysayev, a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament and a member of a  friendship group  between the russian and north korean parliaments, as saying:  north korea s embassy officially addressed us. we supported them and sent our petitions in order to let these people stay so that they can work.  even if the workers signed their contracts after the ban took effect, they had started making arrangements and preparing the documents earlier and could be allowed to stay, said taysayev.  the u.n. resolution said it did not apply to work permits  for which written contracts have been finalized prior to the adoption of this resolution.  north korea s embassy in moscow was not available for immediate comment.

" u.s. supreme court justice anthony kennedy on monday provided a temporary reprieve for president trump’s order blocking most refugees from entering the united states, putting on hold a lower court’s ruling loosening the prohibition. kennedy’s action gave the nine justices more time to consider the justice department’s challenge filed on monday to the lower court’s decision allowing entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. the full supreme court could act within days. the justice department opted not to appeal another part of last thursday’s ruling by the san francisco based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals that related to trump’s ban on travelers from six muslim majority nations. the 9th circuit ruling broadened the number of people with exemptions to the ban to include grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal u.s. residents. without kennedy’s intervention, the appeals court decision would have gone into effect on tuesday. kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response to the trump administration’s filing by noon on tuesday. under the 9th u.s. circuit’s ruling, up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the united states than otherwise would be allowed, according to the administration. trump’s march 6 order banned travelers from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. the order, which replaced a broader january one that was blocked by federal courts, was one of the most contentious acts of his presidency. critics called it an unlawful “muslim ban” that made good on trump’s promise as a candidate of “a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” the broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against muslims in violation of the u.s. constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be argued before the supreme court on oct. 10. the supreme court in june partially revived the order after its provisions were blocked by lower courts. but the justices said a ban could be applied only to those without a “bona fide” relationship to people or entities in the united states. new litigation was brought by hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count. hawaii and other democratic led states, the american civil liberties union and refugee groups filed legal challenges after trump signed his order in march. “the trump administration has ended its odd and ill advised quest to ban grandmas from the country,” hawaii attorney general douglas chin said on monday. “with respect to the admission to the united states of refugees with formal assurances and the supreme court’s temporary stay order, each day matters,” chin added, promising to respond soon to the administration’s filing. in court papers filed earlier on monday, the justice department said the 9th circuit refugees decision “will disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order’s refugee provisions.” omar jadwat, an aclu lawyer, contrasted trump’s efforts to keep alive his travel ban with the republican president’s decision last week to rescind a program that protected from deportation people brought to the united states illegally as children, dubbed “dreamers.” “the extraordinary efforts the administration is taking in pursuit of the muslim ban stand in stark contrast to its unwillingness to take a single step to protect 800,000 dreamers,” jadwat said.

" about 20,000 israelis demonstrated in tel aviv on saturday against government corruption and prime minister benjamin netanyahu who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. the demonstration was by far the largest of weekly anti corruption protests sparked by corruption allegations against netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing.  the four term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases. the first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily. saturday s protest was prompted by a draft law expected to be ratified by parliament next week, which would bar police from publishing its findings in two investigations of netanyahu. a reuters cameraman and israeli media put the number of demonstrators at about 20,000. police would not provide an official estimate.  critics say the draft law is a blatant attempt to protect netanyahu and keep the public in the dark about his investigation. supporters of the legislation say it is meant to protect suspects  rights. netanyahu has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation but he has not ordered its two sponsors, close confidants in his likud party, to withdraw the bill. netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him:  there will be nothing because there is nothing.   if charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate.

" lebanese prime minister saad al hariri said on thursday gulf arab countries were planning no action against lebanon after a political crisis last month thrust it onto the front line of rivalry between saudi arabia and iran.  hariri has been a political ally of saudi arabia but his coalition government includes lebanon s powerful shi ite muslim hezbollah group, an ally of shi ite iran and sworn enemy of sunni muslim riyadh.  last month s political crisis, sparked when hariri announced his resignation while in saudi arabia, raised fear in lebanon that riyadh and its gulf allies would take economic action against the tiny mediterranean country.  in an interview broadcast from riyadh before he returned to lebanon and rescinded his resignation, hariri warned of possible gulf sanctions on lebanon and of a threat to the livelihood of lebanese workers in gulf states.  his remarks on thursday seemed aimed at reassuring that no such action was in the cards.  this is not going to happen. i assure you we have the best relationship with saudi arabia, we have a very good relationship with the uae, and most of the gulf,  he said at a business conference.      the gulf has a problem with one political party in lebanon and does not have a problem with the whole of lebanon,  hariri added, alluding to hezbollah.

" mexico will need to show “enormous pragmatism” in its dealings with donald trump’s government, president enrique pena nieto said on tuesday, as his administration prepares to seek common ground on trade and immigration issues. mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting the accession of trump to the u.s. presidency because of his repeated threats on the campaign trail to impose tariffs on mexican made goods and seal the country off behind a massive border wall. acknowledging that trump’s victory had generated some uncertainty, pena nieto reiterated his government would pursue dialogue with the next u.s. government to reach agreements. “we’ll have to work with enormous pragmatism to agree what’s useful and convenient for mexico and for the whole of north america,” he told a business summit in the central city of puebla, mexican headquarters of german carmaker volkswagen (vowg_p.de). the mexican president added that his government was committed to providing macroeconomic stability for investors, listing a flexible exchange rate, central bank independence and a solid banking system among the key planks of his pledge. concern has been widespread among business leaders and officials in mexico that trump could follow through on threats to abandon the north american free trade agreement (nafta) if he cannot renegotiate it in the united states’ interests. struck between the united states, mexico and canada, nafta took effect in 1994 and has been the cornerstone of mexican international trade policy. mexico sends four fifths of its goods exports to the united states. still, mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo believes trump will not back out of nafta, and has said mexico could add new chapters to the deal to update it.

" australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said on sunday he was confident a refugee resettlement deal with the united states would go ahead, despite white house comments which seemed to cast doubt about its future under a trump administration.  white house deputy spokesman eric schultz told reporters the deal to resettle in the u.s refugees currently held at australian funded offshore processing centers was reached with president barack obama, and it was the prerogative of each president to set policies. “we have one president at a time, schultz said on friday. “the president elect, donald trump, will set the policies once he takes the oath of office.” turnbull downplayed the comments when questioned by reporters in sydney on sunday. “it’s a very good arrangement and we are confident that we’ll continue through the change of administration,” the australian associated press quoted him saying. australia announced last month the obama administration had agreed to take a substantial number of the 1,200 refugees held on nauru and manus island in papua new guinea. the resettlement deal with united states came after turnbull agreed in september to take part in a u.s. led program to resettle refugees from guatemala, honduras and el salvador as part of australia’s annual intake of 18,750 asylum seekers. whether donald trump, who has advocated a ban on people from nations that had been “compromised by terrorism”, honors the agreement is uncertain.  u.s. homeland security officials were scheduled to begin assessing asylum seekers on nauru this week. many of asylum seekers at the camps are muslims who have fled conflicts in iraq, syria, afghanistan and pakistan. ian rintoul, from the refugee action coalition, said it was very clear the deal australia struck with the u.s. was not airtight. “the announcement was very hastily put together because they weren’t expecting trump to win and then it came very clear the whole deal could roll over,” he said.

" saad al hariri will return to lebanon from saudi arabia within two days, he said on tuesday, 10 days after his shock resignation as prime minister in a broadcast from riyadh. his abrupt resignation on nov. 4 sent lebanon spinning into political crisis and back onto the front line of the middle east power struggle between sunni muslim saudi arabia and shi ite iran.  iran s ally hezbollah holds major sway in lebanese politics. it has long been a foe of hariri but is part of the coalition government he formed last year and called for his return.  in his resignation he made bitter attacks on both iran and hezbollah, and top lebanese officials and politicians close to hariri have said saudi arabia coerced him to resign, dictated his statement and have held him under house arrest.  riyadh and hariri have both denied that. hariri is a political ally of riyadh and holds saudi nationality. he cited a fear of assassination and hezbollah s  sowing strife  in the arab world as his reasons for stepping down.      riyadh and hariri both oppose hezbollah s military role in syria, fighting alongside president bashar al assad, and what they allege is its participation in yemen s civil war alongside the houthi group against a saudi led coalition. hezbollah denies having a role in the yemen conflict. lebanese president michel aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to beirut to formally submit it. analysts say when hariri does so, members of parliament will nominate him to serve as prime minister once again, and aoun will ask him to form a new government.  that would open the door to a long period of political talks like those which preceded the formation of the national unity government that made hariri prime minister a year ago.  hariri is expected to call on aoun to convene political dialogue on key issues facing lebanon, chiefly on reaffirming the tiny country s policy of staying out of regional conflicts and hezbollah s role in conflicts outside lebanon s borders, senior political sources say. any attempt to keep hezbollah out of the government, in line with saudi wishes, will torpedo the talks, political sources say. riyadh regards hezbollah as a terrorist group.  hariri warned on sunday in his first interview since resigning of possible gulf arab sanctions against lebanon and of the risk to the livelihoods of the 300,000 400,000 lebanese in the gulf. lebanese foreign minister gebran bassil said in paris on tuesday that any punitive sanctions by saudi arabia on lebanon would impact the region and syrian refugees in the country.  bassil is a member of president aoun s political party. he said hariri needed to return to lebanon to prove he was free.  after hariri s resignation, saudi arabia accused the lebanese government of declaring war on it because of hezbollah s pivotal role in lebanese politics.  however, riyadh s western allies have struck a tone different from that of saudi arabia, appearing to throw their weight behind both hariri and the lebanese state, whose army is a major recipient of u.s. aid.  the european union high representative federica mogherini said on tuesday after a meeting with bassil that she expected hariri and his family to return to lebanon in the coming days.  on twitter, hariri said he was well but that his family was staying in saudi arabia.      sources across lebanon s political divide have said hariri struck a more compromising tone in his interview than in his resignation statement, at one point holding out the possibility of rescinding his decision to quit.  they say this represents a retreat by saudi arabia, attributing it to western pressure.  the maronite patriarch bechara boutros al rai, head of lebanon s biggest christian community, met hariri and saudi king salman and crown prince mohammed in riyadh on tuesday. saudi al arabiya television quoted him as saying he supported the reasons for hariri s resignation. his comments reflect the views of some politicians in lebanon s divided maronite community but not president aoun.  echoing saudi demands, mps from hariri s future movement called for a u.n. resolution from 2006 that demanded all militias in lebanon disarm to be respected.  hezbollah is the only lebanese group with a militia, and says it needs weapons to secure lebanon from israel. hezbollah s lebanese opponents have long demanded it disarm. lebanese politicians have previously held talks on hezbollah s arsenal as part of a dialogue on a national defense strategy, but have never seriously discussed disarming it.

" republican u.s. senators on wednesday delayed a committee vote on president donald trump’s pick to head the environmental protection agency after the panel’s democrats boycotted the meeting, saying that nominee scott pruitt doubts the science of climate change. the boycott in the senate environment and public works committee delayed the transition to a new administrator for the agency. senator ben cardin, a democrat, said he could not support pruitt, a republican and the attorney general of oklahoma, for a public health position because he “denies the sum of empirical science and the urgency to act on climate change.” at a committee confirmation hearing last month pruitt, who has sued the agency he intends to run more than a dozen times on behalf of the oil drilling state oklahoma, expressed doubt about climate change science. but pruitt said he would be would be obliged for now to uphold the agency’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that carbon dioxide emissions harm public health. the finding is the agency’s basis for regulations on those emissions.  senator tom carper, the panel’s top democrat, said pruitt had provided “woefully inadequate” answers to written questions and had not named one agency regulation that he supported. “if mr. pruitt is serious about leading this important agency, he should be more than willing to provide straightforward answers to our fundamental questions,” carper said. republicans decried the move by the democrats. “this is simply a senatorial temper tantrum,” said senator dan sullivan of alaska, another oil state. trump, like republican senator jim inhofe on the panel, has called climate change a hoax. trump has promised to make changes at the agency including doing away with previous president barack obama’s clean power plan that cracks down on emissions from coal fired electricity generators. the plan was suspended by the supreme court last year. john konkus, a spokesman for pruitt’s confirmation team, said democrats and the epa under obama had “put politics and rhetoric ahead of their core work and ahead of the welfare of the american public.” in 2013, republican senators on the panel boycotted then  obama’s second term pick for the agency, gina mccarthy, saying they were “completely unsatisfied” by her answers to more than 1,000 written questions they had asked her. she was eventually confirmed.

" u.s. defense secretary james mattis said on tuesday he was waiting for a plan from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that follows president donald trump’s south asia strategy before he makes a decision on how many additional troops to send to afghanistan. “when he brings that to me, i will determine how many more we need to send in,” mattis told reporters during a visit to baghdad. “it may or may not the number that is bandied about.” u.s. officials have said trump has given mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in afghanistan. in a speech on monday, trump offered few specifics but promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against u.s backed government forces in afghanistan. “we are not nation building. we are killing terrorists,” he said in a prime time televised address at a military base outside washington. trump also singled out pakistan for harboring militants. mattis said lessons learned from fighting islamic state in iraq would be used in afghanistan.  when asked how trump’s strategy would differ from those of previous administrations, he said the approach would be broader but provided no specifics. “there is a broader approach to this and it all comes down to the execution and we will have to stand and deliver on this. ... i understand the question, you’ll just have to watch it unfold to really get the answer to it,” mattis said. u.s. officials have told reuters in the past that possible  trump administration responses included expanding u.s. drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to pakistan and downgrading pakistan’s status as a major non nato ally. experts say that for years u.s. efforts to curb pakistan’s support for militant groups have failed and that further strengthening u.s. ties to india, pakistan’s arch enemy, undermine chances of a breakthrough with islamabad. “(trump) demanded strategic shifts in pakistan without credible carrots or sticks while utterly ignoring the rest of the major regional players like china, iran and russia that back pakistan’s approach,” said sameer lalwani, a senior associate at the stimson center think tank.

" missing from president donald trump’s budget proposal this week was an annual report, known as the green book, that presidents have issued for many years to spell out their tax goals in detail, an omission that tax experts called telling. the green book, named for the color of its cover in recent years, is not that big a deal as a document, but its absence this year shows that the trump white house lacks a clear vision for what to do about overhauling the tax code, experts said. “i think it’s as simple as no tax plan equals no green book,” said donald marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the urban institute, a liberal think tank. democratic lawmakers on thursday in two senate hearings criticized the president’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on tuesday, and some of its core tax components. democratic senator chris van hollen called the budget proposal and its tax assumptions “fantasy flim flam.” treasury secretary steven mnuchin, appearing at one of the hearings, said the budget proposal did not consider how new tax laws would impact government revenues and the deficit because the trump administration did not have a detailed tax proposal. “when the president’s budget was done, we were not ready to have a full blown tax reform plan,” mnuchin said, adding that tax details would be worked out with congress, then made public. a treasury department official said separately it would not help to publish details while talks with congress were underway. “releasing a green book of tax policy proposals as we work towards comprehensive tax reform would contradict that effort,” the treasury official said in an email. the last green book was issued by the obama administration in february 2016 and ran 283 pages. past green books going back to 1990 are available on the treasury department website. as a candidate, trump, in his 125th day in power, promised voters that he would work with congress and seek passage in his first 100 days of “massive tax reduction and simplification.” he has not yet offered any tax legislation. on april 26, the administration released a one page list of tax proposals summarized in 12 bullet points. tuesday’s budget repeated the one page summary, including a proposal to end the estate tax on inheritances paid by a few wealthy americans. despite this policy position, the trump budget included a projection of $328 billion in estate tax revenues for 2018 2027. “i’ve seen lots of tricky budgets before, but this may take the cake,” said democratic senator mark warner. “you assume abolishment of the so called death tax, estate tax, but ... you still count the revenues from the estate and gift tax, which is kind of a tricky thing. i would call that double counting.” ",0
" lebanon prime minister saad al hariri said late on friday he is on his way to the airport in saudi arabia.  hariri, who sparked a crisis by resigning as lebanese prime minister on nov. 4 during a visit to saudi arabia, tweeted,  to say that i am held up in saudi arabia and not allowed to leave the country is a lie. i am on the way to the airport...    earlier a member of his party said hariri will leave riyadh for france on friday, but will not return directly to beirut after the visit.  hariri s abrupt resignation while he was in saudi arabia and his continued stay there caused fears over lebanon s stability and thrust it into the bitter rivalry between riyadh and iran.

" u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump said he had a “very, very good meeting” with u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan on thursday to try to patch up differences on policy proposals and the tone of his insurgent campaign. “i thought it was really a very, very good meeting. i think paul felt the same way and everybody else did also,” trump said in an excerpt of an interview to be broadcast thursday night on fox news. “i don’t mind going through a little bit of a slow process. it’s a very big subject. we have a lot of things. i think for the most part we agree on a lot of different items,” trump said.

" new york governor andrew cuomo and new jersey governor chris christie said on tuesday they will replace two top executives at the powerful bi state agency that controls many of the region’s most critical transportation assets. port authority of new york and new jersey executive director pat foye, whom cuomo appointed to the authority in 2011, and chairman john degnan, whom christie appointed in 2014, are leaving. the shakeup comes amid a struggle to find a chief executive officer. this is a new position created under reforms intended to clean up the agency after the “bridgegate” scandal raised questions of political meddling. resuming the ceo search will be “one of the first priorities” for the incoming officers, cuomo and christie said in a joint statement. replacing foye is rick cotton, cuomo’s special counsel since january 2015 who has overseen some of the governor’s highest profile infrastructure projects. those projects include a replacement for the tappan zee bridge, a $4 billion public private partnership to renovate laguardia airport’s central terminal and the transformation of an historic post office into a grand waiting hall for pennsylvania station, the busiest transport hub in the nation. tapped to lead the board is kevin o’toole, a lawyer, christie ally and former long time state senator who joined the board in march. o’toole and cotton are expected to be sworn in at a special meeting of the port authority board on thursday. the authority has been slow to fully adopt governance changes after the bridgegate controversy. in 2013, a former port authority executive, david wildstein, shut down lanes at the george washington bridge to cause massive traffic jams as punishment for a local mayor who declined to support christie’s gubernatorial re election bid. in his resignation letter to christie on tuesday, chairman degnan said he was “disappointed” that the ceo position has not yet been implemented. he highlighted changes including posting board meeting agendas and materials online well in advance, allowing the public to comment before board votes, and new guidelines on recusals and oversight. degnan had championed a replacement for the authority’s crumbling 42nd street bus terminal in manhattan, helping to secure about $3.5 billion for the project in the authority’s latest capital plan. degnan told reuters in an email that he did not have specific plans other to “increase my attention to nonprofit boards i sit on and watch my grandchildren grow up.” ",0
